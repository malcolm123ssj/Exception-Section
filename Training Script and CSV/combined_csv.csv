All the properties are registered in his name, an official said on the condition of anonymity. BBMP officials have not ruled out the possibility of other properties registered in the name of the IMA Group and are trying to identify them.

Man who invested Rs 9L in IMA dies of heart attack	A 54-year-old man who had invested in the IMA Group died of a heart attack at a private hospital on Thursday evening. His colleague attributed the death to the IMA scam as his daughter was to marry next month. Abdul Pasha, from Vinayaka Nagar, Mysuru Road, collapsed at a factory in Peenya where he worked. His colleague, Mallikarjun, rushed him to a hospital where he died later. Three years ago, Pasha invested Rs 9 lakh in the company which has now gone bust. He had married off two of his four daughters. The third was to get married next month. He had made all the arrangements for the wedding. Pasha applied for the withdrawal of his principal amount after the company reduced the monthly dividend a few months ago. But he hadn't get the money back. On June 10, when the news broke that the IMA founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan had gone missing and the company shut down, Pasha went into depression and filed a police complaint. He reported for work on Thursday but appeared depressed. He told his colleagues that he'd lost all his savings. He took rest after lunch but suddenly collapsed around 4 pm.

Citizens suffer as fallen trees, branches lie uncleared	Trees and branches that were brought down by rain last week and causing havoc on the roads have still not been cleared by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).At many places, the fallen trees and branches have been piled up on the road side, blocking footpaths and clogging drains at some places. Residents fear a bigger mess in the event of rains, which are likely to fall anytime soon.Around 415 trees, 1,381 branches and many electric poles were uprooted due to heavy rain and wind last week in areas like Hanumanthnagar, Srinagar, Hoskerehalli and Raja Rajeshwari Nagar. Though the civic bodies acted swiftly and cleared the paths, it is yet to shift fallen trees and branches.“The fallen trees and branches are turning hotspots for snakes and insects. We feel scared to walk by these fallen trees and branches. They are also blocking drains. If it rains anytime soon, then there will be water-logging,” Savitha, a resident of Raja Rajeshwari Nagar told DH.There are many areas where the BBMP has still not cleared the fallen trees. Vishwanath, a resident of Hanumanthnagar said, “When we ask BBMP to clear the mess, officials say they are short of men and machines. Trees have not been cleared even a week after they were uprooted and they are causing a stench in the locality.”When the BBMP forest cell was asked about the situation, they denied there was any shortage of staff or vehicles for the woek.“The situation is because of the unexpected rain. We did not expect it to create so much havoc in the city. We have a team to address these issues. I have also deputed engineers from other zones to clear the mess. The trees will be cleared by this week,” Chola Raju, deputy conservator of forest, BBMP Forest Cell told DH.	monsoon,BBMP,Rain damage,Benglauru,	 Jun 13 2019

Poultry farmers seek dropping of notification	The Karnataka Poultry Farmers and Breeders Association (KPFBA) on Wednesday urged the Government of India to immediately drop the latest notification — ‘Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (egg-laying hens) Rules 2019’ — saying it would have an adverse impact on the entire poultry sector in the country.The members of the association alleged that the government was heeding the advice of animal welfare NGOs who have little knowledge about poultry farming.As per the new rules, the size of cages at poultry farms should not be less than 550 sq cm per bird and 6-8 birds per cage. It also regulated the use of antibiotics only for therapeutic use and under the supervision of a veterinarian, and called for regular inspection of poultry farms by authorised personnel who should follow proper bio-security protocols.The poultry sector has been given five years to switch over to new systems.“The parameters recommended regarding space requirement, behavioural needs and other welfare concerns are based on studies conducted in the European Union nations, which are not relevant to India. NGOs which have lobbied for a ban of cages have painted a wrong picture of the poultry sector.Healthy birds mean healthy business for poultry farmers and they have been continuously improving practices in farms to maintain hygiene and other conditions. Bird losses for a farmer mean loss of livelihood,” said Deve Gowda, vice-president of the World Poultry Science Association (India Branch).	KPFBA,poultry farming,	 Jun 13 2019
‘Morbid obesity, damaged knee trap patients’	The morbid obesity of a 71-year-old retired man has put the spotlight on a growing epidemic of unhealthy weight-gain, a common feature among India’s adults.The man, an Indian national residing in the United States, has been referred to Manipal Hospitals for a knee replacement surgery, after another hospital had refused to treat him due to concerns of medical complications.Dr Lokesh Veerappa, a joint replacement surgeon designated as the treating physician, identified a larger lifestyle flaw as the bedridden patient used a CPAP breathing machine to compensate for his respiratory problems.“His obesity was at the root of all his (health) problems,” Dr Veerappa said. “He stopped walking, which led to the worsening of his health, and was the onset of depression.” The combination of knee osteoarthritis and morbid obesity traps patients in a vicious cycle of bad health and lack of exercise, Dr Veerappa explained, as the knees suffer early damage and prevent the patient from exercising and losing weight.Dr Veerappa said the patient regained mobility following the successful knee replacement and lost several kilos of weight.A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research–India Diabetes noted how the country’s growing affluence is transforming the health issues faced by citizens. “Under-nutrition due to poverty, which dominated in the past, is being rapidly replaced by obesity associated with affluence, resulting in an estimated 88 million individuals in the country who are overweight,” it said.The study also said 135 million individuals have generalised obesity, 153 million with abdominal obesity and 107 million with combined obesity.City-based endocrinologist Dr A Sharda said the trend that afflicts all age groups reflects the changing nature of the Indian dietary preferences. The shrinking public space for exercise and recreation is a factor in the growing sedentary lifestyle of people, she added.	knee pain,Obesity,Health Care,	 Jun 13 2019

Karnataka Jain Association to complete 100 years	The Karnataka Jain Association on KR road, Bengaluru is all set to complete 100 years next week, and will be among the very few associations in the country to mark their centenary.Established in 1918 in Mysuru, the association was initially named Mysore Jain Association. M L Vardhamanaiah, the founder president of the association established it in the Chandragupta Road, in the heritage city. The association shifted to Bengaluru in 1971.According to members of the association, though they hail from Karnataka and speak Kannada fluently, there is a misconception that they belong to North India.“The members of Karnataka Jain Association belong to Digambara sects and we have origins from Karnataka. Since we also use the surname ‘Jain’ some people assume we hail from North India,” Jitendra Kumar, president, Karnataka Jain Association told DH. Jitendra will complete 20 years in office as the president of the association. He has decided to quit and will not contest in next election scheduled in September.Karnataka Jain Association has 8,000 registered members in Bengaluru alone and also has branch offices at all the districts of the state. So far, the association has seen only 12 presidents.The association had become dysfunctional for a few years in Mysuru due to lack of effective leadership in the early 60s. Later, the Jain community in Bengaluru took charge of the Mysore-based association and established it on KR Road in Basavangudi, Bengaluru by providing hostels, halls and a temple for people of the community.During the valedictory function of the centenary celebrations, a book talking about the journey of the society will be released.

Govt school’s walls coloured after whitewash setback	A government school in Victoria Layout, Yalagonda Palya, in the news recently for turning pale with an abrupt whitewash, has gained back its beauty.Volunteers who transformed the school with their wonderful art works in January saw the Election Commission whitewashing the walls on account of the model code of conduct, though the paintings did not have any political significance.The same group of volunteers turned up at the school on June 5 and painted it back to its vibrancy. Marking World Environment Day, the volunteers also planted saplings at the school premises along with the city police commissioner. The saplings planted were named after Kannada poets.Local residents and school students also joined hands with the volunteers from the Shilpa Foundation and Fedilitus Art Gallery, who beautified the school as part of their CSR initiative.“We painted the walls with new art works. Now, it sports flowers, pencil, plants and butterflies, among other things,” Achyuth Gowda, founder, Fedilitus Corp, told DH.He said the volunteers think it their duty to beautify the school once again. “This was like a welcome event for the students who are starting a new academic year,” Gowda said.The company spent Rs 20,000 on the initiative.On whether the volunteers had asked the EC the reason behind whitewashing the school, Gowda said: “Let’s not blame anyone here. The officials have only done their duty. We waited for the school to reopen and now we found the right time to (re-beautify) it.”	government school,Bengaluru,	 Jun 09 2019

Bengalureans leading the way in tackling water crisis	Every summer, water, or rather the lack of it, always becomes the topic of concern in Bengaluru. Recently, 670 Bengalureans signed a petition launched by the Bangalore Apartments’ Federation (BAF) to conserve water through various measures, keeping in mind the current water crisis the city is currently facing. This petition was for the citizens as opposed to the usual address to the authorities.DH had earlier reported that BAF, which represents over 70,000 apartments, had also conducted the BAFHalfBucketChallenge, a social media campaign urging its members to bathe in half a bucket of water to tackle the issue of water shortage. Their objective is to generate consciousness about water preservation among citizens.In this petition, the residents are provided with certain suggestions which could prove to be beneficial considering that Bengaluru is in the throes of a water crisis with erratic supply of Cauvery water and groundwater running dry in several places. Suggestions included installations of smart water meters, installation of tap aerators in taps, simple but effective measures like checking taps and faucets for leaks, using washing machines with only full load, cleaning vehicles without water, collecting RO waste water for household cleaning and so on.There have been initiatives taken up by various citizen-based associations and organisations to collectively come up with solutions for this problem which holds long-term implications.ADDA, a company that offers an integrated apartment management software for gated communities, organised a water workshop, a third of its kind to find solutions to the water crisis. It brought to light several ongoing sustainable water management measures.With a focus on gated communities, representatives of Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), citizen groups and activists met on March 23, at the The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) campus, Domlur, to seek solutions to the ongoing water crisis- monitoring of water consumption in apartment complexes, avoiding the usage of showers while bathing and working with Ward Committees to ensure proper drainage system to name a few. Improvement in utilisation of existing rainwater harvesting programmes and digging of wells to recharge groundwater are essential steps to be implemented.Whitefield Rising (WFR) is a civic group which has regularly made conscious and sustained efforts to rejuvenate lakes in Whitefield and to organise workshops on water management. Their emphasis has been on the need to reuse water and to set up Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in the area. STP-treated water can be used in gardens and car washing and dual piping installation can help in using the treated water for toilet flushing.The theory of ‘Ecowaternomics’ is widely discussed by almost every association aiming to make the situation better for future generations. It looks at the economics of using less water from two angles – using less and reusing more.True to its identity as a tech and start-up hub, Bengaluru has had innovations that could go a long way in tackling the issue at hand. Biome Environmental Solutions is another Bengaluru-based design firm having an expertise in providing knowledge services water management and rainwater harvesting, ecological wastewater treatment and sanitation practices, highlights limiting citizens’ demand for water since relying on the supply side was not a sustainable solution.SmarterHomes by Vivek Shukla (helps users track water usage), OpenWater.In by Sanjiv Sambadan, IISc professor (converts waste water to potable water) and the like have opened up new doors.Importance of individual contributions towards saving water cannot be overlooked. Furthermore, there is a need to engage knowledge partners, authorities and citizens in conversation to bring about real change and prevent the water issue from spiraling out, beyond our control.

Thunderstorm destruction writ large on city landscape	The downpour of the past two nights brought down hundreds of trees, electricity poles and transformers, besides inflicting damage on scores of vehicles and plunging large parts of the city into darkness. The damage was so extensive in northern and western Bengaluru that Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara had to visit many areas on Monday and order civic officials to get cracking. As per the latest count, at least 100 trees and 500 branches have been uprooted. Parameshwara, who visited Vijayanagar, Malleswaram, West of Chord Road and other areas affected by the heavy rain, asked the officials to clear the debris immediately. He also instructed Bescom officials to restore the power supply. Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, Vijayanagar MLA M Krishnappa and others accompanied him during the inspection. Speaking to reporters later, Parameshwara said a total of 61 teams from the BBMP, Bescom and other departments were working overtime to clear the debris from streets and restore the power supply. “The BBMP control room enabled us to be aware of the rain-related problems in real time,” he added. Stating that some parts of Karnataka had received more than 120 mm of rainfall in the past few days, the deputy chief minister stressed that the BBMP was well-prepared for the monsoon that was expected to arrive in Bengaluru in a few days.He said he had instructed the officials at an earlier meeting to take the necessary steps to tackle the problems arising out of monsoon. He said low-lying areas of the city had not been flooded and sought to take credit for that. Parameshwara held another meeting with BBMP and Bescom officials about the rain preparedness, asking the agencies about the steps they had taken to avoid the flooding of streets and the potholes on roads. BBMP officials replied that they were removing silt from stormwater drains and that a premix of bitumen and sand had arrived from Tamil Nadu to fill up potholes. Parameshwara further ordered the officials to clear garbage black spots as these might block rainwater and emit a foul smell leading to health hazards. He also asked the officials of the BBMP control room and other helplines to remain alert throughout the monsoon. Officials said they were planning to raise awareness about the dangers of power lines by conducting painting and essay competitions on the topic for schoolchildren.

Students spearhead menstruation campaign	"A group of 13 youngsters is reaching out to women, spreading awareness on menstrual hygiene. They are persuading the underprivileged to switch to eco-friendly practices. The informal bunch are school students from Bengaluru.Their goal? Every woman should be able to manage menstruation in a hygienic and dignified way.Led by a grade 12 science student, the team calls itself RutuChakra. Sanjana Dixit from the National Public School formed the group in January 2018.Having conducted multiple workshops and awareness programmes, RutuChakra has managed to raise Rs 4.5 lakh through crowdfunding.It all began when Sanjana visited an orphanage early last year and used a washroom there.""I started questioning the awareness level among underprivileged girls. I was wondering if they knew what safe menstruation meant,"" she said.Availability was a question, Sanjana observed. ""When I spoke to the person in charge there, I understood that many donate stationery and clothes. None gave money or donated supplies when it came to menstruation,"" she added.Sanjana believes, along with safety, sustainability is an important factor. As RutuChakra reaches out to women under 18, they are educated about sanitary napkins and are supplied reusable sanitary pads. However, for those above 18, options such as menstrual cups are recommended.RutuChakra has supported over 550 girls and women, distributed 33,000 sanitary napkins and conducted over 11 workshops so far.Sanjana said she was waiting to turn 18 so that she could have her NGO registered. ""For now, I have a team that is passionate -- school students from various backgrounds,"" she said.Sanjana hopes to pursue a career in either molecular biology or biotechnology."

Ouch! Itching powder available for Rs 50 online	"It could be used to play a prank or to mug an innocent passerby, but the alarming thing about the itching powder is that people can get it online. Weeks ago, the city woke up to the news that a gang using itching powder to steal is back in business, but no regulation is in place as the e-commerce sites are selling them for anyone. Sold in names like ‘itching powder’ or ‘itch powder’, the substance is touted by e-commerce portals as something to play pranks with. While anyone can get them for as little as Rs 50, doctors warn that the chemicals in the powder can be potentially harmful. City-based paediatrician Dr Manjunath Sharma believed it could be safe to use powders that contain natural ingredients as mentioned online, but the ones with chemicals could aggravate allergies as it caused persistent itching.“We’re not aware of the long-term side effects,” he said. While in some cases it leaves severe irritation, it could create permanent scars in others, Dr Girish M S, Head, Department of Dermatology, ESIC Rajajinagar. ""It is shocking that this is even available online. Although the main purpose could be a prank, there should be a discretely use. It leads to inflammation and irritation in children. It would lead to contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals,"" Dr Girish said.Iron causes irritationThough the powders are made of rose hips or maples, the tiny pieces of iron cause more irritation. “on scratching, this could leave permanent scars,” Dr Girish said.Meanwhile, having known about the way the itching powder is misused, Shashi Kumar D, general secretary, KAMS said, ""If it is available online, we will approach the government and seek a ban. Although school children might find it tough to purchase the powder without parents' knowledge, college students will be more vulnerable."""	Bengaluru,	 May 25 2019

The trial run is all set to take off in Bengaluru. Postmen across the city will deliver farm fresh mangoes to your doorstep.

However, arrangements will be made for delivery within one or two days,” an official communication by the postal department reads.The Mango Development Board has launched a website which hosts the details of farmers and the varieties of mangoes cultivated. It also has details about the location where they are grown. Customers can place their orders online.C G Nagaraju, managing director, Mango Development Board, said that previously the board had orders from 96 customers, most of which have been cleared. “We had challenges finding the postal code and address. Having thought about the possible solutions, we approached the GPO and they consented. We have on board 15 farmers who are certified to have good agricultural practices. This is being done on a trial basis here and will be expanded across the state,” he said. Farmers are expected to deliver mangoes to the warehouse before dawn from where the dispatch will happen. Packaging, ensuring the address is mentioned and the liberty of fixing prices have been given to the farmers.Orders can be placed on karsirimangoes.karnataka.gov.in.

LGBTQIA+ members now more open to dating, love: Survey	Compared to five years ago, there is less stigma attached to the LGBTQIA+ community today, says 70% of community members surveyed by online dating App, Tinder. This fresh insight into how the community feels about love, dating and friendships followed Tinder's foray into multi-gender relationships late last year. Probing deeper, the survey got the community talking about identity, public display of affection (PDA) and more. In an interesting revelation, the survey found that 61% had identified themselves as LGBTQIA+ on an online platform or closed group prior to formally coming out to friends/family.A Tinder statement explained why it surveyed LGBTQIA+ community members: To understand India’s shifting cultural paradigm, their attitude towards dating and dating culture, how dating apps are empowering authentic identities and helping erode stigma.Here's another insight from the survey: LGBTQIA+ are comfortable with PDA on a date when it comes to hugging (60%), holding hands (62%) or kissing (44%). But a high 70% want their date to be involved in issues that the community faces. Increased normalisation of different sexual orientations has made it easier for members of the LGBTQIA+ community to be open and honest about their dating lives (30%). This is particularly true for Tinder users (38% compared to 17% of non-dating app/site users), the survey notes.More than a quarter of LGBTQIA+ people (30%) say the pressure to be in a relationship has lessened in the last five years. One in five say they are less ashamed of their single status than they were five years ago The top three issues amongst LGBTQIA+ community, the survey found, are religious freedom (38%), workplace inequality (32%) and youth homelessness (32%). The research findings were based on a survey conducted across India between March 19 and April 18. As many as 500 respondents were asked general questions to explore their attitudes around their LGBTQ+ identity as it pertains to dating and dating culture. The study targeted consumers between the ages of 18-45 years old who identify as LGBTQ+.	LGBTQ,Tinder,	 May 15 2019

She had pledged to end her strike only after AFSPA, which gave the army extra-judicial powers, was scrapped.She collapsed six days into her strike on November 11, 2000, and thereafter was fortified with a Ryle’s tube, feeding nutrients directly into her body. In 2014, she weighed 46 kg, nine kg lower than the national average for women.Repeatedly arrested for “attempted suicide”, she continued with resolve.On August 9, 2016, with AFSPA still in force, Sharmila licked a drop of honey off her hand, signalling the end of her protest, pledging to enter politics to continue her fight against the act.Nominated in 2005 for the Peace Nobel, she is often called ‘The Iron Lady of Manipur’ and ‘Mengoubi’, meaning ‘The Fair One’.

Moonwalk with a twist	Twenty-five-year-old Prakash, can give other youngsters like him a run for their money, pulling off the Michael Jackson moonwalk. But what makes Prakash different is that he suffers from cerebral palsy. He is one of the many aspiring differently abled persons in the city, learning to dance thanks to the efforts of a group of volunteers.Differently abled dancers compete and perform in various events alongside the volunteers. The group has volunteers and differently abled dancers who strive to promote inclusive dancing through Attam, an inclusive dance school.“In 2015, Prakash was the only differently abled person in our group. He was incredibly talented and passionate about dancing, evident in his scintillating steps. We knew there were many like Prakash, who might not have a helping hand. It was then that we decided to fill this gap by teaching them dancing,” says Shruti Chinnasamy, dance coordinator and corporate professional.Other differently abled talents in the group include hearing impaired Annie, who performs in various dance events and Saroja, a visually impaired Bharatanayam dancer, whose steps speak her heart. Dinesh, a wheelchair-bound dancer loves Bollywood as his shoulders and arms sway to the tunes.“We train volunteers in teaching dance to the differently abled. There are certain techniques involved in teaching dance to them based on their abilities. Persons with hearing impairment are quick to learn the steps as they can watch and pick up,” notes Shruti.As for the visually impaired, one has to hold them and teach them steps. They may need more time to learn. Those with autism are not comfortable dancing to loud music and hence special care is required.“For those with physical disabilities that restrict movement, we have to teach them dance keeping in mind their abilities. In the case of the wheelchair-bound, we teach them dance involving their shoulders and hands,” says Shruti.The group meets twice a month and also performs in various dance events, corporate gigs and fundraising events.“A special memory close to our heart was when a marathon was kicked off with our differently abled dancers helping runners dance to their steps before the run,” adds Shruti.

Off duty, fitness a mantra for this sub-inspector	Despite his busy routine, Arjun C R, a 35-year-old police sub-inspector, finds time to work out and maintains a six-pack. Arjun is quite the craze in police circles. He even has a fan club of sorts that is inspiring many to squeeze in some fitness time amid tight schedules. DCP (South) K Annamalai and other senior officials have lauded the determination of this PSI posted at the Banashankari police station.“I had never visited a gym in my life until the last six to seven months,” says Arjun. In 2014, Arjun suffered an anterior cruciate ligament tear in the knee, which required surgery. The PSI, then a kabaddi player, was injured during a match. “I was on rest for 4-5 months, unable to bend my knees. I gained a lot of weight,” Arjun recalls.At 90 kg, Arjun wanted to lose weight and be fit. He hit the gym and followed a proper diet, apart from the 12-hour policing duty. “I was active during nights while studying engineering,” remembered Arjun, an engineer who graduated from the Ghousia College of Engineering, Ramanagaram. Arjun leaves home around 7.30 am and reports for duty an hour later. Until 10.30 pm, he is busy at work. After returning home, he works out from 11 pm to 1 am. Arjun sticks to a protein-rich diet -- boiled chicken and fish. His carbs intake is low. Totally avoiding junk food, he’s been working out every single day for the last seven months.

Sex workers, demand dignity, respect	Demanding respect and dignity at their workplace hundreds of sanitation workers, migrant workers, domestic helpers and sex workers descended on Majestic area for a massive demonstration on May Day on Wednesday.Joining together under the banner ‘Bevaru’ (Sweat), the workers put up posters depicting their plight and harassment at the workplace.Interestingly, according to the organisers, this was for the first time that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike declared holiday on May Day for both the temporary workers as well as those who are on the payrolls.Ekta of Maraa, a media and arts collective which was one of the organisers of the demonstration, said the event aligning with the Labour Day was planned at Majestic area as most of these workers work in the vicinity and it would be easier for them to participate and seek public attention.“A worker, regardless of the kind of work, not only works for money but also command respect,” Ekta commented.The workers registered their dissent against the abusive nature of the police personnel and harassment by their supervisors at companies.

In the middle of nowhere, forced out of Uber ride	Questions over safety of travelling in Uber cabs came to the fore once again after a Uber driver left a family in the middle of the road for declining to utilise his service outside the ambit of the app. The cab aggregator is receiving brickbats online for the “callousness”.Rishi Bhatia, travelling with his wife and three-year-old child, booked a cab at 10 pm on Sunday night from Kempegowda International Airport. After starting the journey, the driver told the couple to cancel the trip and ride outside Uber’s network, which will save him the commission paid to Uber, which is 25% of the fare.The couple declined. “Since we were near the airport, we asked him to drop us (at airport) so we can get another cab. But he was not ready to do that either. He switched off the AC, locked the windows and doors. We felt really unsafe,” Neha Sehgal Bhatia, Rishi’s wife, wrote in a Facebook post, which went viral.The couple then called the police (100) and some security guards passing by for help to reach the airport. “(As) the security of the airport intervened, he (driver) just ran away, dropping our luggage in the middle of the road (sic),” she said.In between, they called Uber helpline. The recorded conversation shows that Uber will not offer any help in such circumstances. In the eight-minute conversation, the helpless executive at customer care says he can’t do anything other than advising the passenger to call the police.Repeated incidentsIn December 2018, DH contacted Uber several times over the recent trend of drivers urging customers to cancel the rides and travel off the Uber app. In one incident, a customer travelling to the airport was stranded on road.The cab arrived but the driver insisted that the customer cancel the Uber booking. “The driver offered that I can pay Rs 100 less than the amount shown in the app. But we did not want to take the cab owing to lack of safety,” said Aradhya (name changed).Responding to Neha’s post, Uber released a statement: “We regret the inconvenience caused to the rider. This form of misconduct by a driver partner violates our community guidelines. We are investigating this matter and will take necessary actions, as needed. Safety is paramount to Uber and we are deeply committed to it.”However, Neha noted that Uber never contacted her after the incident to enquire about her safety. Several individuals expressed shock and shared similar experiences online.Commenting on Neha’s status, many shared similar experiences with Uber and urged her to take action. “This is very common with Uber. You may file a case against Uber, since it’s their deficiency in service. They are liable for your safety,” John Deep Pandian wrote on Facebook.	Uber,	 May 02 2019
Techie bribes cop to get lost mobile phone	A software engineer has accused the Bellandur police of demanding a bribe to return her mobile phone that she lost while riding in an Uber cab.Following her complaint, the police had tracked and recovered the phone.Posting her complaint on the Bengaluru City Police Facebook page, Ritu Rawat said she had to negotiate with the police and paid Rs 2,500 to get her mobile phone back.Ritu mentioned in the post that her friend left the phone in the cab. “We were sure that cab driver had taken it, we went to Bellandur police station, we gave the driver’s number and cop called the driver and he was scared and next day, he returned the phone at the station stating that he told police that he found it in the car,” Ritu’s post read. “When we went to collect the phone, the policeman at the station asked half of the phone’s value (as bribe), which is Rs 7,000, for returning the phone.” She threatened to take the matter to the superior officers, but that only prompted the policeman to demand more bribe. “In the end, having no way out, we paid him Rs 2,500 and got the phone,” she said.She tagged City Police Commissioner T Suneel Kumar in the post, who directed senior jurisdictional police officers to look into the matter. Following direction from the senior police, Bellandur police inspector summoned all the staff and recorded their statements.“I have questioned the staff about the incident, but they are saying they’re not aware of it. So, we wrote to Ritu Rawat asking her to visit the station and identify the staff who demanded and accepted the bribe from her,” he said.	stolen,Bengaluru City Police,Mobile,	 Apr 29 2019
Govt for hospital regulation following Nigerian’s death	The state government called on the public to report overcharging by hospitals and said it will look into enhancing protection of patients in the wake of a Deccan Herald news report on April 25, detailing the death of a Nigerian national at Manipal Hospitals.Speaking to DH, principal secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, Jawaid Akhtar said that a provision exists within the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments (KPME) Act, allowing the public to report any hospital, dispensary or clinic that charges more than the established rate for services and care.“Public must file complaints with the health and family welfare commissioner, who is the chairman of the expert committee. An inquiry will be conducted and action will be taken,” he said and suggested that Tobi Ajisegbede of Lagos, Nigeria, who lost his mother, Juliet, at Manipal Hospitals on April 14, should write to the commissioner, asking him to initiate an inquiry.Activists and lawyers pointed out that while the KPME Act can address matters of financial abuse, it offers little in the way of offering succour to victims of negligence.Vijayakumar Seetappa of the medical watchdog, Karnataka Janaarogya Chaluvali, said a few Indian victims of negligence are able to get justice, much less than the thousands of foreign visitors who come for medical care.“There is no mechanism for redressal at all because medical care in India exists in a regulatory vacuum,” Seetappa said.City-based lawyer Taji George, who holds the same view, provided evidence of several cases of negligence by hospitals. “About 10% of all medical failures are a result of negligence and most of the victims are foreigners,” George said. “And, what is the government doing? Nothing.”Though the government mandates treatment rates, George said that a few hospitals display figures right, leading to exorbitant charges for treatment.With increasing cases of negligence, Akhtar said the government will strengthen regulations. “We are planning to appraise and train our people to be more vigilant,” he said. However, the system will only work if the public files complaints with the committee, the principal secretary added. A recap of the caseTobi Ajisegbede from Lagos, Nigeria, who lost his 58-year-old mother at Manipal Hospitals on April 14, alleged medical negligence of the hospital staff, and a pattern of extortion by the administration. For $10,000 (Rs 6,98,000), the hospital offered quick and effective results to Ajisegbede’s mother who was suffering from Lumbar Canal Stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal, compressing the nerves). But what ensued, according to Ajisegbede, was five months of prolonged treatment, which not only cost him and his family over $20,000 (Rs 13,96,000) but also his mother’s lifeOverview of medical tourismBetween 2014 and 2015, there were 4,60,000 foreigners who sought some form of treatment in Indian hospitals — 41,237 of whom had come to India on medical visas. According to figures from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics of India, these tourists added Rs 5,800,000,000 ($86.6 million) to the Indian economy.	surgeries,Medical Negligence,Regulation of hospitals,	 Apr 29 2019
Horns used by garbage compactors a nuisance: residents	The BBMP’s garbage-collecting vehicles may be diligently performing their duties, but their high decibel horns are a bugbear of residents. Residents of Vidyaranyapura, Indiranagar and other East Bengaluru neighbourhoods have complained that the blast of high decibel horns by the garbage vehicles creates a ruckus, especially in the morning hours. “We know the vehicles follow a particular timing (every day) and we keep our bins ready by the time they arrive. But they make this unbearable noise. At least the (horns) must be low decibel,” said Narayanamurthy, a senior citizen residing in Vidyaranyapura.Garbage contractors said the residents do not come out quickly with their bins unless they blast the horns. “Our vehicles in Hagadur have horns with reasonable (decibel) levels. We don’t make noise, but in (some) areas, they blast the horns to alert the residents. We can’t help it,” said a BBMP contractor from Hagadur.BBMP special commissioner Randeep Singh said the compactors, which are secondary waste collectors, are not supposed to use horns, something only auto tippers can.“In areas like Indiranagar, auto tippers (primary waste collectors) use whistles or, sometimes, cycle bells. In some areas, they play music, but low decibel. If we come across garbage compactors using horns, we’ll take action,” Singh said.	BBMP,Garbage collection,	 Apr 28 2019
QR code to check plastic	Manufacturers of biodegradable bags often lie about the microns of plastic in their products. Now, Bengaluru-based Ibhaan Digital Edge Advance Solution Pvt Ltd has come up with a solution to identify such substandard products.The city-based company along with 22 other biodegradable bag manufactures have joined hands and started imprinting QR code (Quick Response) on the bags.The QR code will help the consumers authenticate the bags on sale are indeed biodegradable.“It shows the name of the manufacturer, their details, date of manufacture, microns and durability of the bag,” S Sairam, director, Ibhaan Digital Edge Advance Solution told DH.“As many consumers are contributing to the mess, this move helps them use authentic products that are eco-friendly as proposed by the civic body. This has been supported by the Indian Compostable Polymer Association (ICPA) and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. 22 top biodegradable bag manufacturers are about to get permission from the BBMP,” said Sairam.In 2016, Karnataka government imposed a ban on manufacturing, storing, using and distributing single-use plastics such as carry bags, flex banners, plates, cups, spoons and the like.But the ban has not been completely effective due to many reasons including the fact that policy makers and manufacturers have failed to provide sustainable alternatives and raise community awareness.The BBMP had imposed a ban on the use of plastic below 40 microns in its limits.“This can also be termed as the aadhaar card for the bags as it helps both lawmakers and the common man,” Sairam added.

Security beefed up at city churches for Sunday service	A week after the Easter blasts in Sri Lanka, several churches across Bengaluru have made elaborate security arrangements for Sunday services.With the Home Department in Karnataka sounding high alert across the state, several churches have sent out multiple advisories to devotees and members of the parish regarding masses on Sunday (observed as Divine Mercy Sunday by the Roman Catholic Church).The Bengaluru City Police had issued a security alert in the wake of the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka, and directed religious heads to beef up security and report to police about any suspicious activities on their premises. Following the orders, the churches have streamlined the entry and exit of devotees and general public for masses on Sunday.Separate gatesSt Mark’s Cathedral in the heart of Bengaluru has sent out messages to its congregational members about the security measures. “Three gates have been created for the entry and exit of people. All members have been issued stickers for their vehicles....,” a message said. At some prominent churches, the city police have deployed forces to keep a tab on the movement of public.The churches have appealed to devotees not to bring any metal objects. Frisking will be done if necessary. Cabs and autos have been banned from entering the premises. Backpacks and large bags are also banned inside the churches. A few churches have also formed volunteer groups to keep a vigil during service hours.A Presbyter with a prominent church in CBD area told DH that besides the Divine Mercy Sunday mass, special services and prayers are being organised in memory of those who died in Lanka blasts.A senior police officer attached with the Central Division told DH that they have visited a couple of churches and analysed the security arrangements. “We have directed all churches to install CCTV cameras at all vantage positions. We have tested them for quality of pictures,” he said.As the Sunday service will draw thousands of devotees, police personnel will constantly patrol those areas.The police have also asked community members to employ private security guards for frisking and checking vehicles and baggage. The police have also asked the members to be alert and inform about any suspicious activities to the police control room.	Security beefed up,Sri lanka blasts,Churches,	 Apr 28 2019
Laser therapy for animals offers faster healing	Animals treated at the Government Veterinary College will soon have a better chance at early recovery with the addition of new technology.A laser treatment centre was inaugurated on Saturday as part of the World Veterinary Day celebrations in Bengaluru. World Veterinary Day is observed in the last week of April.Speaking to DH, professor H A Upendra, head, department of medicine, said with the new facility, several animals would benefit from early healing.“Laser therapy is known to help cattle, goats, sheep and dogs. It can treat animals with arthritis, chronic wounds, mastitis, leg injuries, especially in goats. There are several wounds that do not heal. Pets with such injuries will benefit. It is also used for skin treatment,” he said.This would benefit animals with joint pain as well, much effective than conventional methods.The instrument costs about Rs 15 lakh and was donated as part of the CSR initiative by LabIndia Healthcare. “We provided them with infrastructure and they gave us equipment,” Upendra said.It was inaugurated by professor H D Narayana Swamy, vice-chancellor of Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University.The hospital sees about 160-170 cases everyday. According to Upendra, at least 20 of these cases could benefit from the new tech.As part of Veterinary Day, free immunisation is being offered to cats and dogs. On Saturday, about 100 were immunised.He added that there are a few surgeries that would be offered free of cost if the caretakers register in advance.

HC orders deportation of Pak couple	The high court on Friday ordered the immediate deportation of a Pakistani couple convicted for illegally staying in India.It directed the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Foreigners Regional Registration Office to initiate necessary steps to complete the process of deporting Kashif Shamsuddin and Kiran Ghulam Ali before May 5.Hearing the petitions filed by the couple who hail from Chakraphot in Karachi district of Pakistan, Justice Aravind Kumar ordered: “There shall not be any delay in their deportation. The couple must immediately be taken to the Wagah border and deported to Pakistan.”Even though Additional Solicitor General Prabhuling K Navadgi requested the court to grant a few days’ time as they have been waiting for confirmation from the Pakistan High Commission about the couple’s background, the court refused the request.The judge said allowing the couple to stay either in jail or outside would not only be a burden on the state’s exchequer but also amount to putting a premium on their illegal stay.Sources said the couple had been living in Bengaluru at a rented house in Kumaraswamy Layout since 2016, had obtained an Aadhaar card and were working at a local firm. They were identified by the Kumaraswamy Layout and Banashankari police and booked under the IPC as well as the Foreigners Act and the Passports Act.	Karnataka High Court,Deportation,	 Apr 27 2019
‘Avengers: Endgame’ opens to packed theatres	Even before the highly anticipated Avengers: Endgame hit the screens on April 26, it had broken the record for the highest-ever advance ticket sales for a Hollywood film so far on the online portal, BookMyShow.With 18 tickets sold per second, the total recorded sale was a whopping 2.5 million. But thousands struggled to arrange tickets for the weekend or on the release day.Sources said the tickets transferred hands with jacked up prices in black with fans, eager to watch the first day’s show, voicing no protest. Marvel brought their decade-long series to an end with the final sequel, Endgame, and fans were ecstatic about it.So unprecedented are the hype and frenzy around this movie that the law has made an exception and allowed multiplexes to screen it round-the-clock, giving loyal fans a chance to watch the early show.Shaun Joe, a student of Christ University, was eagerly awaited the 6 am first day, first show. “It was one of the best culmination of MCU movies. It was a little difficult to arrange the tickets, but, trust me, it was worth it. It’s amazing how they paved the way for the climax, along with all the logical explanations that were necessary,” he told DH.Exceeded expectationsEnthusiastic fans walking out of movie theatres were in full praise of the fine cinematography and decade-long climax. Their reactions reveal that this movie has surely exceeded every Marvelite’s expectations.“It’s the end of an amazing journey, the ultimatum to all the evil. It, kind of, turned out to be one of the greatest treats to anyone who has been following Marvel throughout,” said Abhishek Chowdhary, a student of CMS.The movie has emerged as a must-watch across the city, with theatres running packed shows.“The movie was a perfect blend, where the characters had reclassified introduction. The fight scenes were jaw-dropping, along with an on-point storyline and cinematography. This is the sole reason why I would recommend more people to watch it,” claimed Shree Krishnadeva, a Marvel fan for over 10 years.	Movie,Bengaluru,	 Apr 26 2019

‘Important to know how to cover news’	While freedom of the press is important, media personnel should follow a set of principles, Sanjoy Hazarika, Director of Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), said.Speaking about ‘Rights of Media: Increasing pressure on free media’ on Thursday, he said four journalists had been killed in the past four years. While some were shot dead, others were kidnapped and killed.Calling the deceased journalists martyrs he said they were exercising their duty under Article 19 that ensures freedom of expression.India ranks 140 of the 180 countries listed in the World Press Freedom Index. The top two countries are Norway and Finland while India is ranked lower than the UAE and Jamaica.Hazarika pointed out that most organisations have human rights policies for salaries and leave. But they should have one for internal governance and women’s security also. Due to the lack of safety in workspaces, there is a drop in the number of working women over the past 10 years.Similarly, there should also be an external policy for coverage. Apart from knowing what to cover and not, it is important to know how to cover an issue, he said adding that the civil society should look at media as its partner in disseminating information and not as its consumer.Instead of covering news, media men are becoming the news. Truth is a powerful tool and media should be clear on it. The media has a duty to reflect facts in all diversity.	Sanjoy Hazarika,	 Apr 26 2019
HC serves notices to state, KSPCB	The high court issued notices to the state, KSPCB, a taxi drivers’ union, Uber India and Ola while hearing a petition challenging the grant of auto permits.Fresh permits would be subject to the result of the writ petition, the court said. The court was hearing a petition by Nithin Puthige, a software professional, who challenged the transport department’s notification enhancing the ceiling of auto permits from 1.25 lakh to 1.5 lakh. Puthige contended that in 2013, the HC, alarmed by the increase in city noise pollution, initiated suo moto proceedings. The court’s direction was not taken to a logical end, he contended.The petitioner sought directions to protect the environment and to fix a ceiling by considering the traffic density of the city.

Undergrad BU students must study environmental science	From the next academic year, 2019-20, the undergraduate students at the Bangalore University (BU) and its affiliated colleges will compulsorily read environmental science, irrespective of their streams.The move from the varsity comes as climate change and other allied environmental challenges loom.Environmental studies will carry 70 marks for theory and 30 marks in internal assessment.“It has been decided to introduce the subject compulsorily across all streams. Graduates should be aware of their role in protecting the environment. A few autonomous colleges have already made environmental studies mandatory. Curriculum for the same has already been designed. We are yet to finalise in which semester the various streams can introduce the subject,” a senior BU official told DH.In order to spur further interest among students, the BU has decided to keep multiple choice questions in English and Kannada for environmental studies. Curriculum would include theory classes and practicals to give students a first-hand experience of the field activities. BU has also decided to lend their campus to other affiliated colleges, deprived of lung spaces.However, the managements of a few degree colleges are crying foul over the move. Requesting anonymity, the principal of a BU affiliated college said having a separate faculty for the subject is not required.“As part of social responsibility, we are conducting various eco-friendly events through NCC and NSS. Also, our students took part in eco-friendly events to mark the Environment Day and Earth Day. So, I don’t think compulsory environmental studies at the college level is justified,” she told DH.

Planetarium decked up for Zero Shadow Day	The Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium is decked up to attract students and astronomy enthusiasts for ‘Zero Shadow Day’ on Wednesday.On this day, the sun will be at the zenith of Bengaluru, as a consequence of which it will cast no shadow.According to officials at the planetarium, at around 12:17 pm, the city will be a no-shadow zone. “This celestial phenomenon can only be observed twice a year. The first time, it can be observed when the sun traces a path towards the northernmost point at the Tropic of Cancer, or what is called the Summer Solstice. On its way towards the northern point, the sun passes directly over the zenith of Bengaluru. The sun then retraces its path towards the south, and the zero shadow phenomenon is yet again observable as the sun’s path passes over Bengaluru for the second time,” said a technical officer.The expert staffers have organised a day-long workshop from 10:30 am to 3:30 pm which can be attended by students of class 8 and above.“We had about 50 students for the workshop and about 400 people who came to the planetarium to observe the Zero Shadow Days last year. We have also done various trial runs to ensure that everything goes smoothly,” said Pramod Galgali, the Director of JN Planetarium.Galgali hopes that more people turn up this year to observe the phenomenon.

Akin to their masters, pets prone to lifestyle ailments	Three-year-old Blessy is obese and diabetic. Thanks to the Labrador Retriever’s sedentary lifestyle, she is likely to suffer from arthritis as well.Blessy is one of the many pet dogs in the city vulnerable to a host of lifestyle diseases owing to lack of exercise, restricted movement and imbalanced diet.According to city-based vets, dogs mainly suffer from obesity, arthritis, diabetes, and cardiac problems among a host of other ailments, leading to a reduced life span. “Obesity is the most common. Approximately, one in three dogs are overweight. Obesity also leads to various other diseases like arthritis, diabetes, kidney ailments and cancer,” says Dr Srikanth B V, a veterinarian, who runs the Prakruthi Vet Hospital at Banashankari.Dr Srikanth further points out that rapid urbanisation and the apartment culture has led to a decrease in open spaces and parks in the city. As a result, owners are unable to walk their pets.” He also blames erratic feeding and pampering.

Thanks to the Labrador Retriever’s sedentary lifestyle, she is likely to suffer from arthritis as well.
Blessy is one of the many pet dogs in the city vulnerable to a host of lifestyle diseases owing to lack of exercise, restricted movement and imbalanced diet.
According to city-based vets, dogs mainly suffer from obesity, arthritis, diabetes, and cardiac problems among a host of other ailments, leading to a reduced life span. 
“Obesity is the most common. Approximately, one in three dogs are overweight. Obesity also leads to various other diseases like arthritis, diabetes, kidney ailments and cancer,” says Dr Srikanth B V, a veterinarian, who runs the Prakruthi Vet Hospital at Banashankari.
Dr Srikanth further points out that rapid urbanisation and the apartment culture has led to a decrease in open spaces and parks in the city. As a result, owners are unable to walk their pets.” He also blames erratic feeding and pampering.

Dumped after black magic, injured slender loris rescued	Staffers of the Press Club of Bangalore in Cubbon Park rescued a sub-adult and badly injured slender loris during their morning walk on Sunday. Surrounded by stray dogs and crows, the nocturnal animal was found writhing in pain. The staffers contacted the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Wildlife Rehabilitation and Rescue Centre in Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP). Rescuers told DH that the animal had severe injuries on all its paws, a clear indication that it was tied up. “This is only done when the animal is used for black magic. It is severely malnourished and has injury marks on its body,” a rescuer said. WRRC volunteer M N Simhadri said people, unfortunately, continue to indulge in black magic using animals even in a cosmopolitan city like Bengaluru. This is the year’s first case of a slender loris being rescued in Cubbon, from where they have virtually disappeared due to habitat changes. The nocturnal animals were once a common feature in the city’s prime lung space where they have not been sighted for the past two years. But the person who threw away the animal at the park was unaware of its disappearance from the green space.Slender lorises are used for black magic due to their big, bright eyes, though their use in black magic rituals is based on myths. In reality, the animals are harmless and shy. They are now found in pockets of the IISc campus, Sankey tank, Lalbagh, GKVK-Hebbal, Bellandur, Turahalli, Bannerghatta and the Bangalore University campus.Forest and BBMP officials have urged the citizens to inform them when they find injured animals in the city.

Teen YouTuber lures thousands to millets	When his mother was diagnosed with diabetes in 2017, Arka Pudota did what every 15-year-old would do: scour the internet for healthier recipes. Barring a few conventional millet-based dishes, there was not much of anything. Not the one to give up, Pudota experimented with conventional recipes and came up with much tastier dishes, which he began sharing on his YouTube channel ‘Millet Mantra’. Now he is a rising star among the city YouTubers. Be it Jowar Methi balls, Foxtail millet coconut rice, Ragi/Finger Millet Vermicelli Upma or Ragi Paneer Paniyaram, Pudota blends the mouthwatering effect of the dishes with the nutritious value to educate his 2,000 YouTube subscribers and 7,000 Facebook followers. The channel is also turning out to be one of the best sources on millet varieties and their health benefits. “I’ve got feedback on how my channel helped people. Some shared their most interesting recipes, while a few reached out to learn more about millets,” the teenager said. His brother Arya’s channel on organic farming was an additional impetus to choose YouTube. “His videos sensitised me to problems of the farmers who see no demand for millets. I encourage people to make millet a part of their diet and create a demand,” Pudota said.“Smaller portions of millet dishes make you full. That’s why they’re great substitutes for rice, which we need to eat more to feel satiated. Millets are also more nutritious,” said the teen. Millets also benefit farmers as they are not water-intensive and are best suited for arid regions.	Recipes,YouTube,Millet,	 Apr 20 2019
Scouts help seniors, differently abled to vote	"Some polling booths in Bengaluru were inaccessible for voters with disability and seniors.Elderly voters were made to walk up 2-3 floors to cast their votes and the ramps set up proved to be inadequate.At the Government Primary School behind Hoskerehalli bus stand, a bunch of scouts carried the wheelchair-bound elders and people with disability to the second-floor polling station. Voters relied on the 10 or 15 scouts since the ramp set up here was uneven.“We’re doing our bit for the nation. We’re still not eligible to vote and the least we could do is to assist the voters. We noticed the plight of the voters last time and decided to help,” Sanjeev, a member of the scout team, told DH.Some voters were furious that the EC did not set up the facilities properly to allow them to reach the booth unaided. Nagaraj Nayak (89) made no secret of his feelings. “Polling booths should be on the ground floor and should be easily accessible. We’re thankful to these kids, but the EC should take notice and correct this next time,” he said. The scene was no different at another booth in Uttarahalli, where the NCC cadets carried the elders and those with disability.The government school in Vasanthpur had the polling station on the first floor, making it difficult for the seniors to reach.Paralysed man carried to polling boothA 52-year-old paralysed man did not allow his challenge to stop him from exercising his democratic right on Thursday.Ajaz Ahmed, who suffers from a host of health issues that includes kidney problems, diabetes and blood pressure was carried to a polling booth to vote by his family members to cast his vote.Speaking about his commitment to vote, Aejaz Baig, Ahmed's brother-in-law says "" He got up early in the morning and was geared up to cast his vote . He kept pushing us to take him to the voting booth. He has never stepped back from voting as he believes that one must vote without fail as a proud citizen of India.""He also adds that Ahmed's failing health has never stopped him from performing his duties and he is an inspiration to his family.On Thursday Ahmed arrived in an auto from which he was carried by four of his family members to a polling booth in Chikkabasavanapura in K R puram constituency to cast his vote. Ahmed is married with two young children."	Senior citizens,Lok Sabha Polls 2019,disabled,polling booth,General Elections 2019,	 Apr 19 2019
Grateful driver ferries candidate to booth	A 60-year-old woman auto driver who received the vehicle as a gift from Rizwan Arshad gratefully ferried the Congress-JD(S) joint candidate for Bangalore Central Lok Sabha constituency to the polling booth. Arshad gifted the autorickshaw two months ago.Shanta waited for an opportunity to express her gratitude for what Arshad did and the opportunity presented itself on the morning of the polling day, when she picked him up from his residence and rode him to the United Theological College in Millers Road (Bangalore Central Constituency).“I like him not just because he helped me earn my livelihood, but also because he looks like Rajiv Gandhi,” Shanta said. “I asked one of the media persons to let him know that I’d like him to take a ride in my auto one day. The media person helped me talk to him after which Rizwan spoke to me. I’ve been requesting him for the past three months, but he finally took a ride.”Rizwan, who rode with his wife to the polling station, said Shanta is a good friend. “She has been asking me to hitch a ride for the past three months and I didn’t want to deny her wish,” he said.

Senior citizens turn nostalgic about old times	"When G Nanjappa cast his first vote, he wrote the candidate's number on a paper and dropped it in a box. Today, the 89-year-old's constituency has a VVPAT.DH spoke to senior citizens to draw a comparison between their first election and now.""I have lived here since I was five and have come to the same booth ever since,"" Nanjappa told DH.Now, it is the third generation of voters in his family. ""I have not missed an election. I encourage youngsters to vote. All they need is an identity proof,"" he added.A retired transport inspector, Nanjappa recollects booth 49, where he voted on Thursday, as a place that wasn't easily accessible. ""As I was the inspector, I requested at least one bus,"" he remembered.Over the years, the process has become easier, felt Nanjappa. ""Even candidates are better now,"" he said. Nanjappa's wife who is 83, was accompanied by her grandson.Lakshmamma (67) and her two daughters cast votes at Govindarajnagar in Bengaluru South.""I first voted when Indira Gandhi first came to power. Back then, I was given Rs 300. In fact, we weren't aware who sent the money. Now, the situation is different,"" she recollected. Today, Lakshmamma lives on a meagre Rs 1,000 pension.A few senior citizens believe nothing changed over the years and promises by candidates remain on paper. 76-year-old Lakshmi Bai believes otherwise.Over the years, candidates have turned more responsible and work better, she thinks. Jayakakshmi recalls when campaigns involved megaphones, roadshows and groups knocking on doors seeking votes.Senior citizens believe the focus has now shifted to social media and smartphones. Campaigns on Facebook, WhatsApp and such, overpower real-time campaigning, they say."	General Elections 2019,Senior citizens,Lok Sabha Polls 2019,	 Apr 19 2019
Junk food, not alcohol, causing fatty liver	"Even if you have never touched alcohol, you can still get liver cirrhosis. A new study in the UK has found that a large number of teenagers and young adults have Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver (NAFL). A Bengaluru-based gastroenterologist sees five patients in the 16-20 age group with NAFL in a month, underscoring the prevalence of the condition closer home. ""Eating junk food, cheese, drinking carbonated drinks and not exercising much cause NAFL in the long run,"" said Dr M S Sandeep, a gastroenterologist at Apollo Hospitals. According to him, the profile of people with fatty liver has changed from alcoholics to consumers of processed food in the last five years. The liver bears lots of abuse and allows the patient to lead a normal life until it is 70% damaged.""It takes decades for someone to develop the liver disease,"" Dr Sandeep said. ""When it's diagnosed, a lot of time is lost. Though there are medication and lifestyle changes, you can't actually cure fatty liver."" Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is the result of fat build-up in the liver and is more serious among fatty liver diseases. If you have NASH, you have inflammation and liver cell damage, along with fat in your liver. Surprisingly, women in their late teens and early 20s are developing liver cirrhosis. Autoimmune hepatitis, for instance, is more common among women than men and can begin at a very young age. It may cause abdominal pain, jaundice, fatigue, weight loss and disabling joint pain. If left untreated or undiagnosed, autoimmune hepatitis can develop into cirrhosis."	Junk food,fatty liver,Alcohol,	 Apr 18 2019
Just 20% in state have access to Hemophilia treatment	"Though treatment for haemophilia is free of cost at government hospitals in Karnataka, just 20% of individuals suffering from the condition have access to it. According to Vikash Goel, president, Hemophilia Federation (India), a large population is still undiagnosed, leading to complications and untimely deaths. ""Even the medical fraternity is not aware of haemophilia and its diagnosis, especially in rural areas,"" adds Goel. In Karnataka, the treatment for haemophilia was regularised in 2017. About 2,645 patients are treated free of charge in government hospitals at a cost of Rs 15 crore per year. Dr Swatantra Banakar, deputy director, blood safety, Health and Family Welfare Service, says the number of patients is increasing every year. ""The treatment is for life where blood factors are given in the form of injections. The drugs are mainly imported, procured through tenders,"" he adds. According to Dr Cecil Ross, a haematologist at St John's hospital, early diagnosis and access to treatment are giving children a near normal childhood. ""Proper physiotherapy plays an important part in ensuring that they remain active and healthy. The current standard is to treat all children with regular replacement therapy — prophylactic infusions of clotting factor concentrates to prevent bleeding,"" he says.There is a need to create awareness about haemophilia through education, knowledge sharing and information exchanges, says Dr Anoop P, senior consultant in haematology and pediatric hemato-oncology, Apollo Hospitals. ""If haemophilia is not diagnosed early, the repeated bleeding into joints, bones and muscles may lead to synovitis, arthritis and permanent joint deformities. The bleeding itself can lead to wasting and atrophy of muscles,"" he points out.What is haemophilia?Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder where the person suffers from defective clotting protein and requires external blood factors to avoid bleeding in case of an injury. Based on the clotting factor the disease is categorised into haemophilia A and haemophilia B. Patients with severe haemophilia A constitute nearly 70% of the sufferers. It occurs in one in 5,000 males while haemophilia B is seen in one in 20,000. Though considered an inherited disease, around 30% of patients do not have any history of family members with haemophilia, making it very difficult to identify the condition."	treatment,Hemophilia,	 Apr 17 2019
New authors aim for bestsellers despite 95% rejections	Inspired by the meteoric success of established Indian writers, legions of new authors are trying to make it big in the face of rejection rates of 95% and little monetary gain.Samhita Arni, a New York Times-bestselling author known for adapting Indian epic poems into modern narratives, and who also teaches a creative writing class at a university in the city, revealed that the royalties from her bestselling books can barely cover half of the rental costs on her apartment here. Her rent is Rs 20,000.“We have so many young students in our creative writing programme that I wonder how they will make it in this country where it is difficult to be a full-time writer,” Samhita said, adding that Indian authors have little access to grants and other financial support that authors in the West enjoy.According to data provided by Penguin Books, Random House and Simon & Schuster Publishing, the number of books being published in India is growing at a rate of 15%. Simon & Schuster, which often fields 15 books a month, aspires to sell at least 4,000 copies every month. The average book in India sells only 50 copies.“In India, the minimum sale number required for a book to be classified as a bestseller is 2,000 copies,” said Madhukar Raj, who wrote Hack the Job (2018), a guide which aspires to offer advice on staying relevant in the age of automation.Raj, who said he quit his job as a software engineer to become an author, took almost two years to write the book, during which he expended his life savings within a year and was forced to rely on funding from relatives to continue. “The book was eventually published, but I could not think of becoming a full-time writer in order to support myself because the royalties would never allow me to make a proper living. Now, I am looking to get back into software.” According to figures released by the publishing industry, 82,000 books are released every year in India.	Bengaluru,literature,	 Apr 16 2019

Assamese create a piece of home in city for Bihu	"The city’s Assamese community, including several young IT professionals on Saturday converged at the Freedom International School playground in HSR Layout to celebrate the spring festival of ‘Bohang Bihu’.With the Assam Society of Bangalore (ASOB) rolling out the 20th edition of its spring festival this month, the community marked Bohang Bihu or Rongali Bihu with a dazzling array of dances and cuisine from the ‘Seven Sister’ states of Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim and Assam.Tunes from the traditional folk instruments and a concert by singer-composer Zubeen Garg left many with memories of home.While 30 performers presented the Husori dance on one side, participants of the Bihu kuwori competition busied themselves amid those checking out the traditional mekhela savor and gohona on display at the flea market, even as the aroma of northeastern food wafted in from the 15 eateries that did busy business.Avoiding an arduous journey home for the festival season, nearly 3,000 Assamese from across South India made it to the ground here. “We certainly miss the festival back home,” said Shanthi Tummala who lives in Shivajinagar. “But the celebration here fills our hearts with joy.” Over the past five years of her stay in Bengaluru, Shanthi could go home for the festival only twice. “This is my third new year in the city.

A morning feast for astronomy enthusiasts	It was an unusual sight at the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium on T Chowdiah Road early morning Saturday. As Bengalureans were deep asleep, more than 100 astronomy enthusiasts and kids flocked to the planetarium to catch a glimpse of various planets of the solar system.What initially began as a small event at 4.00 am, soon turned into something big, with several people along with their kids descending on the planetarium for the ‘Sky Watch’ programme organised by the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium along with the Association of Bangalore Amateur Astronomers (ABAA). As the event coincided with the summer holidays, kids turned up in big numbers for the event. Speaking to DH, Pramod Galgali, Director of the Planetarium, said, “The event was organised as Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn are visible in the morning sky. Though it is possible to see these planets during the day, they can be best seen during the morning sky. Hence the event was organised early in the morning from 4.00 am till the sunrise.”The free event was attended by several astronomy enthusiasts and students. Vikas, a student from Vasanth Nagar, said he was “thrilled” to see the planets for the first time.“Even though I had seen them in television documentaries, watching them through the telescope was indeed a different experience. I enjoyed the programme besides getting to know some unknown facts about sky watching,” he said.The different telescopes for public viewing were arranged by the members of the ABAA. The organisers were hopeful that the event will attract more visitors.“A few months ago, we had organised a similar event and it was attended by a huge crowd,” Galgali said.

Don’t buy, just try: Gadgets, toys go rental way	Ever tried aqua aerobics with water dumbbells or toyed around with a cozmo interactive robot? Worn an Oculus VR headset? But why buy such fancy, expensive stuff when you can actually rent them for a day or two, the items of choice home-delivered for a price?This is precisely what a Bengaluru-based startup, Yopik.in, has to offer for experience-hunters, who would rather try than buy.Launched in December 2018, the platform has added over 100 rental items across 11 categories.Most customers rent out stuff just for a day, informs Yopik founder Ojas Parikh. “People want to try out modern equipment, which they would otherwise not buy. For instance, we have this golf-swing analyser that many feel pointless to buy. But they would rent it since everyone is in a rush to experience new things,” Parikh explains.Homemaker Minal Sanghvi had seen her five-year-old son’s fascination for electronic toys. But she knew that fascination was a passing phase, and spending thousands would be a waste.She chose to rent out the Cozmo robot instead. “Imagine his joy when we got home the high-end robot that plays with you, learns from you, reacts and becomes your buddy. No, we didn’t buy this set worth Rs 10,000, but just rented it out for the weekend,” she recalls.Parikh used his Amazon experience to merge e-commerce’s ease of delivery and transaction with the rental services. “Majority of products we offer have been bought by us from across the world, giving us total control over their availability, quality and condition.” To ensure the rented products are returned in good condition, a security deposit is levied. This is refunded once the product is returned and checked.Once a particular product booked online, a confirmation and status of the order is sent to the customer. The platform’s delivery personnel take it to the customer’s home and demonstrates how the product works.Before taking a rental decision, the customer could also check a product demo video and usage manuals online.DH News Service	gadgets,Rental,	 Apr 13 2019
Summer camps get 21st-century makeover	Organisers of summer camps are abandoning traditional activities like cooking and craft, offering in their place app building and entrepreneurship for students eager to learn the 21st century skills.Parents, on the other hand, like to sign their wards up for courses on manners and etiquette, while a few also groom them on how to conduct themselves in public.Many such courses are designed for children aged 5 to 10 and are offered for the first time. Not so surprisingly, parents queue up in large numbers to find a place for their wards.“I was searching for a different summer camp and came across the Android app building,” said Chetan L, father of a nine-year-old boy passionate about technology and aerodynamics.Poorvi M, who signed her daughter up in a course on manners, found the offering “different” from other programmes. “There’s no harm if children learn more,” she added.Ashwin Yadiyala S, Managing Trustee, Sparrows Group of Education, introduced the course on manners and etiquette for the first time. “It’s important that they learn discipline. It’s also important that they recognize and respect other people, something that should be taught at an early age,” he said.Since both their parents are busy working, they spend very little time with their wards, resulting in children learning less manners and etiquette from them. “We teach them how to greet and behave with others in social gathering,” Yadiyala said.Narasimha Naidu, a STEM educator from EduTech Stem Studio, said courses are designed on 21st-century technology skills. Students are trained on engineering and science education platforms.Besides, students between ages 8 and 14 show a greater level of interest in courses on mentorship, budget planning, marketing management, entrepreneurship and partnership firms. Some are fascinated about setting up farm-centric businesses like beekeeping and mushroom farming.	summer,Summer camp,	 Apr 08 2019
Sparrow workshop draws young and old alike	Bengalureans usually spend their Sundays lazing around but some dedicated the day to learning about their friendly neighbour, the house sparrow, and how to bring it back to the city. A group of 100 people, along with children, took part in ‘Bringing Back Sparrows’, a bird’s nest-building workshop organised by Ragi Kana, a hub of cultural activities along Bannerghatta Road in southern Bengaluru.The workshop was facilitated by J N Prasad, a bird watcher from Hakki Goodu. The participants not only learnt the reasons for the dwindling population of sparrows, which were once found in abundance in the city, but also how to create bird’s nests using things commonly found in homes to give sparrows a comfortable, yet safe space, such as shoe boxes and reusable materials. For many, especially children, learning about sparrows and working on creating their nests was an eye-opening experience. Arun Kumar, a volunteer from Ragi Kana, said they had been conducting workshops on different themes every Sunday to bridge the gap between rural producers (farmers) and urban consumers.Weekly marketThe other objective is to create awareness about social and environmental issues. They also set up a weekly market to help people buy groceries, vegetables and handlooms directly from farmers. The workshop on sparrows was the 98th such event organised by Ragi Kana.	sparrows,	 Apr 08 2019
Pvt bus operators make hay while festive sun shines	Fares of most of the private buses shot up on Friday night due to festive rush, as people made all efforts to reach their hometowns. Most of the operators stuck to the 50% hike - the limit set by the State Transport Authority (STA), though some charge more.Last month, the STA called a meeting of private bus operators and warned them against hiking the rates beyond 50% of the normal fares. The instruction was given following complaints by the public that they are forced to pay a bomb during weekend rush and festive season.However, unlike the KSRTC, private buses do not have a base fare. Officials said some private operators were using this loophole in the STA’s argument to charge more than 100%.On the Bengaluru-Hubballi route, the normal fare for non-AC sleeper bus went up from the range of Rs 800-900 to Rs 1,100-1,400. On the Mangaluru route, a leading operator charged Rs 3,000 for a seat, which usually costs less than Rs 1,000.A senior official from the regional transport office (RTO) said they were monitoring the fares for violation of the direction. When asked about the Rs 3000 ticket for Mangaluru, he said RTO inspectors were trying to book the ticket, which will be used as evidence for action against the operators.“We are also trying to book tickets online through app and web interface of some operators and aggregators. Buses charging high fares will be penalised,” the official added.The state government has been sitting on a proposal by the RTO to fix minimum and maximum fare per kilometre for buses running on contract carriage permit (running from point A to B without stops). The existing fare rules apply only for buses running on stage carriage permit (operating like city transport with multiple stops).Last week, Transport Commissioner V P Ikkeri said the subject will be taken up after the elections.

The police also said that the owner of the building had provided shelter to Mallappa’s family.	K R Puram,Drowning,	 Mar 29 2019
NLSIU professor frames draft law on water management	Professors from National Law School India University (NLSIU) have prepared a comprehensive law on water management that proposes to have all departments concerning with water under one umbrella of law, implement and follow it.Agriculture minister N H Shivashankara Reddy in December 2018 had approached Dr M K Ramesh, professor of law, NLSIU, and his team, to prepare a thorough law to include all aspects of water and its protection. Accordingly, the law professor and his team have come up with a draft law.According to Dr Ramesh, till date, no states have come up with any comprehensive law on water except Rajasthan that had a law with some inputs from the law university.“A law on water would bring all the stakeholders, i.e. the departments, under one umbrella of law to follow one set of rules. As far as Bengaluru is concerned, there is already an uneven distribution of water to the city dwellers. Incorporating water law and enforcing it would help everyone to get equal water supply,” he said.Explaining about people-centric initiatives and traditions like Jal Biradari in Rajasthan and Pani Panchayat in Maharashtra, which have demonstrated enduring value of traditional wisdom and communitarian contributions to good water governance, Dr Ramesh said these traditional water conservators should be recognised and accommodated into the system of water governance in the state of their origin.“There are traditional conservators even in Karnataka. It is just a matter of time for the government to identify them and their contribution,” he added.The objective of the law** Legal empowerment of water users by crystallisation of their rights and securing them.** Accommodation and adoption of good traditions and best-practices in water resource management by communities.** Developing linkages and strengthening the bonds of the relation between water users, line agencies, statutory bodies and constitutional institutions and evolving mechanisms for their coordinated and harmonious functioning.** Law for conservation, protection, equitable and efficient use and to safeguard water, food and ecological security and sustainability.** Law to converge, consolidate and harmonise all existing laws and institutions of enforcement.** Guiding principles, the doctrine of public trust, equity, sustainable use and conservation.** Top priority to human and ecological needs.** Community participation, restoration, efficient, equitable, beneficial and optimal use-strategies of governance.

The court was hearing a petition filed by Jitendra Kumar Rajan, a computer science student at Khaja Bandanawaz College of Engineering (KBN), who had moved the court seeking directions to the university to declare his results. A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy disposed of all the applications filed by the student after hearing them.The nightmareJitendra Kumar Rajan, a resident of Karkala, Udupi district, got admitted to KBN College in 2005. His ordeal began in 2008 when he was not issued a hall ticket to take the exams. In 2009, he was forced to take readmission as the university did not announce the result of exams conducted in June 2009. In 2012, his first- and second-semester results were not announced following which he filed his first petition. His ordeal continued with the university not declaring his results but permitting him to appear for the examinations.

Residents pay a bomb to get rid of monkeys	"The loss of green cover, the mushrooming of apartment complexes and the growing piles of garbage have compounded the monkey menace in the city, especially on the outskirts. Now, it’s a double whammy for citizens. They have to pay a bomb to get rid of the animals. Apartment associations are being asked to pay anything between Rs 65,000 and Rs 1 lakh for the capture and release of monkeys to conducive habitats. “Monkeys raid our place every day. They rummage through garbage buckets, snatch lunch boxes from children and even enter our homes. We approached the Karnataka Forest Department, which routed us to monkey catchers, who in turn demanded Rs 1 lakh. The relief lasted just a week... the monkeys returned,” said Dinesh, a resident of an apartment complex in Vidyaranyapura.Sujatha from Sarjapura Road had a similar experience. “Initially, the rescuer demanded Rs 1 lakh. He claimed to be an expert from Maharashtra. When we tried to buy time, he brought the fee down to Rs 85,000. Monkeys have attacked children and women,” she said.Some apartment complexes are using firecrackers to drive away monkeys. This “special” duty is entrusted with the security guards.Karnataka Forest Department officials said that it was up to the apartment owner and animal rescuer to fix the cost. The department has only given permission to catch monkeys and release them into conducive habitats under Section 11(1-A) of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, said R Gokul, Chief Conservator of Forests, Bengaluru.“People approach us, saying there is a threat to children and that properties are being damaged. Appropriate directions have been issued to the deputy conservator of forests. Unlike rural areas, monkeys face no threat from predators like leopards in the city. Food is also in abundance. They are unable to move around, as there are no vast spaces in the city. Thus, the menace is increasing,” Gokul said.Forest Department and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials cite garbage mismanagement. “Since citizens are not managing their garbage, monkeys and street dogs are thriving,” said a BBMP official.However, urban conservationists are divided on whether to capture the simians or let them be. Fruit trees to feed monkeysThe Forest Department has come up with some novel initiatives to address the monkey menace in urban spaces. It plans to plant as many fruit trees as possible in the forest areas surrounding Bengaluru. The decision has already been implemented at the Jarakbande Kaval forest area near Yelahanka where the department officials have taken up planting of native species, especially fruit-bearing trees, on close to 50 acres. Speaking to DH, a senior official of the Bengaluru Urban forest department said, ""Currently, most of the forest patches around Bengaluru have eucalyptus trees. But ever since the government banned these trees, we have been clearing them in a phased manner as and when the plantation is ready for harvest. Soon after clearing these trees, we are planting native species, including fruit varieties like mango, tamarind, jamun and ficus species, so that they provide food for the monkeys. This has begun at Jarakbande Kaval,"" the official said.It is the lack of food in the forest that has prompted the primates to stray into human habitations, the official observed."

Man killed in high-speed Range Rover test drive	An accident during a high-speed test drive of a Rs 65-lakh Range Rover Evoque claimed the life of a 31-year-old businessman and left his wife with a fractured spine.The deceased, Sagar Jayaram, an interior decorator, was a resident of Girinagar. Sagar’s wife Sandhya (27) sustained a fracture in her spine and is admitted to the BGS Global Hospital off Uttarahalli Main Road near Kengeri.Sagar’s son Samarth (6), and his friend and business partner Gowtham, and the demo driver Shivakumar escaped unhurt in the accident near Hoskerehalli toll booth on NICE Road, in west Bengaluru on Tuesday afternoon.Sagar planned to buy a Range Rover and had booked a trial drive on Tuesday from a Jaguar showroom in Rupena Agrahara on Hosur Road. The five of them, including demo driver Shivakumar, took the NICE Road for the demo and were headed towards their home in Girinagar around 2.35 pm.“It happened in a couple of seconds,” said a toll booth staffer. The car was travelling at a speed of at least 150 to 180 kmph. It looked like the driver lost control and avoided hitting the toll booths, the police said. There were no tyre marks on the road to indicate braking, said a police officer at the spot. The car initially hit one of the extreme left dividers meant to segregate vehicles.It then hit the guard rails, and ploughed through a fence and fell 10 to 12 metres down an embankment. The toll booth staff and other motorists rushed to the victims’ help and tried to extricate them from the car fearing it could catch fire.The police rushed to the spot and shifted the victims to BGS Global Hospital. Prima facie it looks like Sagar was driving the car with the demo driver Shivakumar in the passenger’s seat. The car flipped over several times and Sagar was found bleeding from his face and ears. The driver and the co-passenger were wearing seat belts and the air-bags deployed.Sagar was declared brought dead at the hospital after which his body was shifted to Victoria Hospital for postmortem.Sagar’s sister, who is abroad, is on her way to Bengaluru after she was informed of the accident, the police said. The Byatrayanapura traffic police have registered a case and are investigating.	Bengaluru,Car accident,	 Mar 26 2019
Realtor’s bungalow gutted in fire	A massive fire broke out at a realtor’s house in Mallarabanavadi, rural Nelamangala, on Monday. The blaze gutted the house in its entirety.

New Lalbagh shows the way, drop by drop	The whole of Karnataka is reeling under severe shortage of water, with farmers facing a bitter crisis in the wake of groundwater levels fast depleting and reservoirs drying up.But the elite coconut seed farm at Kannamangala in East Bengaluru managed by the Horticulture department — where the government is developing a new Lalbagh — has shown the state what best can be done with the little water it has.Using every drop judiciously, the farm has not only increased its coconut yield from previous years, but is also paving the way for the creation of a verdant lung space in a region where the water table has depleted beyond 1,000 to 1,500 feet. Until last year, the farm in Whitefield limits used to wilt under scorching heat. The yield dropped considerably for 30 years. But the farm has sprung to life with the announcement of creation of a new Lalbagh in the area.Rudresh, the proprietor of Lalbagh, said that judicious management of water sources resulted in a 30% increase in yield. “Besides the shortage of labour, the borewells had also dried up. But our efforts to revive the farm by providing nutrient inputs and judicious management of water sources resulted in a good yield. Each palm is giving us about 80 to 100 coconuts a year,” Rudresh said.The 152-acre coconut farm has about 3,500 palms of different varieties.The officials and labourers recharged the dried up borewells and also switched over to sprinkler system of irrigation. It saved a lot of water, which will be used to raise fresh saplings.“As the new Lalbagh is taking shape, it requires even more water in the days to come. Hence we have linked with surrounding industries and residential layouts to source treated water for the garden maintenance. We have plans of raising mixed cropping, multi-tier cropping, inter-cropping and border cropping plantation with a variety of palms and other flora and thereby creating the largest lung space in the region,” a senior horticulture official revealed.

Activists issue climate SOS to get political attention	The searing heat on Sunday offered an ideal condition for a group of activists gathered before the Town Hall to declare a ‘climate change emergency’.As smoke curled up from the blacktop in the 36 degrees Celsius heat, activists hoped forcing an emergency would stir a public discussion and create a list of action points for the government to address on the issue, which is threatening to cause widespread destruction.“The elections are round the corner and we wanted to do something more than just talking about the issue,” said Dr Sanjeev Kulkarni, one of the organisers of the event.“My suggestion is to gather a larger group, prepare a list of demands, keeping mother earth and climate change in mind and ask the political parties to include them in their manifestos and commit themselves to implement them,” he said. Such efforts by citizen groups may have failed to move the government, but Dr Kulkarni believed that it would be possible to extract a promise from a politician facing an election.Environmental writer Nagesh Hegde said Karnataka’s climate scene is dreadful. He agreed that protecting the environment will not be possible without educating the public, but blamed India’s growing consumerist society for damaging the ecology.“India was the model for sustainability. We had it in us not to waste food or water. But with the advent of the Western culture, we lost our way,” he said, pointing out that the idea of ‘Westernism’ is something prevalent in the country for the past 50 years.Part of Dr Kulkarni’s proposal to the government was to urge the passing of legislation mandating farmers to devote 1/3rd of their land for tree-based agriculture.“This would help regenerate and percolate the topsoil. Trees would offer biomass and fruits to the family,” he added. The activist said this could be one of the issues that the public could discuss.

Glimpse of future: Drone recharge atop streetlights	As part of the ambitious Smart Cities Mission, the researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have designed charging ports for drones atop streetlights.Battery backup is a major challenge that drones are facing at the moment. The technical team working at the Robert Bosch Centre, IISC, has addressed this problem. Now, drones can skip returning to base stations or crash landing once the batteries are drained.The innovation is the brainchild of Dr Ashish V Joglekar, a technical staff at the Robert Bosch Centre. Joglekar, along with the assistance of Vishwas Navada, designed the charging ports, which will be installed on top of streetlight poles.At the recent IISc Open Day, the team demonstrated how the system works. “When the battery is about to be exhausted, drones will search for the nearest charging port installed on streetlight poles. Drones can independently search for the nearest port using GPS and can home in,” Joglekar told DH.This will initially cater to online shopping platforms, planning to deliver merchandise using drones, where battery backup is the prime concern. A drone low on battery will complete charging within an hour.“We are working on reducing the charging time,” said Vishwas Navada adding that the facility will serve many other purposes than just product delivery.”The team is to hold talks with concerned authorities like the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and power generators bodies to bring in norms and specifications for the ports.“We are expecting norms to be passed on the mode of drone landing assistance, types of drones that can have the feature, safety and charging capability,” Joglekar further added.

Deported Kyrgyz woman sneaks in KIA	A 34-year-old woman from Kyrgyzstan, deported from India for violating visa norms, not only was caught working for the same firm here but also managed to obtain an Indian passport.Narina Dokturbekova, was arrested at the Kempegowda International Airport on March 21, while she was about to take a flight to Nepal.Dokturbekova presented her Indian passport at the immigration counter for clearance. When the immigration officials crosschecked her name in their database, they found that she also had a passport of Kyrgyzstan.She was then apprehended and questioned in detail. She had come to the city from Kyrgyzstan on a business visa, and was illegally working at the marketing division of an adhesive manufacturing company.In November 2018, the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) found her visa violations after which she was deported from the city via Delhi to her home country.However, Dokturbekova managed to sneak back into India through the porous borders along Nepal and came to Bengaluru on road, joining the same company for work. She then managed to obtain an Aadhar card and PAN card by which she applied for a passport, which was issued later. She was produced before a court and remanded in judicial custody. The BIAL police have booked Dokturbekova under appropriate sections of Foreigners Act, 1946 and Passport Act, 1967 along with cheating. Further investigations are on to ascertain how she procured other documentation.DH News Service	Kempegowda International Airport,Kyrgyzstan,	 Mar 24 2019
Students, science enthusiasts flock to IISc on Open Day	For children, Saturday did not seem like the leisurely affair as their teachers ushered them into the sprawling Indian Institute of Science (IISc) campus. The institute — the 371-acre lung space where innovation thrives — had thrown its gates open to the public to glimpse the technological wonders brewing in its labs. The much-anticipated Open Day at the IISc brought people from cities from other states a few hours from Bengaluru, apart from bringing thousands of local residents. Besides students, the event also lured science enthusiasts. The exchange of ideas and feedback on the researches are regarded as important by the organisers. The event featured lectures, experiment demos, poster presentations, quiz contests, science competitions and exhibitions in various departments. The ‘Kids Zone’ was the main draw for young students where various science and technology demos were on display. “This was something I had been waiting for after my exams. This event gave me clear ideas of the latest innovations that will help my studies,” said Vaibhav M S, a student at Christ Public School, Mysuru, told DH. One of the visitors, Siddeshwara from Chitradurga, said scheduling it in mid- or last week of April would increase its audience. “The SSLC exams are going on. The second PU students, who could be significantly benefited from this event, are busy preparing for the CET,” he said, adding that a day is insufficient to visit all the departments. The segments that lured more visitors included aerospace engineering, robotic science, brain research, ecological sciences, civil engineering and mechanical engineering. The summer heat had made visitors hop on to the e-rickshaws recently introduced on the campus, while some students used the bicycles.

At IISc’s Open Day, take 'Stoch' of the situation	Visitors to the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) campus on its ‘Open Day’ on March 23 will be welcomed by a dog-like walking robot.The Open Day is when the public can interact with the researchers on the campus, besides watching experiments live between 9 am and 5 pm.The Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered robot on display — developed in-house at the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems and christened “Stoch” — can walk on different terrains.Also vying for the visitor’s attention will be projects on AI, machine learning and live demonstration of drones. Prof Y Narahari, divisional head at IISc’s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, said the robot is just two feet in length.“Stoch has 12 joints (three per leg) to generate motion similar to a quadrupedal animal (a dog or cat),” added Dhaivat Dholakiya from the Institute.The prototype of the self-operational robot which the Institute has developed could also be used as a rover on the moon, Prof Narahari revealed. “We have used Reinforcement Learning and AI-based technique to generate these walking behaviours,” Dholakiya said.“In a nutshell, we’ve tried to make the robot learn the walking behaviour by itself using the algorithm.”The unmanned aerial vehicles show by the department of aerospace engineering is expected to draw more crowds this time as well.IISc said at least 1,000 of its 4,500 students are involved in organising the Open Day. Visitors will be engaged in science lectures, demos and exhibitions.A special children’s zone has been planned at the old aerospace building. Parents and teachers are barred at this area.The IISc, taking cue from the recent fire incident at Aero India, have decided to stay on high alert.They have sought permission from the department of fire and emergency services to station a fire extinguisher on the campus.

No consent for new borewells in core areas of Bengaluru	In an effort to conserve the existing groundwater level, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has decided not to give permission to sink new borewells in the core areas of the city.Following the decision taken in a joint meeting with the members of Karnataka Groundwater Authority on February 27, the board, which is the authority to grant permission for new borewells, has not processed a single application since March 01.According to a BWSSB official, it was decided not to grant permission for new borewells in the core areas where Cauvery water is supplied and that no applications would be processed till the monsoon.However, those areas where there is no supply of Cauvery water, especially in 110 villages located on the outskirts of the city, new applications may be entertained.The official said as people living on the fringes of the city completely depend on borewell for their water needs, new applications will be processed there. But of the hundreds of applications received, hardly three to four are from the 110 village areas, he added.Kemparamaiah, BWSSB engineer-in-chief, said as there is more demand for water during summer, it is quite obvious that more people want to sink new borewells.“We are not completely restricting. However, we also have to check excessive drilling of borewells that leads to exploitation of groundwater,” he added.Kemparamaiah said there should also be some restriction on the extraction of water from borewells also as they are bound to be exploited. There is a need for some metering system to limit drawing of water from certain borewells.According to an official from the Karnataka Groundwater Authority there was no metering system to check the extraction of water from borewell till now. However there are plans to implement the system in the future, he added.Saving groundwaterSince January 2019, 633 applications received to sink new borewells. Only 138 applications have been processed and approved.Most of the applications from the core areas rejected. According to official records, there are about 3.71 borewells in the city.

Lake buffer zone: Builders want green OKs reassessed	"Builders are asking the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) if green clearance issued to them could be revisited after the Supreme Court reversed the NGT buffer zone order. In February, the apex court issued an order reversing the National Green Tribunal's order to maintain a 75-metre buffer zone around lakes, which the Karnataka government had challenged in the court. ""Builders have been enquiring if they can reapply for fresh environmental clearance or if existing clearance could be modified,"" an SEIAA officer said. ""The enquiries are of two categories: the ones that have obtained clearance and the ones applied recently. Around 25 clearances were given in 2017-18, but now around 30 enquiries have come so far."" The officer said builders are now reviewing all their projects, including the ones designated for expansion. This is the first time such reviews are happening. Some builders are also confused about the order. Following the NGT order, the SEIAA asked builders to reassess their applications to comply with the stipulations or face rejection. It issued clearances based on the NGT specifications of leaving a 75-metre buffer zone around lakes and a 50-metre space around rajakaluves (stormwater drains. The authority is yet to issue new clearances for new projects after the Supreme Court order. Vijaykumar Gogi, member secretary, SEIAA, said he was yet to receive any enquiries. He, however, said people could seek modifications on projects that were yet to begin construction, though nothing much could be done once construction had begun. He said the applications will be relooked into by the committee. ""They could come back (for reassessment) if there's a change in the plan that allows for modification,"" Gogi said. He did not see a need for fresh notification, clarification or new order by the Urban Development Department since the NGT order, which superseded it, has been reversed by the Supreme Court."

CIMA revises integrated BCom course syllabus at Christ	"The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) launched its revised syllabus at CHRIST (Deemed to be University) in the city on Tuesday. CIMA, a leading professional body of management accountants, offers a CIMA-integrated BCom professional course with a focus on management accounting. This is the 10th year of the collaboration between CIMA and CHRIST (Deemed to be University). According to CIMA, CHRIST has the highest number of students pursuing a professional course in the world, higher than the number in the London School of Economics as of the previous year. Biju Toms, Head, Department of Professional Studies, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), said the revision of syllabus happens once in every two years and this year's launch was in India. ""They have covered 150 countries to identify the learning gap and formulate a syllabus that includes concepts that make students industry-ready,"" he said.""Last year, 43 students took the course. CIMA benchmarked our syllabus and found a lot of common areas. Students have to clear 17 papers to qualify, which will help them get better jobs. Being upskilled is needed as several jobs would soon be taken away due to automation,"" he added. Dr Noel Tagoe, executive vice president, Academics, CIMA, said the new syllabus was designed in consultation with 5,500 professionals working in 2,000 organisations across the world. He said that with automation putting a need to several jobs students are required to learn new concepts such as Cloud Computing, Data Analytics, Data Visualisation, Block Chain, Internet of Things, 3-D printing, Process Automation and Artificial Intelligence. Speaking about India's economy, Tagoe said political and economic openness is needed in India. Drawing a comparison between India and China, he said: ""China is the second largest economy in the world. They have nearly the same resources as India. It is just a matter of time that they will outdo the world's largest economy,"" he said."	Chartered Institute of Management Accountants,Christ (Deemed to be University),	 Mar 20 2019
'Knives, pins safety tools for blind women'	Facing safety challenges, visually impaired women across the state are forced to carry folding knives and safety pins.A survey on the condition of working women with visual impairment conducted by Karnataka State Government Employee's Association for the Blind also stated that the government has not trained them in navigation and smart mobility technology such as the smartphone app Eye-D, electronic canes, Google Map and other navigational aids.Out of the 87 women affiliated with the association, 4 of them took part in the survey. “We’re going to submit the report (of the survey) to the Administrative Training Institute in Mysuru, which in turn will submit the report to the state Chief Secretary,” the organisation’s president Ramesh said.“The survey’s intended to check what needs to be done in terms of welfare and empowerment of visually impaired women in the state. Through the survey, we’re also asking the state to train them in using the safety and mobility aids,” Ramesh added.The survey found that in the absence of technology training, visually impaired women resort to primitive aids like folding knives, safety pins and even the stylus they use to punch the Braille code for self-defence.While most of them use technology, those unfamiliar with modern aids are willing to get trained at the earliest. “Mobility training is vital for all blind people to navigate freely,” he said.	safety measures,	 Mar 20 2019
Once there was a sparrow	Try as you might, you will be find it hard to come across sparrows in Bengaluru. Once ubiquitous, the little bird is yet to return to the city, thanks to reckless urbanisation.Ornithologists are now calling for sustained efforts to revive the dwindling sparrow population in the city.According to them, just keeping nest boxes and feeders have yielded little results over the years. Since the last five years, on every World Sparrow Day on March 20, ornithologists and conservationists distribute around 100 bamboo-made, nest and feeder boxes free of cost. Each box costs the distributor around Rs 400. But the initiative doesn’t seem to have helped.As a result, sparrows have now become localised to smaller places in the city, such as Yeshwanthpur or KR Market, which is not a good sign.Ornithologists are now requesting the government and builders to change the construction pattern and build more eco-friendly buildings having crevices.They add that city outskirts, where sparrows are found, need careful planning. According to them, the Kempegowda International Airport is a threat for sparrows. Ecologist and ornithologist M B Krishna says there has been little success with the nest boxes. “It is important to understand that it is about just nest boxes but creating an environment for sparrows. Pollution, loss of native trees and lung spaces are also a major concern,” he says.According to him, sparrows need insects, which can be found on native and fruit-bearing tree species, instead of mono-culture and lawns. The idea of BBMP creating smaller parks is good.“To bring them back a lot needs to be done, especially in town planning,” says Krishna.Sudhira H S, Director Gubbi Labs, who did a study on sparrows, says over 40 sparrows were seen near Yeshwanthpur railway station on Tumkur Road.“But after the tree was cut to make way for foot overbridge, they disappeared. A few individual sparrows were seen in Malleswaram 5th Cross, but since last year they are not to be seen. Some can still be seen in Sudhamanagar, Jakkur and Sanjayanagar,” says Sudhira.Mohammed Dilawar, Founder and President of Nature Forever Society, popularly known as ‘Sparrow Man’, advocates planting local tree species apart from keeping nest boxes.“There is also a need for sustained effort. Many pay attention for a month or so and later forget. Government and builders should also be roped in for eco- friendly buildings,” he says.	Bengaluru,sparrows,	 Mar 20 2019
Nine held in advocate Dharani's suicide case:govt to HC	Nine people have been arrested in relation to a case pertaining to the alleged suicide of advocate Dharani S, the government informed the High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday.The government said three persons were still absconding and all efforts were being made to arrest them.The court was hearing a petition filed by Advocates’ Association, Bengaluru, which had sought transfer of probe in the case to the CBI.Dharani committed suicide on December 31, 2018, at her home in Mahadevapura police limits after alleged harassment by the local corporator.The state had sought two weeks to submit a report in the case. The court gave the police a week to file a status report on the investigation and the action taken.The state also informed the court that it has written to the Deputy Inspector General of Police to take action against the Mahadevpura police inspector.The court also pulled up the police for their laxity in the investigation and orally observed that the life of the young advocate could have been saved if they had taken timely action.The court also observed that there was a serious lapse on part of the police as no efforts were made to arrest the accused.The hearing of the case was adjourned to March 26.

Disaster management, film media among new BU courses	Bangalore University (BU) is all set to offer disaster management, film media and animation graphics courses from the next academic year, 2019-20.The framework for the same is already set, where the film media, animation and graphics courses will be functioning under the electronic media department and the disaster management course under the department of geography.“A team from BU’s geography department had visited flood-hit Kodagu last year, where the design of the course was planned. Though the course was in the pipeline much before that. So, the curriculum has been finalised, where the admission for the same will happen from the next academic year. This would be one of the professional courses in geography,” a senior official from BU told DH.BU will be offering MSc in Disaster Management, MA in Film Studies and MA in Animation and Graphics from next academic year. As the most number of seats remained vacant the previous year, the BU syndicate decided to give importance for professional courses. Since film media and animation and graphics have greater scope, they have finalised the curriculum.“We have the infrastructure to start the above courses. For animation and graphics, all we need is computer systems, which will be set up at a reasonable cost. And for film media, we are planning to tie up with film institutes, which will be more than happy to help us in practicals. A few years down the line, we will be having our own film institute on the campus,” Venugopal K R, vice-chancellor, BU, told DH.Talking about disaster management, Venugopal added: “It’s not necessary to approach disaster management from a negative perspective. It could also be about avoiding the adverse effects of a natural calamity or the management after a disaster. Due to climate change, the world is open to the risk of many natural calamities. The course is designed in such a way that the students will be exposed to all the aspects, like medical emergencies and others.”	Film Making,Bangalore University,disaster management,new courses,	 Mar 19 2019
Bengaluru girl to attend LindauNobel laureates’ meet	City girl Rijutha Jaganathan is all set to meet Nobel laureates from across the globe, where she hopes to gather further insights from the renowned personalities.Rijutha is one among the 580 young scientists from 88 countries, chosen to attend the 69th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in Germany scheduled from June 30 to July 5.Rijutha, 25, is currently doing her PhD at Aarhus University, Denmark. She is also a part of the EU project - Europah, where ongoing research focuses on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.A resident of Koramangala, Rijutha studied at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai before moving to Denmark in 2017 to pursue doctoral studies.Her passion for astronomy was kindled at a young age when she would stay up all night, along with her parents, to watch the occasional meteor shower or the lunar eclipse. She was a regular at the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium.“I combined my passion for astronomy to my work. I am doing research on experimental surface science techniques like Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy to study and understand the catalytic properties of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium,” she told DH from Denmark.In 2012, Rijutha was one among the 30 undergraduates selected from all over India to attend the 6th Asian Science Camp in Israel, where 5-6 Nobel laureates interacted with young scientists over a few days.“It was a turning point in my life. Till then I had believed that only highly intelligent people studying in the best universities in the world can be scientists. Listening to Nobel laureates and their stories made me realise that passion and dedication are all that one needs,” she said.She said the Lindau Meet will be the perfect opportunity to widen her network in the scientific community and get inspired to come up with original research ideas for her career in science.

Govt hospital runs out of medicines for rare diseases	Six-year-old Jaishruthi is waiting to get treatment for a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) at the government-run Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH).However, the hospital has discontinued treating the patients with rare diseases for the past 10 weeks as it has run out of medicine stock. The fresh supply can be purchased only after the government releases grant after which the hospital floats tenders.Pavitra, Jaishruthi’s mother, said they had approached the court to get an order for their daughter to be treated free of cost for LSD at the hospital.“We have been meeting many officials and ministers to get our daughter treated. While this is taking time, my daughter is running out of time,” Pavitra said.Similarly, Revathi (12), who was under medication for Gaucher, also a rare disease, has not been given a dosage of the medication since January.Shivashankar, her father, said he was also struggling to get the medicines. “It has been 45 days since my daughter has received her dose of medicine for gaucher. Although she is attending her school, she is getting tired very quickly which is not a good sign,” said Shivashankar.Meanwhile, Prasanna Kumar Shirol, executive director of Organisation for Rare Diseases in India (ORBI), said as the IGICH does not have a director, procuring medicines is taking time as they have to call fresh tenders.“Treatment for LSD including, gaucher, pompe and mucopolysaccharide (MPS), is very expensive. The amount depends on the weight of the patients. So for 10 kg, the cost of the medicine would go up to Rs 40 lakh per month. The high court has directed the government to treat these patients and the government allocates funds for this purpose,” he added.Dr Naveen Benakappa, the in-charge director and medical superintendent, IGICH, said the government granted Rs 3 crore to get medications for the rare diseases. “We have got the funds three days ago and will shortly procure the medicines directly without floating any tenders,” he added.	government hospital,	 Mar 19 2019

Sunscalded trees to get soothing balm this Holi	Thousands of trees in the city that die or get affected due to sun scalding and insect attacks will get a new life this Holi, as a group of youths has come to their rescue.The Heartfulness Green has launched an initiative ‘PeaceTrees’ in over 40 cities across India, where they will paint the trees with a mixture of herbal extract and natural lime. In Bengaluru, the event is scheduled to be held in Indiranagar on the day of Holi.“This initiative will be carried out to give a special meaning to the festival. Heartfulness, its partner organisations and local communities aim to spread the message of peace by applying this mixture on the trees on the festival of colours,” Sourabh Shinde, the organiser of the campaign told DH“Painting trees with the mixture of lime and herbal extract helps protect them from the scorching summer heat, termites, insects, infections and cracking of the bark. So Holi is not just about playing with colours. We want to make it eco-friendly,” Shinde added. Beside painting trees, the campaign also includes planting endemic tree saplings. The month-long event is scheduled in over 40 cities all over the country.Sourabh said: “The initiative is very economical. To paint 500 trees, it will cost us anywhere between Rs 700 and Rs 1,000. It is the same amount an individual or a group spends to celebrate to get Holi colour. So its not hefty on our pockets.” More than 500 volunteers are said to be taking part in the campaign and the number is expected to cross thousand.	Holi,trees,	 Mar 19 2019
Illegal borewells on Muthanalluru lakebed wind up	The 10-odd illegal borewells that were dug on the Muthanalluru lakebed for commercial purposes have been shut down by the officials.Unauthorised water traders drilled borewells in the buffer zone of the lake. “None of the borewells were authorised by the concerned authorities. Nor they were used for agricultural purposes. The water drawn from the borewells was sold as a commodity,” said Major Santhosh Kumar.“The authorities took action immediately after it was brought to their notice. I had written to the tahsildar and panchayat officials. Finally, the borewells were closed,” he added. Under the Karnataka Groundwater (Regulation and Control of Development and Management) Act, 2011, every borewell in the city should be registered.The notification said violators would be fined Rs 10,000 or sent to three years in prison.	illegal borewells,Muthanalluru lakebed,	 Mar 19 2019
Woman accuses investigating cops of harassment	A woman accused of cheating a US-based software engineer has filed a complaint against the police investigating her. Ramya Nair, employed with a private company, complained to the city police commissioner that the Parappana Agrahara police were harassing her and her father by filing a false cheating complaint.The police registered an FIR against Ramya and her father Kunjiraman T K following a complaint filed by Jothi Krishnan, a US-based software engineer. It was alleged that she had cheated him to the tune of Rs 18 lakh on the pretext of marriage.Instead of investigating the case, the police are making continuous phone calls and forcing her to marry him, she said.Ramya said she came into contact with Krishnan on a matrimonial website in 2013. “I was preparing for my civil service exams. He wanted to marry me, but my family members did not agree.“Later, we continued as friends. I needed money and borrowed it from him, but I returned the entire amount after two years and I have proof of that,” she said.Ramya said Krishnan began pressing her for marriage again, but she did not agree. He then sent her obscene messages, and when she completely ignored him, he filed a false complaint against her.“The police are now threatening to arrest me and tarnish our image. After harassing us for nearly a week, they finally registered an FIR on March 14,” she stated.“We stay in Puttenahalli near JP Nagar, but the complaint has been filed at Parappana Agrahara. The police are supporting Krishnan,” she said.Ramya also said despite filing a complaint against Krishnan with the Puttenahalli police a month ago, no action has been taken.Krishnan, for his part, said in his complaint that he paid Ramya Rs 18 lakh on various occasions since 2013.Though Ramya and her family agreed for the marriage, they vacated the house when he visited them on February 20 to speak about their engagement.	harassment complaint,Bengaluru City Police,Cops,	 Mar 18 2019
Things to do at weekends in Bengaluru	There’s a lot more to Bengaluru than its pubs and breweries. Tourists should not only visit the city’s watering holes but also explore its rich culture. This is the crux of the state government’s latest move to redefine the Brand Bengaluru. Taking the budget announcement forward, the government has directed the Tourism and Kannada and Culture departments to prepare plans on how best the local culture can be showcased. The government wants to expand the Brand Bengaluru beyond the Pub Capital of India element. “This is not what Bengaluru is all about. There is nothing much for people to do during weekends. We do not want to shed the Pub Capital image, but want to add more elements,” government sources said. Cultural showsOne of the ways to make the city more vibrant, said Priyanka Mary Francis, Director, Department of Tourism, is to create museum and music circuits along with weekend cultural shows. The department is drawing a plan by roping in KPMG, the global professional service company, to host night-long mythological and historical theatre plays during weekends. Folk music shows on the lines of rock shows, Yakshagana performances and dramas are also on the cards. Janapada Jatre The chief minister’s budget speech spoke about holding Jatres (fairs) across Karnataka, including in Bengaluru. But the two departments are not keen on holding the Janapada Jatre because of traffic congestion on Bengaluru roads. A traditional Jatre would comprise Goravara Kunitha, Veeragase, Dollu Kunitha, Pata Dance, Thamate and Jaggalige drums. B H Anil Kumar, Additional Chief Secretary, Kannada and Culture Department, said Jatres could potentially block traffic on the city’s roads. That’s why the focus is on other activities that attract the youth. Events with limited reachAccording to Kumar, cultural shows are happening in the city but they are organised by private organisations or individuals, limiting their reach and scope. Besides, they hardly attract youth.	Bengaluru,events,	 Mar 17 2019
Unlucky streak shatters street vendor’s dream	Here’s a story quite resonant with the times we live in — of unemployment and the struggle to make ends meet. Many are losing out like this vegetable vendor, whose dream of upgrading his trade ended on a bad note. Suresh G K, 41, came up in life competing with e-commerce giants, earning Rs 500 a day selling vegetables in his small shop. He rented the shop after being evicted by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) from a footpath he had set up shop in Kamalanagar near Basaveshwara Nagar. Suresh had to take care of his family — a 6-year-old son, an 11-year-old daughter, wife and parents. He convinced his wife that he would do well in the vegetable business if he purchased a goods auto-rickshaw. His wife, over the past four years, had saved up for the children’s school fees. The couple used the money as down payment and bought a brand new goods auto worth Rs 2.20 lakh. The rest of the money came from a loan. The accidentOne day, dreaming of his flourishing business, Suresh was riding his new auto-rickshaw with a temporary registration plate, taking it for alteration work to stack vegetables. But fate had something else in the store. To avoid a bike that was about to collide head-on with his auto and to save a child perched on the petrol tank of that bike, Suresh veered to the side but collided with a stationary Maruti Ritz. Car owner Raghu seized the auto and demanded Rs 15,000 for repairs. Until Suresh brought the money, Raghu would not release the vehicle. Since Raghu did not have space to park the auto, he sent it to his sister’s house in Annapurneshwari Nagar. Suresh scrambled and arranged the money, but sadly his mother was hospitalised.

RTO official dining with actor assaulted by her friend	An RTO official was caught in the crossfire when he tried to intervene during a heated argument between Kannada actor Ragini Dwivedi and one of her friends at a star hotel on March 15. He was left with a head injury after the actor’s friend hit him with a beer bottle. Ravishankar, the RTO official, was having dinner with Dwivedi and other friends at the Ritz-Carlton, Residency Road. Shivaprakash, a friend of the actor’s, came up to their table around 11 pm and got into a heated argument with her. When Ravishankar tried to intervene, Shivaprakash grabbed a beer bottle and smashed it on his head, bleeding him in no time. Other members of the group separated them and whisked Ravishankar away from the hotel. Ravishankar later approached the jurisdictional Ashoknagar police and filed a complaint. Police booked Shivaprakash under IPC sections 324 (assault using dangerous weapons), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke the breach of peace).Dwivedi could not be reached for comment as her phone was switched off. On his part, Shivaprakash claimed that he was in Mysuru and that he was being “unnecessarily” dragged into the matter.	Ragini Dwivedi,	 Mar 17 2019
BBMP raids shopping malls	"It has been three years since the government banned the manufacturing and use of plastic, but traders and the public remain obsessed over its use.So, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike decided to launch a crackdown on plastic use, and on Saturday, targeted swanky malls in the city. They found a flagrant violation of the plastic ban by traders, who used plastic materials disregarding rules.As the team of BBMP health officials raided six shopping malls — Orion mall (west zone), Garuda mall (east zone), Forum mall (south zone), Phoenix mall in Mahadevapura, RMZ Galleria in Yelahanka and Meenakshi mall in Bommanahalli — they found a popular supermarket chain and ice cream stores violating the plastic ban.Firms operating in these malls did not segregate dry and wet waste. The shops were collectively fined Rs 13.15 lakh, while officials seized about one tonne of plastic materials (1,010 kilograms), including packing materials and cups.""The civic body received complaints that many malls have failed to comply with the plastic ban,"" BBMP health officer Balasundar A S said.""The malls in the six zones were found using plastic in shops, food courts, supermarkets and upscale showrooms."" The BBMP has also cancelled trade licences of four hotels operating in these malls."	BBMP,	 Mar 17 2019

Life on Bengaluru's Namma Metro	Travelling in private cars or on two-wheelers has become a tiresome task in Bengaluru. And Namma Metro has come as a boon for those, including this author, to escape the drudgery of driving back after a tiring day at work.The Metro is a great way to get around in Bengaluru. But it can be a tough ride at peak hours in jam-packed coaches, with commuters getting squeezed and subjected to a lot of jostling. This is one of the negative sides of a Metro ride. But, it is not all bad news. There is an ample number of people amusing fellow passengers with their antics and thus providing comic relief during a trying journey.Silly antics I have witnessed can be stress busters, but some dangerous things people do make me wonder if they just don’t care about their or fellow passengers’ safety.Wrong platform Deciphering the signage to enter the right platform can be a tough task for those who are not regulars on the Metro. But it does no harm to ask the Metro staff about the right platform. This author saw a recent incident when a young couple barged onto a platform, but saw their train entering the station on the other side. “Oh s@!&” went the gentleman before commencing the long trudge to the right side.Eager for entry Everyone is clearly told to give way to alighting passengers. Along comes a guy who firmly believes he is within his rights to enter before others can exit. Sure, all of us would like to get into the car quickly. But his exuberance in trying to get in surely made other passengers and me wonder what he is going to gain out of doing this. He is clearly inconveniencing others. The bloke fell into line only after getting a mouthful from the security staff.No entry It seems like all common sense can fail at times. Standing in a long queue to enter is boring no doubt. Wondering why the rush on that day, passengers had to sulk and bear it. There was one lady who decided to do something about it – trying to enter through the exit gate. Much to the amusement of the passengers in the queue, she repeatedly tried to swipe the token despite a red ‘X’ on the display indicating no entry. Better sense prevailed after a few failed attempts and passengers in the queue had a bit of entertainment.In your face Travelling during peak hours can be uncomfortable no doubt. But it can get embarrassing too as passengers are stuffed like sardines in a can. I, just like other passengers, find it rather annoying when my face is just a few centimetres away from another person’s. What makes things worse is realising that one can’t even turn away. Even if one manages to wriggle in another direction, there is every chance of another ‘in your face’ encounter.No network Watching videos on YouTube or listening to music is a great way to kill time on the Metro. The odd passenger can get frustrated if the data transfer stops in the underground sections. What is amusing is the fact that the hardcore movie and music lovers don’t want any pause to their ‘entertaining’ journey. Funnily, they don’t give up and try to refresh the page, press play/ pause more than a few times. No avail, theirs is an agonising wait till the train emerges from the underground section.Door confusion Again, occasional Metro travellers have a tough time figuring out which side the doors will open where they need to get off. Which side the doors will open is announced well in advance. There are a few who are in a different world and pay no attention to the announcement. The result is a heroic effort to get through the maze of people. The more aggressive ones manage it. For a few, it is a return journey back to the right station.Use deodorant pleaseNamma Metro cars are air-conditioned and travelling is a ‘cool’ experience. No question about pollution or dust, but one has to put up with another problem – smelly passengers. The last thing one would want is a smelly fellow passenger as a neighbour. If it was the Mumbai trains, the breeze would take away some of the odour. But, in the Metro, one has to just tolerate it. The thought of telling the ‘offending’ person to use deodorant unfortunately can only remain a thought.Escalator charge Not seen Carl Lewis and Marion Jones in action? The Metro could provide you with a glimpse of their extraordinary speed. The announcement says the train is about to pull into the station. That is the trigger for a quick sprint up the escalator to catch the train, but that success is only after pushing and shoving a few people up the escalator.It is understandable that people are in a hurry to get to their destination as quickly as possible. However, it is important to spare a thought for fellow passengers. It might be funny at times, but some of these antics could lead to a serious accident. A dozen alighting passengers could knock a person down because they are in a hurry to get off too before the train leaves.Namma Metro has framed rules for a safe and a comfortable journey. It is best that commuters follow them even if it means a little less entertainment on the journey back home from work.	two-wheeler,driving,train,Namma Metro,Bengaluru,passenger,car,	 Mar 16 2019
Big rally against elevated corridor project today	Taking to the streets against the elevated corridor project, various citizens’ groups from different parts of Bengaluru have called for a mega protest rally on Saturday at the Maurya Circle behind the Race Course. More than 50 RWA members will stage a demonstration demanding cancellation of the tenders for the controversial project. The protest will begin at 10 am in front of the Gandhi statue at Maurya Circle.The citizens’ groups that had rallied against the steel flyover project a few years ago, have again come together with a bigger coalition of civic, social and RWAs from different parts of the city.In fact, considering the large turnout, several political parties have expressed their support for Saturday’s demonstration.However, the citizens’ groups have rejected any political support citing that all political parties have collectively contributed to the growing mess. Organisers have clarified that it will be a peaceful demonstration.	elevated corridor project,	 Mar 16 2019
Contaminated groundwater could be destroying kidneys	Next time you drink a glass of water, remember this: The city’s groundwater is filled with deadly chemicals and radioactive metals. When used for drinking water purposes, contaminated water can lead to a host of health problems. One of the toxic substances found in the city’s groundwater is uranium - a radioactive substance that is known to cause kidney damage.A 2015 study by the Department of Physics in Bangalore University - “Radiological and chemical toxicity due to ingestion of uranium through drinking water in the environment of Bangalore, India” - found presence of uranium in borewells in southern Bengaluru.In the study, 61% of 96 borewells contained uranium within the safe limit of 30μgL−1 (micrograms per litre) as set by the World Health Organisation. About 6% of the samples showed values higher than the acceptable level for radiological risk and 39% of the samples showed risk due to chemical toxicity of uranium.Dr N Nagaiah, professor, department of physics, Bangalore University, said that uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element found in certain groundwater samples. “Whether this concentration of radioactive elements has affected the health of the citizens through kidney damage is something which needs to be studied in the long run,” he added.Dr Manjunath, nephrologist, BR Life SSNMC Hospital, said ingestion of heavy and radioactive metals through water and air can damage kidneys.“One of the major cause of kidney disease in recent days is uranium-contaminated water,”said Manjunath. “This causes chronic interstitial nephritis and leads to kidney disease. Increased exposure to an excess amount of uranium can cause permanent damage to the kidneys. It also increases the risk of hypertension, and anaemia or low blood count. The pollutant in the water gets stored in the body, especially in the bones, kidneys and liver after oral ingestion or inhalation.” Dr Sushma Rani R, senior consultant, Nephrology, Sakra World Hospital, said uranium in groundwater gets accumulated in kidneys and other organs. “It especially affects the tubular functions of the kidney and may cause chronic kidney disease. Problems arise when there is chronic ingestion of uranium in drinking water. Uranium is more harmful due to its toxic nature rather than its radioactivity and it has been identified as a kidney toxin by World Health Organization (WHO),” she said.

Garbage piling up on Whitefield's Nallurahalli Main Rd	Garbage is piling up along the Nallurahalli Main Road near Whitefield. The residents are blaming the BBMP for irregular garbage collection.Residents say the black spot appeared last week. “There was never such a pile up, except for some plastic. Now it is piling up over the past few days, the place stinks. We requested the health inspector to take action after which the garbage was cleared. But today, the garbage pile has appeared again,” said Sharma Desi, a resident.“We have raised complaints with the BBMP via Sahaya app. Hope it gets cleared up soon,” Desi added. Another resident, Hemamalini said: “The BBMP doesn’t pick up the garbage regularly from the area and obviously, this will force residents to throw garbage on the roads.”	Bengaluru,Garbage crisis,BBMP,	 Mar 15 2019

Dehydrated birds, animals suffering this summer	Erratic weather pattern is threatening the life of birds and animals in the city. With temperatures soaring, the mortality rate of city fauna is set to surge.Activists and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) are now conducting awareness campaigns to keep water bowls in the open for birds and animals.Recently, K Mohan, member of the BBMP animal rescue team (forest cell) saved five different varieties of birds, found lying unconscious due to dehydration from heat stroke in the city.The maximum temperature in the city touched 37 degrees Celsius last week, severely affecting birds and animals in the predominantly concrete landscape.Various Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) along with the civic body have rescued more than 300 birds from the start of February.“The animals are dying due to dehydration. More than 300 birds and animals have been rescued till now,” Mohan told DH.“Birds such as black kites, owls, sparrows, pigeons, crows and animals like dogs, cats, cows, squirrels and monkeys are suffering. Most of the calls we receive are to rescue these animals and birds,” he added.Rescue teams rush to the spot and immediately shift the bird or animal to the nearest veterinary clinic or hospital and inject a dose of glucose. They will be kept in the rehabilitation centre till they recover and will be released later.“The volunteers from NGOs and the BBMP are now advising the residents on how to protect animals from heat strokes. Placing water bowls in backyards and terraces is the first step,” explained Mohan.Sanjeev Pednekar, the founder of ‘Prani, the pet sanctuary’, near Somanahalli off Kanakpura road, blames the lack of green cover and seasonal changes in environment.Both citizens and authorities have to play a role to save the fauna during summer. The citizens should place water bowls and provide facilities like birdbaths in the garden, he added.Pednekar also stressed the need for more veterinary hospitals and doctors in the city.“The BBMP should make it mandatory for future developmental projects and high-rises to incorporate architectural elements like birdbaths,” he said.	weather,Bengaluru,Heat,	 Mar 13 2019
City inventor shows ‘Make in India’ solution for piles	A city-based inventor and a government health official unveiled a new device to address the sticky problem of piles, which they said contributes to a 40% decline in workforce efficiency.Speaking to DH on Tuesday, Dr Rajah Vijay Kumar, described piles or hemorrhoids, as not only being one of the oldest known ailments known to humans but also the most secretive. “Husbands don’t tell wives, wives don’t tell husbands,” he said.In an effort to keep the condition secret, sufferers spurn their doctors and instead turn to unlicensed medical practitioners for ointments, creams and suppositories, added Dr T S Prabhakar of the Karnataka Department of Health and Family Welfare.“This new device is a way to fight back against quacks,” Dr Prabhakar said adding that the government had registered several deaths due to treatments recommended by unlicensed practitioners. Dr Prabhakar could not be reached later for clarification.The device, which is priced at roughly Rs 6,900 per unit, involves cooling its inner nano-material to a temperature of -18 degrees C, using a common freezer. Once cooled, the device is applied to the affected area where the nano material gradually releases cold temperatures over a 10-minute period.Dr Kumar insisted the procedure could be be done in the privacy of one’s home and was relatively non-invasive. “There is no cold shock or frostbite,” he said. “I am proud to say that I was patient number one.”When queried about the cost of the product which might deter some Indians, Samson John, director of a renewable energy company which has partnered with Dr Kumar, insisted that it is the cheapest solution to treating piles in the market. “Ointments are a temporary measure and surgeries are expensive and time-consuming,” he said. “Of the 1,291 people who used the device in clinical trials, 88.7% said they had been cured.”As per figures released by WHO and the Rajiv Gandhi Institute, roughly 41 million people in India suffer from piles. Furthermore, 1.2 million new cases are diagnosed every year, said Dr Kumar. Nearly 40% of these are pregnant women while 60% are people living in South India. The harmful effects of the condition is said to cause job absenteeism and a 30 to 40% drop in efficiency across the job market.	Bengaluru,Make in India,Piles,	 Mar 13 2019
 1 lakh saplings for more green cover in all 198 wards	At a time when the city’s green cover is declining rapidly, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is to take up a massive planting drive in all the 198 wards. Around 1 lakh saplings will be planted across eight zones of the BBMP with the support of volunteers from various non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The BBMP has earmarked Rs 5 crore in the recent budget for the initiative. “To improve the city’s green cover and beautification, we have already finalised tender for 75,000 saplings. The saplings are ready in our four nurseries and will be planted soon,” M K Cholarajappa, deputy conservator of forests (DCF), BBMP, told DH. The civic body has already distributed around 6 lakh saplings through the BBMP Green app, launched to give away saplings to residents. “The Palike is distributing free saplings through the mobile app. Citizens can go to BBMP-managed parks and collect the saplings. The saplings can be planted in residential compounds or along the side of the road,” added Cholarajappa. The saplings include mostly indigenous varieties -- among them are trees valued for timber, honge and mahogany.Flowering tree saplings that will be made available are hole dasavala, huvarasi, sampige, basavana pada, tabebuia, jacaranda and tabebuia guayacan. Fruit-bearing trees kadu badami, jamun, gooseberry, cherry and medicinal trees like neem, simarouba and tapasi also figure in the list.“The saplings will be planted in areas that require green cover, BBMP lands and protected lands across the city. The BBMP alone cannot be responsible for the watering, and tending to all the saplings. Hence, partnering with NGOs and people are important,” the DCF explained.	BBMP,Tree plantation,	 Mar 12 2019
Amid water crisis, citizens get half-bucket challenge	The largest body of apartments in Bengaluru is running a social media campaign, urging its members to bath in half a bucket of water so as to reduce the pressure on the city’s depleting water resources. The BAFHalfBucketChallenge thrown by the Bangalore Apartments’ Federation highlights growing concerns over water scarcity in the city as the summer sets in. One of the social media messages reads ‘Looming water crisis in Bengaluru! I took bath with half a bucket of water! Can you?’ The BAF has about 400 apartment complexes as members, representing over 70,000 flats and two lakh people. The federation believes Bengaluru is in the throes of a water crisis with groundwater running dry in many places and the supply of Cauvery water becoming erratic.While the government and civic agencies are working towards reviving the lakes and improving the water supply, citizens can do their bit by reducing water consumption through simple measures. Srikanth Narasimhan, the general secretary of the BAF and a resident of Brigade Paramount, Old Madras Road, said that all these years, their apartment managed with borewell water, but this year they were compelled to buy water from private tankers. “I have been bathing with half a bucket of water for quite some time and it’s pretty easy. It just takes a little bit of a mindset change and a focus on water conservation,” he added. Ajay Mehrotra, joint secretary, BAF, said their aim was to make the campaign viral where people could post simple messages on Facebook or Twitter, saying they had done it successfully and tagging at least three friends, throwing them the same challenge. K V Prasanna, vice president, BAF, said people must take the challenge a notch higher and see how they could reduce the overall consumption of water by half.“This is very important as the city’s water resources are going to be continuously under strain as the population keeps increasing,” he added.	water shortage,Bengaluru,	 Mar 12 2019
Farmers to protest today over PRR delay	Over 3,000 farmers will gather at the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) head office on Tuesday in protest against the government over the delay in the Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) project.The farmers, who have lost land to the ambitious project, said they are not against the PRR. Instead, they want the project to start so that they can get proper compensation and move on with their lives.Raghu, a farmer participating in the protest, said: “We were given notice for land acquisition in 2005. But to this day, nothing has happened. We can use the soil for cultivation, but cannot dig borewells. We cannot mortgage the property for a loan or seek help from financiers as our land has been marked for the project.”Most of them have to get their daughters married, support the education of their children or meet the medical expenses of ailing family members.“In the last 10 years, the government has only conducted meetings. In the last two years, the BDA has not even called for any meeting. Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, who claims to be a pro-farmer CM, has also done nothing. In the name of loan waiver, he has neglected us, as our land is listed to be acquired for development,” said another farmer.Due to the uncalled-for delay, farmers have now agreed to part with their land for cash compensation as decided under the land acquisition bill of 2012. They are not interested in the 40:60 land-sharing scheme.“We have seen what happened in the case of Arkavathy Layout. Those who lost land are still suffering. If the land costs around Rs 10 crore, we demand that the government give us Rs 5 crore immediately and put the remaining in banks, so that we can at least earn interest from it,” Raghu said.Many farmers said they are now making a living by selling vegetables and doing odd jobs in the city, as part of their land is infertile and they have no money for labour.The BDA is said to acquire 1,800 acres of land from around 4,000 people.	farmer protest,Bangalore Development Authority,Bengaluru,	 Mar 12 2019
BBMP may hire different vendor for eggs in midday meals	Though dependent on the Akshaya Patra to run its midday meal programme, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is considering asking another private player to supply eggs as a supplement.The chairman of the Palike’s education committee Imran Pasha told DH that adding eggs in the midday meals will meet the nutritional needs of students in BBMP schools and colleges. “The eggs would be provided by another vendor, while the Akshaya Patra foundation would continue to supply the meals,” he said.He said the BBMP has allotted Rs 1 crore for the meals, while funds specifically for the eggs would be set aside after preparing a proposal.The mid-day meals are provided by the Akshaya Patra Foundation to more than 17,000 students in 138 BBMP schools, 14 PU colleges and four Undergraduate colleges in Bengaluru.An Akshaya Patra foundation spokesperson said the organisation would not object to the BBMP procuring eggs from a different vendor and supplying it to the schools.“The Akshaya Patra midday meals programme for schools follows the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) principle of vegetarianism in its cooking. It strictly avoids meat, fish, and eggs,” the spokesperson said.“If the BBMP wants to provide eggs, we will not supply them to the school directly. The school management or concerned authority can procure eggs by other means and provide them to school,” the spokesperson added. Pasha said the eggs will be supplied by a separate vendor.In December, the inclusion of onions and garlic in the Akshaya Patra midday meal programme kicked up controversy even as several NGOs demanded eggs to be added as a supplement.Organisations and a few experts wrote to the Women and Child Development ministry saying including eggs would greatly enhance the nutritional value of the meals supplied to children.

Tibetans observe 60th anniversary of people’s uprising	The Tibetan Parliament-in-exile on Sunday observed the 60th anniversary of their people’s peaceful uprising against the Chinese occupiers of their homeland.To honour the support they received from several countries, including India, Kashag (the highest executive office of the Central Tibetan Administration) designated 2018 as the year of gratitude. It began with ‘thank you, India’ and ended with ‘thank you, America’.To ensure that the Tibetan struggle moves forward, the Kashag on Sunday dedicated 2019 as the year of commitment. The Tibetan Parliament-in-exile urged freedom-loving people to commit to end the oppression in Tibet and fight against impunity.	Tibetean uprising day,Bengaluru,	 Mar 11 2019
Bengalureans lament destruction of green cover	"In the season of blooming, when everybody is sharing photographs of flowering trees in their neighbourhood on social media, there is a large section of people who are concerned about how new projects like the elevated corridor will contribute to the destruction of the remaining green cover of the city.""Through the generations, people have been contributed to maintaining the green cover of the city. Now destroying the trees for projects such as elevated corridor is really depressing,"" says Srinivas Alavilli, member of Citizens for Bengaluru. ""At least with the Metro, thousands of commuters were helped even though trees were felled. But the elevated corridor can only accommodate cars,"" he says.A few nature lovers, who shared the photographs of the season’s blooms on their Facebook walls, felt that ""It is important to contain the city's development and spread out more evenly without losing out its greenery"".""As we see people sharing pictures of trees and flowers they have clicked with love and affection, it is so ironic that we also get to see trees in public spaces being cut down,"" adds Srinivas.""It is our responsibility to protect the green cover. If not, what will we leave for our future generations,"" he asks.With the spring coming early this year the flowering trees in Bengaluru are in full bloom.Now it is the time for the 'Silver Trumpet' tree!In Bengaluru, there are many Silver Trumpet trees, which are mostly found in old Bengaluru areas like Jayanagar, Rajajinagar, Basavanagudi etc.A native of South America 'Tabebuia Argentea' (yellow flowers) is commonly known as the Silver Trumpet tree. The fluorescent yellow flowers are trumpet-shaped with some species having double-layered petals.""The flowering season starts from February and will be on till April. These trees will be in a vegetative for almost 11 years,"" says M Jagadeesh, Joint Director of the Lalbagh Botanical Garden’s Horticulture Department.A Silver Trumpet, planted in Lalbagh Botanical Garden by former prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru during his visit to the city, is in full bloom and it is thanks to the efforts of the Horticulture Department.“With the help of tree surgeries and regular pruning, we are able to keep the plant growth in check and maintain the shape. Also, with the help of a good canopy balance these trees can survive for 50-60 years,” Jagadeesh adds.The tree provides good shade and attracts everyone with its bright yellow blooms. It is surely an attention-getter. Vijay Nishanth, environmentalist and 'tree doctor', shared the pictures of the 'Silver Trumpet' tree on his Facebook wall saying ""Bengaluru streets holds this beautyeverywheree in summer.[sic]"" Nature lovers hope to see the 'Silver Trumpet' in full bloom the next spring too!"	elevated corridor,Bengaluru,Nature,	 Mar 10 2019
26 Whitefield policeman win awards for crime detection	The Whitefield division police have awarded 26 police personnel with Rs 10,000 in cash and four days’ holiday for the best crime detection.Abdul Ahad, DCP Whitefield, said those awarded included police constables and sub-inspectors who used exemplary skills and interest in detecting criminal cases.

Pvt-aided school teachers to lose pay over poor results	In a move that will come as a shock for teachers in private-aided schools, the state government has decided to hold them responsible for poor student performance. As per the new rules, the Department of Education can hold teachers’ promotion and salaries besides annulling the grant-in-aid if a newly recruited teacher fails to ensure more than 60% result. Permitting management of the schools to fill vacant posts, the government has cautioned that if freshly recruited teachers fail to ensure good results in their respective subjects, not only their salaries and promotions will be withheld but their grant-in-aid will also be annulled if they continue with their dismal performance for three consecutive years. In the corresponding five years, if 50% of students in aided schools do not pass, grants to these schools would be withheld. According to the order, teachers have to ensure 60% results, failing which that year’s salary would be withheld. The Deputy Directors of Public Instruction have been asked to submit a detailed report on teachers and their performance every year. According to the state government, until 2015, the government had permitted to fill as many as 3,633 vacant teachers’ posts in private-aided schools. However, going by the government’s diktat - that only schools with more than 60 per cent result or on par with the average result of the district be allowed to fill the posts - aided private schools were able to fill only 781 seats. In fact, this condition had triggered an intense debate in the Legislative Council and the government was under due pressure to relax the rules. But according to teachers’ representatives, the latest results have turned out to be even more stringent.Commenting on the move, BJP MLC Arun Shahpur said, “This will create job insecurity among teachers. The government has relaxed one norm and added another five. This is nothing but slow poison for aided schools.” Niranjanaradhya V P, Fellow, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), termed this as the last resort for the government. “They cannot have a discriminatory attitude. There are several private and government schools as well who are not up to the mark. Before you punish anyone for performance, it is your responsibility to create an enabling environment for them to perform,” he said. Terming employment is a matter of social security, he said, “You cannot just hire and fire. Relaxations of the previous norms are bad. The onus is on the institution and management to perform. It is wrong to punish individuals.”	Education,	 Mar 10 2019
BDA hands over 240 flats to Canara Bank	The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) on Friday made its first bulk allotment of flats to Canara Bank.After nearly six months of talks and negotiations, 240 flats in Phase 6 of Valagerahalli were allotted to the bank employees. Bank managers handed over a cheque of Rs 101.45 crore to BDA Commissioner Rakesh Singh.“This is the first bulk allotment done by the BDA. With this, there is hope that more such sales will happen,” said Vinay G Sugur, engineer officer, BDA.“The BDA is in talks with many other companies and banks, but things are yet to materialise,” said a BDA official. “Discussions were going on for very long because of the pricing with Canara Bank. But the BDA has handed over the flats at the cost of Rs 42 lakh each. This, however, does not include the registration charges and possession of the flats will be given by the end of March, once money is deposited to BDA account and after all procedures are completed.” All flats under Phase-6 of Volegerahalli come in two bedroom-hall-kitchen configuration. The BDA constructed three blocks, with each comprising 120 flats. Canara Bank has occupied two blocks, and in the third block 30 flats have been sold to individuals.Flats in Volegerahalli are most sought-after. The BDA has created six phases and all of them have been sold out. Under Phase-5, 415 three BHK flats were constructed and all sold out only recently.

Bengaluru is most forgetful: Uber lost and found index	"For the third time in a row, Bengaluru is the most forgetful city in the country. This year, Bengaluru is followed by New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata, as per the Uber Index. A study by cab-aggregator Uber revealed riders have forgotten live fish, milk sachets, prams, ukulele, bunch of banana, aluminium storage shelf, yoga mat, knee pad, and even sarees, in 2018.""Over the last year, we've seen objects including phones, cameras and bags top the list of items left in Ubers across India, followed by utility items like wallets, keys, clothing, and umbrellas rounding off the top ten,"" it said.Besides leaving 'the usuals' like bags and phones, other items like knee pads, gold chains, baby prams, ukuleles, and live fish as well, it added.Other items include personal hotspot devices, toy cars, footwear (Crocs), while the other common items that people frequently leave behind include glasses, water bottle and phone charger.Afternoon siestas seem to be the most at fault leading to forgetfulness, with the data revealing most such instances happen between 1-3 PM, while weekends emerged as the most common days.In 2018, the most forgetful days were September 1, followed by June 9, September 2, July 15 and September 8.The company, which operates in 15 cities and counts on India as one of the biggest markets globally, however, did not reveal the quantum of instances of forgetfulness.Riders can trace their misplaced objects by selecting that trip and the 'I lost an item' option in the app, it said."

Alert at airports leads to long queues at KIA	Just recovering from the fog and Aero India-related flight disruptions, the Kempegowda International Airport is witnessing long queues yet again, but for a different reason: elaborate security checks triggered by a high alert following the Indo-Pak aerial showdown.The queues at the country’s third busiest airport are widespread, with passengers forced to stand for long hours at the baggage and security screening gates. Stressed over this, many travellers are taking to social media to vent their frustration.Ananth Sampath, a passenger, observed that he had to take off his shoe and belt at the security check. “I have not seen this in India before. Guess they need to buffer additional time at the airports. One hour is not enough,” he tweeted.The stress levels have gone up not only for passengers, but for the airlines and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) as well. “Tickets, too, have become more expensive due to cancelled flights,” noted another passenger, Mathew Thomas.The airport operator, Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) had this to say: “Access control at all gates of the airport have been tightened and the screening intensified. There were slight delays due to intense passenger screening, but all within acceptable limits.” On Saturday, the Centre had directed all airports and airlines in the country to enhance the existing security measures. Issuing the alert, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) had marked it to senior police officials of all states, in-charges of security at all airlines and airports and CISF officers.The alert applied to all civil aviation installations such as airports, airstrips, airfields, air force stations, helipads, flying schools and aviation training institutes. Twenty specific enhanced security measures were cited to be in operation until further orders.Enhanced screening of passengers meant a 100% full pat-down search at pre-embarkation security checkpoints.The BCAS directive also required enhanced random screening of the airport staff and visitors at the main entrance to the terminal building.Even before the alert, long security queues have been an issue at KIA. BIAL had introduced the Automatic Tray Retrieval System (ATRS) to speed up the screening process.	Kempegowda International Airport,alert,	 Mar 07 2019
Ride-sharing only way out of chaos: Drivers’ union	The government should make it mandatory for IT companies to hire buses for employees’ transportation, which will boost ridesharing and ease traffic congestion in Whitefield and Electronic City, taxi drivers have said.The Indian Vehicle Drivers’ Union has appealed to Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy to address the issue.“There are 6,500 IT-BT and IT-enabled companies in Bengaluru. Approximately 15 lakh people are employed in these companies,” said Gandasi Sadananda Swamy, president of the union. “While they are contributing to the economy, the city’s limited infrastructure is leading to traffic problems due to abnormal growth in number of vehicles. Ride-sharing is the only solution for the problem.” The union also said that several IT companies had stopped “day trips” and instead were giving travel allowance to their employees. “Companies are giving Rs 5,000 transport charges (allowance) to employees, which is encouraging them to use own vehicles. Instead, they should embrace cost-effective solutions like hiring buses for a particular number of trips,” he said.The drivers’ union said that congestion was directly affecting their revenue because of delayed trips, while the increasing amount of time spent on the road was affecting their health. The union has suggested that the government make it compulsory for companies to hire BMTC buses.M R Kori, president of Whitefield Area Commerce and Industries Association, said the government should encourage IT firms to hire buses. “They should start by encouraging them and then make it compulsory. Ride-sharing is the best solution within the limited infrastructure,” he said.“Though many know the problems, they may not be aware of the solutions. We will conduct a meeting with members of our group and start a discussion in this regard,” he said.	Public Transport,IT companies,ride-sharing,	 Mar 07 2019

Bringing world’s folktales to city kids	Tikki Tikki Tembo might sound like the rhythmic beat of a reggae number, but it is actually a popular Chinese folktale.As Shylaja Sampath narrates the tale animatedly at a Banashankari park, children seated around her watch with wide-eyed wonderment and a slight smile.Tikki Tikki Tembo, which tells why the Chinese names are short today, is among the most popular tales of the storyteller.“Storytelling is one art that is rapidly gaining popularity in the city,” Shylaja says, talking about her initiative ‘Stories in the Park’ through which she tells popular folktales across the globe with the flourish of a performance artist.Each month, she conducts the storytelling session at the Banashankari park that has brought children and adults alike. Shylaja brings stories to life by blending narration with performance. She has been a storyteller and a theatre person for the past 20 years, and so the skill is almost second nature.At the end of each story, she teaches children folksongs related to the origin of the story she narrated. The wide array of stories from Japan to Bengal is a treat to both their eyes and ears.“The best thing is, everyone has their own takeaway from these stories; their own perception about them. This’s beautiful,” she says.Storytelling is not restricted to children. Shylaja holds sessions for the adults that draw their subjects from short stories of famous authors like Rabindranath Tagore.“Children may find it harder to interpret those stories,” she says. “For children, it’s always the folktales from India and other countries, besides stories from children’s authors.”Shylaja is also the founder of Ninety Bold Tales, a performance art-based collective. She brings parents and children together with interactive methods, encouraging them to learn through storytelling.	Folklore,Storytellers,	 Mar 06 2019
Lalbagh vehicle ban hits project roadblock	Change of guard at the Horticulture directorate in Lalbagh has put the department’s ambitious plan to make the sprawling botanical gardens a ‘Walkers’ Paradise’ on the back-burner.The horticulture department had planned to enforce a complete ban on the movement of vehicles, including vehicles belonging to the horticulture department, inside the gardens. However, the project, despite support from the horticulture minister, has still remained on paper.A complete ban on movement of vehicles inside the park was one of the demands put forward by walkers and joggers during ‘Janaspandana’— a citizen interaction programme organised by Deccan Herald and Prajavani on November 26. Citizens wanted visitors and officials to walk or move around using a battery operated vehicle.The move had the backing of both officials and Horticulture minister M C Managuli, who expressed his support for the use of buggies.The previous director of horticulture, Y S Patil, had assured that the plan will be put in place in about one month with the purchase of buggies. However, even after a month, there is no sign of proposal seeing light of day. Officials at the horticulture directorate revealed to DH that the project has stalled due to change of guard at the department level.A few weeks ago, the state government transferred horticulture director YS Patil as Deputy Commissioner of Vijayapura and posted Dr M V Venkatesh as the director of the horticulture department.“The new director has taken charge recently and is briefed about the pending projects. We will also brief him about the problems raised by public, walkers and joggers and soon a ban on vehicles will be ordered as suggested by the minister,” a senior official from Lalbagh said.Meanwhile, the department has also hiked the entry fees to the gardens with effect from March 1. The entry and parking fee have been increased by Rs 5 to Rs 10 over and above the existing fee across various categories.	Horticulture Department,Lalbagh,Vehicle ban,	 Mar 06 2019
Here’s how a group of climbers can inspire you to hike	The city may be well-known for its music scene, but rarely mentioned is the passion for rock climbing and the opportunities hikers find in the nearby hills.Among the passionate group of trekkers is ‘The Climbing Project’, which inspires people to get outdoors and in the middle of nature. They invite many to explore the Turahalli forests, Ravugodlu and other scenic areas that also promise a good workout for the body.And what more, the group encourages those taking part in their programmes to let their Labradors and Great Danes to tramp along in their trekking expeditions. The group mainly holds workshops for people of all ages to prepare them to climb the toughest of terrains from boulders to hills. “The Project also wants to make climbing accessible for everyone,” its co-founder Saurabh Chauhan told DH.“Unlike other sports, climbing requires several equipments not so easily available in India and the ones available are expensive,” he said, adding that the project is aiming to buy the equipments for the use of the climbers. The gear can be bought from the funds raised out of workshops.As a sport, climbing is liberating; it enhances focus, strength and flexibility.“Climbing has different forms,” Chauhan explained. This includes, among other things, bouldering, sport climbing done in teams of two with protective ropes and bolts, traditional climbing on cracks in the terrain with removable gears.Beginning in 2017, the project has already trained 500 people in various forms of climbing.They host climbing adventures each weekend around the city, besides organising climbing trips once a month to Hampi, Mysuru and other places.

Green warriors, CSR funds come to Nandi Hills' rescue	An ongoing green initiative has helped revive ponds and lakes as well as increase green cover in Nandi Hills in the last three years.The Nandi Lake and Pataala Ganga have been revived through the untiring efforts of former IFS officer and noted environmentalist AN Yellappa Reddy’s Bangalore Environment Trust and the United Way Bengaluru - both of whom have used CSR funds to rejuvenate water bodies as part of the “Save Nandi Hills campaign”.According to a report on the campaign’s activities, Nandi Lake was in terrible shape, with uncontrolled removal of soil and dumping of waste and debris virtually destroying the lake.The NGO along with the district administration and zilla panchayat took up a scientific study to revive the lake. The feeder canals blocked for several years were cleared and rainwater was allowed to flow into the lake.Apart from that, kalyanis (small ponds) were also revived. One such kalyani, Paataala Ganga, was choked with silt. So, the feeder canals were cleaned and water is now flowing into the Paataala Ganga, which is now raising the water level up in the Amrut Sarovara. To enhance bio-diversity, tree plantation drives and seed ball throwing initiatives were also carried out.The fertile red soil, manure and cow dung was used to make the seed balls by engaging volunteers from various companies.Drastic changeAbout 2,000 saplings of native fruit and flower-bearing species have been planted since the campaign began. This has also discouraged the proliferation of eucalyptus, which is known to be harmful to soil and water.Speaking about the rejuvenation project, Special Officer to Nandi Hills, Ramesh N, said that a drastic change could be seen ever since the activities began.“Although the government allocates funds for improving and maintaining Nandi Hills, it is not enough especially with the manpower crisis. The volunteers come in hundreds, take up the task and finish it. More than funds, it the scientific method and the huge number of volunteers that is making the difference here,” Ramesh added.About 70 acres of Nandi Hills is controlled and maintained by the Horticulture department, while the remaining 3,500 acres of land is under the forest department.

We proved them wrong: Team Tarini	The team of Six Indian Navy women called Tarini, the first Asian team to circumnavigate the globe in eight months, interacted with Mount Carmel college students.It was a part of National Geographics’s #GirlsWhoSailed initiative, ahead of International Women’s Day.Just like the sail, the crew comprising Lieutenant (Lt) Commander Pratibha Jamwal, Lt Commander Aishwarya Boddapati, Lt Commander P Swathi, Lt Commander S Vijaya Devi and Lt Payal Gupta, was lead by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi (skipper).“We never lost hope and never wanted to quit. We faced resistance from our parents and concerned senior colleagues. They said we might never return. But we proved them all wrong,” said the women crew. “This is the message we want to give everyone, especially women…that we are equal. Capabilities are important. The sea does not know male or female. It will not differentiate. Nothing in the world can stop us, if we decide,” they added.A film ‘Tarini’ has also been made chronicling their journey known as ‘Navika Sagar Parikrama’.On September 10, 2017, the team took off from Goa. Their gruel voyage of 254 days covering 21,622 nautical miles ended on March 21, 2018.The team recounted their two storms of 20 hours each. The worst being the one they encountered in the Southern Hemisphere, close to Antarctica, called the Graveyard of Ships. The speed of the storm was 200 kmph against boat’s speed of 6-12 kmph.The crew recollected their experience in temperatures of 45 degree Celsius, 15 degree Celsius, zero degree Celsius and -7 degree Celsius.They recalled how they cut Chocowalnut cake when they crossed the Equator at 4.50 am, as a ritual to King Neptune, and sang Happy Equator song (reprised version). They recollected how they would touch earth each time they landed on ports and some lighter moments of fights and birthdays.Lt Commander Swathi said unlike solo circumnavigations, they had each other. The team drew inspiration from their trainer and first solo (2009) circum-navigator Dilip Done.“But it was difficult to leave families and others behind on this long voyage, especially for me as I was the only one who was married. We not only built a bond among ourselves, but also with the boat as we saw it getting built from a price of wood,” she said.	National Geographic,Tarini,Mount Carmel College,	 Mar 02 2019
Govt plans to modify guidelines to regularise houses 	The state government on Thursday hinted at modification of guidelines for regularisation of houses in BBMP limits under Akrama-Sakrama scheme, in an apparent move to woo members of low income groups ahead of the forthcoming Lok Sabh polls.“The coalition government will consider modification of guidelines under Akrama-Sakrama scheme for properties falling within the 18-km radius of BBMP limits,” said Revenue Minister R V Deshpande.He was speaking at a function to issue possession certificates to over 10,000 beneficiaries.Deshpande said that the government itself hads completed property registration process to avoid inconvenience to beneficiaries.The Revenue department had digitised the entire process to ensure transparency. Last date to obtain possession certificates under 94C of Karnataka State Land Revenue Act (KSLRA) had been extended till March 31, he said.Deshpande said that the government would issue cultivation slip to farmers cultivating government lands outside BBMP limits.The process of disposing applications relating to bagair hukum lands has been speeded up, he added. Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy said that the government had received several representations seeking possession certificates to people who had constructed houses illegally in the BBMP limits, and the request would be looked into.The government had already transferred 1,600 acre land to construct group houses in the BBMP limits. While the state and the Central governments would contribute Rs 1.5 lakh for each beneficiary, the beneficiary contribution will be Rs one lakh.	akrama-sakrama,guidelines for low income groups,	 Mar 01 2019
BIFFES 2019: Hattrick will sweep you off your feet	The organisers of the 11th Edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival picked Iran as the focus country and the audience couldn't get enough of the films from the region. Not only were a variety of films showcased from Iran, but viewers also braved long lines to catch most of them. Hattrick, a film by Ramtin Lavafi, was one such film which saw a packed theatre. The film had the audience rapt in attention and also evoked from them apt reactions. From the 'oohs' to 'wow' and even whistles. Hattrick is a film that tells a story, creates immense mystery, has light moments and yet is simple. The simplicity lies in the film's narration. Set in not more than three to four locations, the entire film travels deep into the characters' lives. As the story unravels, the audience will feel the shock, sadness and joy along with Farzad (Amir Jadidi), his wife Lida (Parinaz Izadyar), their friend Keivan (Saber Abar) and his girlfriend Raha (Mahoor Alvand).The main plot of Hattrick begins with the four friends on their way to their homes from a party when Farzad, who is driving, hits something or someone, yet chooses to drive away. They are engulfed with worry, guilt and even anger. What follows is just discussion that leads from one thing to another and brings in focus some uncomfortable truths and hypocrisy of the characters. But Hattrick is not your everyday thriller which will keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Rather, it is an entertaining piece of cinema which conveys some serious messages without creating any tension. Like a funny instance when Lida, who is tired of husband's immaturity, keeps storming away from him in anger, and each of the time, Farzad quips- 'She will return'. Those instances were greeted with laughter by the audience, but all it showed was how Farzad had taken Lida for granted amidst all his follies and childish decisions. In fact, Amir Jadidi and Parinaz Izadyar play their characters to such perfection that even though one will find Farzad's emotions childlike and beautiful, we hope Lida never returns to Farzad (keep an eye out for the scene where Farzad is engrossed in TV while in the background Raha and Keivan are involved in a serious discussion)At times, films that have nothing but only conversations tend to move at a slow pace, but not Hattrick. With every conversation, the audience is clueless if it will be a serious revelation or a fun, everyday joke. Either of the two will definitely keep you glued to your seats till the very end. All four main actors win every scene that is beautifully placed by Lavafi. Lavafi not only speaks volumes with small scenes, but he is successful in creating a lasting impression on the audience's mind with this masterpiece. Hattrick is a no-miss and totally worth a shot!Hattrick will be screened at the BIFFES 2019 on February 28, Thursday at 4:20 pm at Screen 5.	Cinema,Film festival,Biffes 2019,BIFFES,Iran,	 Feb 27 2019
BIFFES 2019: Great cinema, serpentine lines on weekend	"On the third day of the 11th Edition of the Bengaluru International Film festival, visitors turned up in large numbers and had an exciting line-up of film to catch up on. According to the Artistic Director of BIFFes, N Vidhyashankar, the weekend saw almost 15 to 20 thousand visitors thronging the PVR to watch a film. Among almost 50 national, international and regional films a serpentine line was seen for films like The Guilty (from Denmark), Ranganayaki (a classic Ambareesh starrer Kannada film ) and 3 faces (from Iran) among several others on the third day of the festival. Amidst the craze for these critically acclaimed films, visitors also found joy in finding out that food at the PVR cinema was served at slashed prices. ""The food prices are cut by almost 70%. We have picked the best selling food and cut down the prices for the visitors. The organisers want people to enjoy the festival to the fullest,"" a PVR staff said. DH caught up with some of the visitors for their verdict on the first three days of the festival. ""I did not come here on the first day, but the last two days have indeed felt like a festival,"" Dhruv, a literature student said. He rushed from one screen to another to watch films that he had been waiting for. ""I wanted to watch The Burning (a South Korean film) but missed it because my friend wanted to watch The Wild Pear Tree. And then I caught with Shoplifters (a Japanese film). later on, in the day I managed to watch two more films, not fully though,"" Dhruv says who walked out of the screen before the films ended so that he could watch other films. Though the visitors realise it is practically impossible to watch all the movies scheduled, they did not expect the crowd that welcomed them at every screen. Like Raagini P, a corporate communications executive had planned to watch The Guilty but had to settle for The Realm owing to a long line and filled the theatre. ""I think the BIFFes has attracted an amazing response. It is also the weekend crowd but not something I expected,"" Raagini says. Her friend, Sneha, a content writer agrees about the crowd and suggests multiple screenings of some of the popular films might help ease the crowd. ""Some popular films are lined up at the same time, maybe they could be screened again,"" she says. ""They could also create a list of 'hist-list' of films the visitors could watch. Many of them are clueless about what to watch,"" Sneha adds.However, Raagini and Sneha like several others have no complaints about the kind of the genre of the scheduled films. ""The list caters to all kinds of film enthusiasts. I think it is a good mixture of all kinds of films,"" Raagini says. They also have a suggestion to tackle the problem of visitors waiting in long lines for a film, but ending up reaching the door to a filled theatre. ""A facility to book slots online might solve so many problems. it will also give an idea to visitors and the organisers about the footfall,"" Raagini says. ""The energy here is amazing. I love everything about the BIFFes except for the long line. Maybe next year they should have more venues to screen the films. Though a single venue is great, it is small for the number of people,"" Preeti, a techie said. Sharath Kumar, a software professional feels it is natural and visitors should have patience. ""The quality of films, the variety and the convenience of being in one venue are the positives of BIFFes. Naturally, several people will come to enjoy the experience. We have to enjoy even the long lines, be civil in it and savour the fruit of patience- the films,"" he says."	Film festival,Biffes 2019,BIFFES,	 Feb 24 2019
"@KarachiBakery tweets ""Absolutely Indian"" by heart"	"Two days after the iconic Karachi Bakery in Indiranagar in East Bengaluru was in the spotlight after a group of ""patriots"" came and threatened to take out the name ""Karachi,"" the Hyderabad based Karachi Bakery clarified on Saturday that it was ""absolutely Indian.""In a tweet @KarachiBakery, it said ""We would like to clarify that Karachi Bakery was founded by Shri. Khanchand Ramnani, who migrated to India during the partition. The brand was established in 1953 and is an Indian company based out of Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The popularity and love for its products has contributed to its growth throughout India and abroad. The essence of Karachi Bakery is absolutely Indian by heart and will remain so. We request everybody to refrain from any kind of misconceptions.""#KarachiBakery pic.twitter.com/S5KHB7Nm0b— Karachi Bakery (@KarachiBakery) February 23, 2019Sections of the media reported even other outlets of Karachi Bakery in Bengaluru have also received threatening calls since February 17 from groups demanding that the firm should change its name or shut down the business, employees said. Employees at the company’s Mahadevapura outlet said that they had complained to the police about the calls.Nine people have been arrested by the Indiranagar police who have been booked for unlawful assembly, and criminal breach of trust. Among the nine, seven of them claimed that they were all social workers and were ""patriots"" locally, the police quoted them as saying.Meanwhile, the East division police also claim that they have been receiving calls stating the arrested men have affiliations with Right-wing outfits.Around 20 men, on Friday, had barged into the bakery and questioned as to why the bakery had such a name and also demanded to know who the owner was. However, they did not resort to damage property. The bakery staff had called the police after which they covered the word “Karachi” from the signage and even put a national flag in front of the bakery. The Indiranagar police have put up picketing near the outlet and other sensitive areas in the East division to avert such instances."	Karachi Bakery,Indiranagar,Bengaluru,	 Feb 24 2019
Being Kashmiri in Bengaluru, in aftermath of Pulwama	"Within minutes of the ghastly terror attack at Lethpora in Pulwama, I got a call from my dad, who is currently camping in Srinagar. The tone was dejected, and very worried – a concern for my well-being in distant Bengaluru.“Furquan, be extra cautious, sentiments are going to be high. Don't engage with anyone and make sure the rest of the family is also safe,"" he said.In pursuit of my daily story, I brushed away my father's concerns thinking he had fallen prey to the hysteria. And I had a reason for that -- I have called Bengaluru my home for years and it's my home and my identity. And I have never felt unwanted, much less hated, or unsafe here so far.MUST READ | Full Coverage on Pulwama Terror AttackThe next morning, when the nation was engrossed in the tragedy that had taken the lives of over 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans, everything seemed to be normal. But within hours of the cabinet committee on security (CCS) meeting, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was speaking at the inauguration of Vande Bharat Express, his words at the public gathering in Varanasi sent shivers down my spine. ""Iss hamle ki vajah se desh mein jitna aakrosh hai, logon ka khoon khol raha hai; ye main bhalibhaanti samajh pa raha hoon. Iss samay jo desh ki apekshaen hain, kuchh kar guzarne ki bhavanaen hain, vo bhi s‍vabhavik hain. (The rage in the country due to this attack is making the blood of the people boil; I understand this very well. At this time, there is also the feeling that something needs to be done. That’s also natural).”If my dad could anguish about what could be a ‘natural’ response to such a gruesome terror attack, the Prime Minister of 130 crore people, I thought, would also have an idea of it. Surprisingly, there was no appeal to maintain communal harmony at such a time -- and one still hasn’t come!Soon after the prime minister’s speech, a glimpse at Twitter feeds showed that my dad’s concerns no longer seemed so misplaced as it had earlier. It was not just Pakistan that was the target of hatred and anger, but also Kashmiri Muslims. Twitter was filled with comments spewing venom on the community. Former Infosys CFO and Modi’s camp follower T V Mohandas Pai tweeted: ""Kashmiri Shops in Tourists Spots -- Is there more than what meets the eye? Are such shops becoming money-laundering outfits? Needs investigation, worrisome"".In his tweet, Pai tagged Modi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, while quoting a link from Sanjeev Nayyar, who in an article on May 1, 2018, had tried to normalise the rape of a young Bakkarwal girl from Kathua. It is surprising that despite the backlash on Pai's tweet, none of the ministers tagged have taken cognizance of it and come out with an appeal for calm.Social media is helping amplify anger and hate. The effects are evident on the streets. I am personally witnessing it. The security guard outside my home in Bengaluru who till three days ago used to greet me cheerfully every day had nothing but a cold, hateful stare in store for me. The driver of an autorickshaw I was travelling in was fine until he heard me talking over the phone in Kashmiri. His attitude changed immediately. The immediate, although not life-threatening consequence was a demand for Rs 20 more over the meter-fare. The man knew I could not afford to pick up a fight over it with him, now that I had exposed myself as a Kashmiri. I paid up without a murmur.Among the experiences of my Kashmiri friends, one sent me an SOS when her accommodation in a serviced apartment in a posh locality in Bengaluru got cancelled. The real estate agent sent her the following message: ""We will not provide the apartment to you and you know the reason"".In another case, a group of Kashmiri students pursuing graduate studies in the city was threatened, after a fellow Kashmiri college-mate, whose behaviour they had no connection with, put up a highly insensitive Facebook post over the February 14 terror attack.As I began to see the hate poison spreading, I tweeted: ""My heart and home are open to anyone in need of help. Please feel free to message me"". There was nothing political or communal in that tweet, but the right-wing Twitterati had to barge in. ""U mean any Muslim in need of help,"" replied one Kailash Chatterjee; another, by the Twitter, handle name of Daniel Semah tweeted: ""Say people who raped and butchered thousands of KPs in cold blood.""Pardon my ignorance, but which among us Kashmiri Muslims have ""raped and butchered thousands of KPs in cold blood"". Not that I need to prove it to anyone, but I have been closer to Kashmiri Pandits than to Kashmiri Muslims for the most part of my life so far. The hate messages are not dying down with time, they are being ratcheted up in a calibrated manner even as the prime minister went from “I can understand people’s blood is boiling” on day 1 of the tragedy to “My blood is boiling” on day 3. So much so that I’m beginning to sweat at the thought of having to leave home for work. That, thousands of miles away from Kashmir, in Bengaluru."	Jammu and Kashmir,Pulwama Attack,CRPF,	 Feb 18 2019
Father awaits missing son at the Majestic parking lot	A 50-year-old father has been waiting for his 14-year-old son at the Kempegowda Bus Station for the past two days.B S Nikhil left after parking his bicycle, informing the guard to take care of it until he returns from Hyderabad in three days.Nikhil, a 9th standard student of Carmel School in Padmanabhanagar, left his house on February 15, after his mother told him to do better in studies.Nikhil’s father B Srinivasulu, a businessman and a resident of Bhuvaneshwari Nagar in Banashankari III stage, searched for Nikhil everywhere soon after. He visited the houses of Nikhil’s friends. Finally, one of Nikhil’s classmates told Srinivasulu that Nikhil was upset about his mother’s words.Nikhil is not able to focus on studies, so he decided to leave the house and go to Hyderabad to do some odd jobs, the classmate told Srinivasulu.Thereafter, Srinivasulu rushed to the City Railway Station and searched for the bicycle and inquired about Nikhil, showing his photograph around.The guard there told Srinivasulu that Nikhil had indeed visited the station and as the parking was expensive there, he decided to go the Kempegowda Bus Station and park there instead.Also, there were not many trains to Hyderabad at that time, the guard told the boy’s father. Srinivasulu then got hold of CCTV footage of Nikhil on his bicycle in the Majestic area. After visiting the Kempegowda Bus Station’s parking, Srinivasulu found Nikhil’s bicycle there.The guard at the station told Srinivasulu that the boy bargained for Rs 200 for three days parking, and said he was going to Hyderabad, to return in three days.Now, Srinivasulu is waiting for Nikhil at the bus station’s parking lot, hoping that his son would return home.

Protest against ‘anti-student’ policies held in City 	Students, teachers, lawyers, academics and rights activists from different groups and walks of life assembled together at Town Hall here on Saturday evening to protest against the Central Government’s ‘anti-student’ education policies and to extend solidarity to the ‘Dilli Chalo’ movement. The programme began with a prayer and a minute of silence to pay respect to the soldiers who lost their lives in the Pulwama terror attack. Then, there were several speeches, slogans, songs and colourful placards that proclaimed their interest to ‘stop the communalisation, centralisation and commercialisation’ of education in India.Explaining to DH the reason for holding such a protest, Neenu Suresh, a research scholar of National Law School (NLS) and a member of the Bengaluru Collective, who along with the student group called the Student Outpost (TSO) organised the protest, said that their aim was to originally hold a seminar but then felt the need to protest to give students a voice.“It’s not actually a sudden thing and as we know in Karnataka, there is a limitation on student unions and protests here. So this meeting becomes all the more important. When students across the country have been protesting for the past five years against many different government measures such as slashing of scholarships, cutting of research grants and plans of scrapping the UGC, students of Bengaluru, which has many premier institutions of the country, felt that they must come out and show solidarity with other student struggles,” she argued.Shalom, an organising member of the TSO, also addressed the crowd whose composition included a wide range of local institutions and urged the students of Bengaluru to pull together to overturn the ban on student unions.“We, the students of Bengaluru, are afraid of politics and are apathetic to it. No student unions are allowed to represent our interests even though we have nominated councils that organise our college festivals. Until we don’t demand and ask our college management to grant us our rights, how do we expect to fight the government on bigger questions of justice? I urge you all to go back to your colleges and demand revocation of the student union ban,” said Shalom.When questioned, other students cited other instances of government policies that prompted them to attend such an event.“Communalisation of education is attacking the very basis of knowledge and we have seen the willful distortion of history by the present government, which is encouraging dangerous trends such as Islamophobia and Casteism,” said Ardra, a 23-year-old student.Suvarat, a researcher at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), meanwhile, lamented that the fact the current government has not delivered on its promises on education. “They had pledged 6% GDP spending on education in their manifesto but what we saw was less than 3% in 2018. The other issue is that with increased privatisation, as is the case with the US where publicly taxpayer-funded research will continue to create breakthroughs but the profits and benefits will be passed on to the private players,” he argued.	protest,Bengaluru,	 Feb 17 2019
‘Pakodanomics’ & jobs discussed at meet on employment	‘Pakodanomics’, the right to work, unemployment data and student protests and movements were some of the themes on which students raised questions as they put their youth political leaders on the hot seat during a public meet on employment issues held here on Saturday. A packed hall of students in Gandhi Bhavan’s Bapu Hall in Kumara Park kicked things off in the morning with political songs as they welcomed Gururaj Desai from the Student Federation of India (SFI), Surabhi Dwivedi from the National Students' Union of India (NSUI) and Ashish Chauhan from Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) to start the first panel discussion.Asha Kotwal of the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch (AIDMAM), the moderator of the first session, began the discussion by asking the speakers to express their views on the recent row over the ‘leaked’ National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) data which has pegged India’s unemployment rate at 6.1% during the 2017-2018 period.In her opening remarks, Surabhi from NSUI condemned the government for its attempt at data suppression and asserted that the youth of the country is frustrated and “fed-up” with the government’s “fake promises”. “We have a Prime Minister who advocates for Pakodanomics. At the risk of being charged for sedition, I’d like to ask, How’s the josh? Where are the jobs?” she questioned. However, Chauhan retorted by underplaying the issue as he argued that the problem of unemployment is not unique to us and is happening all over the world. “We are debating one report which is not even officially released yet. If you see the International Labor Organisation (ILO) reports, it has pegged the official unemployment rate at around 3.6-3.7 %. Our economic growth in the past five years has been tremendous while inflation has halved. Meanwhile, there are crores of jobs that have been created according to EPF data. We can further improve the employment situation by implementing the Kothari Commission recommendations and strengthening Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas of ‘Bunyadi’ (Foundational) education,” asserted Chauhan. Ashish’s statistics were then rebutted by Desai of SFI who claimed that according to central government data, 1.15 crore youth pass out of colleges every year but only around 5 Lakh manage to find employment.“Instead of adding employment to education and healthcare, the Modi government is experimenting with us through contractual employment wherein temporary workers with no job security get paid half of what the permanent workers are paid for doing for the same amount of work. Modi and Rahul Gandhi have both made a lot of statements and though ‘surgical strikes’, ‘acche din’ and ‘beti bachao’ are catchy slogans, the youth shouldn’t be swayed,“ he argued. During the question-answer round with the students, speakers were questioned about how their political parties plan to improve the employment situation in India. Dwivedi from NSUI said that some suggestions by Congress in light of upcoming elections included advocating for creating a student right’s commission on the lines of the national women’s commission and granting of unemployment allowances while Desai argued for employment to be guaranteed and strengthened as a fundamental right. The audience also broke into raucous laughter at one point during the Q & A when Chauhan from NSUI was asked by a student as to when PM Modi will be sending Rs 15 Lakh to his bank account and when the Ganga will be cleaned. Chauhan responded to the question by saying that the government is making efforts to bring back illicit cash that is stashed abroad. He then asserted that the Ganga has been cleaned which again invited hysterical laughter from the crowd. “I went to Prayagraj on the occasion of Vasant Panchami and I assure you that you can take a dip at the Triveni Sangam. Why are Siberian birds coming back to India after decades? Did PM Modi send them Visas?” he asked. Another panel discussion on student movements was also held post lunch. The panel discussions were organized by Azim Premji University’s Centre for Sustainable Employment and Samvada, a collective that works on youth issues.	ABVP,Unemployment,NSUI,	 Feb 17 2019
Antinatalists gather in B'luru; pledge child-free life	"Antinatalism is gradually gaining ground in the city. As many as 40 people came together on Sunday morning calling upon the public to opt for a child-free life.Members of Child-Free India gathered in front of the Mantri Mall, Malleswaram and pledged a child-free life. Stating that procreation was wrong, the antinatalists said human misery could be avoided if people simply did not exist in the first place.Pratima Naik, an engineering graduate from Bengaluru who helped to make the group's first national meet a reality, said those born into our miserable world are doomed to suffer. According to her, new people are also capable of inflicting pain on the rest.""Being born means to suffer, as well as feeling pleasure. But the foregoing of pleasure is not as bad as the presence of suffering. Therefore, it is nothing but ideal for humanity to stop reproducing and go extinct,"" she said.Prasanth, another member of the group, said the participants told everyone why they were opting for a child-free life and the reasons for the same.""Humans are creating a lot of problems for themselves and other species. More humans will accelerate the degradation of society and the environment,” he said.Pratima has created a Facebook page - Child-free India - with more than 380 followers. The page carries regular posts on antinatalism.Sunday's meet is part of a series of preparatory events to make antinatalism popular. The meeting ended with the committee drafting a set of resolutions that will provide a basis for the movement to convince young people who are willing to think deeper about issues related to life and suffering.In a release, the group said a core team has been formed to decide how to expand the network by spreading awareness in various metros."

Jakkur Lake to be surveyed for studying encroachment	"The BBMP will do a survey of the Jakkur Lake to determine if there are encroachments by a private builder.People living close to the lake have complained that the private builder is constructing a building in the lake's buffer zone, prompting Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun to inspect the waterbody on Thursday.In a letter to the BBMP commissioner, the mayor asked him to depute the revenue DC to do the survey and determine whether the private construction is an encroachment on the lake and whether it would harm the waterbody.During the inspection, residents living near the lake complained that the sewage water from the treatment plant is allowed into the borewells in the area.Manjunath (name changed) said: ""Construction activities are going on for the past couple of weeks inside the lake's buffer zone limits. Officials need to check if NGT rules are violated."" He also said the sewage water coming out of the STP unit is mixing with the borewell water. ""The sewage water is entering homes,"" he added.After listening to the complaints, the mayor said it is not clear whether the NGT rules are violated due to the lake's current situation.""The Bangalore Development Authority handed over the lake to the Palike in 2015 after development works. Also, 41 of 161 acres was handed over to the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board to build the STP and to create wetland,"" she said.""There's no clarity on the buffer zone rules on BWSSB. The building work is right now taking place at the area handed over to the BWSSB. I’ll hold a meeting with both the BDA and BWSSB and resolve the issue,"" Gangambike assured.Deputy Mayor B Bhadregowda, ruling party leader Abdul Wajid and JD(S) party leader Netra Narayan were also present during the mayor's inspection of the lake.S Vishwanath from Biome Environmental Trust, who has worked extensively in rejuvenating the lake, said turtles were spotted in the lake a couple of months ago.""We've used different methods over the years to improve the quality of water in the lake,"" he said. ""This could be one of the reasons why we found the turtles. This was not there before."""	Jakkur Lake,BBMP,	 Feb 08 2019

Students design ‘portable and cheap’ Braille converter	A newly designed handheld Braille converter is making life easy for the blind.Now, the blind can walk into a library, pick up a book of their choice and allow the converter to transcribe it for them.The device, BBook, which converts text into Braille real-time, is the brainchild of two Computer Science Engineering students -- Rohit N and Ruchitha D J—belonging to Bengaluru’s MVJ College.Inventors of the device explained that the scarcity of Braille books –less than 1% of the printed books are transcribed into Braille- as the major reason behind designing the converter.Braille books are heavy and unwieldy, they point out. For instance, a 500-page Braille book weighs at least four kilos. Moreover, they cost ten times more than regular books.Hooked to the internet, the BBook can also download news articles and magazines and transcribe them for the user’s benefit.“Characters are picture-mapped and converted to Braille,” Rohit told DH, adding that the device allows the blind to access books that remained out of reach for them.Besides the hard copy, BBook can convert even digital materials. “These could either be in PDF or Word format,” Rohit said. “Digital books can be converted letter-by-letter.”The Braille converter was among several products on display at the Visweswaraya Industrial and Technological Museum on Saturday.“Initially, we weren’t sure if the product would make a difference. We visited Sri Rakum School for the Blind in Indiranagar and interacted with the teachers. With their encouragement, we took two months to work on the converter,” Rohit said.They tested the proto-type of the product with the blind students of Rakum School. “The students have suggested some minor changes and we’re working on it. Once the product is ready to be marketed, we expect its price to be below Rs 5,000,” Rohit said.	Braille,Bengaluru,	 Feb 06 2019
Volunteers paint street walls, transform cityscape	Every weekend over 20 volunteers including artists come together to transform the cityscape into vibrant spaces of colour and positivity.The group redecorates public walls, children’s homes, playgrounds, government schools and such, with meaningful doodles.As part of the ‘Paint For a Cause’ project, the volunteers have already painted over 20 street walls so far. To start with, the walls are cleaned up and whitewashed. Further on, they are painted upon with beautiful art, doodles and motifs, accompanied by inspiring messages. The area around the walls would otherwise be misused by the public, especially to urinate in the open and dump garbage. The ‘Paint for a Cause ‘ project is an initiative by Smileys India, a volunteer organisation that started functioning in 2015, with an aim to support NGOs and government structures through the medium of art. The volunteers are set to restore the Brahma Kumari Road in Koramangala - a stretch rundown with garbage dumped near the walls. The restoration effort, titled the Dyudle Art movement, is being organised in collaboration with the Dyu Art Cafe. The idea is to beautify the street walls of Koramangala in the coming weeks.“Now, people have stopped spitting and urinating. They are taking selfies instead, standing along the painted footpath and chatting. This is a welcome change and the very intent behind the whole project,” says Vidushi Jayaswal speaking about the success of the project.	Bengaluru,Paint For a Cause,	 Feb 06 2019

In conjunction with building a quantum computer, it is equally important to identify tasks where we can have a significant advantage over classical computing.”He added, “Applications of physics in neuroscience and probing novel aspects of psychophysics are also topics of considerable future importance.”Urbasi Sinha, convener, Celebrating Sir Anthony Leggett’s 80th Birth Anniversary said, “Anthony Leggett is one of the most celebrated physicists and deep thinkers of our time.”	Raman Research Institute,Anthony Leggett,Bengaluru,	 Feb 06 2019
Ornamental plants to add to Lalbagh's allure	New ornamental plants will add to the beauty and allure of Bengaluru's Lalbagh Botanical Garden in the coming days.The Baobab saplings that were planted two months ago near DHO Lawn are growing in height, providing an aesthetic appeal.“Around five saplings have been planted already. In the coming days, the trees are going to grab everyone’s attention, that’s how beautiful they are,” said N Jagadish, joint director (parks and plantations), Horticulture Department.Jagadish said the water holding capacity of the Baobab tree, which originated in African, is its most fascinating feature.“Baobab can hold around 15,000 to 20,000 litres of water in its roots and can live for more than 6000 years. We have chosen it because of all these aspects,” Jagadish said.Another tree named Beggar’s Bowl, which has been planted in the parking lot, yields ornamental fruits. “All the branches yield fruits in the shape of a bowl,” said Jagadish.Five saplings were planted recently along with the three existing ones. “These trees are easy to maintain. We have to occasionally water them for some months,” Jagadish added.Terminalia Mentali, a flower-bearing tree, will be another attraction in the parking lot. Also, a garden, called Sankan Garden, is being constructed close to the lake and is expected to bear plants from marshy areas and those that need more moisture to survive.

City hospitals observe World Cancer Day	City hospitals on Monday observed World Cancer Day creating awareness about the disease and early diagnosis and the treatment.Dr C Ramachandra, Director of the Kidwai Institute of Oncology, said a day-long programme was organised to educate how early diagnoses would make a difference in treating the disease.“Breast, cervical, and stomach cancers have increased in the past few years, and it is very alarming,” he added.The postal department released a postal cover to mark the occasion.Centre of ExcellenceManisha Koirala, Bollywood actress and cancer survivor, launched the Centre of Excellence for Immunotherapy, Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) and Pressurised Intraperitoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy (PIPAC) at Manipal Hospital.Dr H Sudarshan Ballal, Chairman of Manipal Hospitals, said: “The reason behind the alarming statistics of cancer is ignorance and denial of people, which often leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Nevertheless, the problem lies in the management of cancer and not the disease.”According to the National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR), around 2.25 million people are living with cancer in the country.Shortage of doctorsLack of specialist doctors seems to be affecting the non-communicable disease (NCD) programme initiated by the state government at various NCD clinics across the state.According to health department officials, there is a shortage of doctors, especially specialist, who could run the NCD centres. At the moment, there are at least 50% vacancies waiting to be filled.The NCD clinics were started to provide awareness about lifestyle diseases like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer. The health staff at the clinics screen patients for these diseases and refer them to larger health centres for further treatment.	World Cancer Day,Bengaluru,	 Feb 04 2019
Safety manual to help train cops	"A road safety manual, prepared by the transport department, was released on Monday to help train traffic police officers on some key measures needed to ensure the safety of road users.Home Minister M B Patil, who released the manual, called upon the public to cooperate with the police by being responsible. ""The police had identified 49 blackspots in the city and took several measures, which helped bring down the number of crime cases from 793 to about 600 over the past two years. However, the general public should do their part to become active players in upholding safety on the road,"" he said.Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Alok Kumar expressed concern over commuters bypassing traffic rules. ""The use of mobile phones while driving is banned. But people still use it via Bluetooth devices. Many try to get away by not wearing helmets and hardly anyone follows lane discipline,"" he said.The number of accidents in Bengaluru have come down from about 7,500 in 2016 to about 4,600 last year. The fatalities, which had reduced to 642 in 2017 from 793 in 2016, went up again last year to 684.The transport department also released a mini book on road safety for children, which contained illustrated examples of the dos and don'ts while using the roads.

Teens’ app to spot eye defect in kids	An app developed by two teenaged brothers to detect a defect in the eye has won the Grand Prize at the IRIS National Fair, India’s largest research-based science fair for students.Vrishab Krishna and Vishwesh Krishna, both students of National Public School, Indiranagar, will now represent India at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.Their app, Kanna, is a result of the brothers’ mission to ensure that a defect in children’s eyes does not go undetected. The teens claim to have come up with the solution after Vrishab had Amblyopia as a young boy.When Vrishab was four and his brother Vishwesh two years older set out to play, the elder sibling would catch a ball that was thrown at him with ease. However, Vrishab, unlike most children of his age, would be left perplexed. When children his age could just run down the stairs, Vrishab would watch every step and take longer.Multiple visits to ophthalmologists yielded no results. His mother Gayathri Krishna was told that he had long sight and that it would be fine as he grew older. She refused to buy the explanations of the doctors.“I noticed that in a few photographs, he was cross-eyed. When Vrishab was in second year Montessori, he was exceptionally nervous when he was asked to write,” she recalled.She took him to a Bengaluru-based paediatric ophthalmologist who diagnosed Vrishab with Amblyopia.This is a condition where one eye functions better than the other. In other terms, one of them is a lazy eye. “One optic nerve is dominant over the other. The brain takes one set of signals. Over time, the other tends to become blind,” she said.Simply applying a patch on the lazy eye and having the other eye to do the functioning is a solution. However, early detection is the key.Kanna, the app developed by the boys ensures early detection, claim the teenagers. Users can just upload a passport-size picture on the app, which will soon be available online. With image processing and machine learning techniques, the app can identify the potential risk factors and hence, possible cases with just a picture from the smartphone. The boys are running a validation with data from 600 cases from Shankara Eye Hospital.“We hope to take it to rural eye camps where we can identify other kids early. Children ought to be detected before the age of eight, failing which it could result in blindness. Conventional methods are time-consuming and we can pick those with risk factors better,” said Vrishabh.	Bengaluru,	 Feb 04 2019
A big thumbs down to tree-felling for steel flyover	Civil society on Sunday upped the ante against the marking of trees to be felled, to make way for the proposed steel flyover between Basaveshwara Circle and Mehkri Circle.Hundreds of members from various green outfits took to the streets in protest against the move to fell trees in the heart of Bengaluru. The not-for-profit, Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB) launched a campaign, #MaraHatyeTadeYojane, urging the government not to cut trees down for the project.“In solidarity with our beloved trees, we have gathered in peaceful protest. The government is keen to announce yojanes that will destroy the precious green cover. In response, we would like to commit ourselves to a #MaraHatyeThadeYojane,” said Srinivas Alavilli, co-founder of CfB.DH had reported the marking of 144 full-grown trees along the stretch. The sudden move had drawn stiff opposition from all quarters with conservationists and environmentalists raising their voice against the project.CfB has also launched a postcard campaign against the marking of trees. More than 5,000 postcards have been sent to the Chief Minister in this regard.“Last week, 144 trees have been marked for felling on the Ballari Road by KRDCL, according to media reports. Since the KRDCL is the nodal agency for implementing the proposed elevated corridor project, it appears that the agency is making preparations for cutting the trees down. However, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is not done and there is no environmental clearance for the project,” Alavilli of CfB added.“There is massive public opposition as well because alternatives that do not involve killing trees such as public transport are not being considered. The BBMP has not given any permission to cut these trees. The marking of these trees is seen as a disregard for the rule of law and to public sentiment,” said a CfB member.

Acceptance & positive mindset: Tips by cancer survivors	Getting treated at the Kidwai Hospital for leukaemia as a seven-year-old, Dr Aarthi decided that she would one day return as a doctor treating children with cancer.Dr Aarthi, now 23, is pursuing her post-graduation and is hoping to live her dream as a paediatric oncologist. “It (becoming a doctor) was decided when I underwent treatment at Kidwai. It was also my mother’s desire,” Aarthi says.More than the patient, it is the caregiver who suffers the most. In Aarthi’s case, it was her mother Prabha who soaked up the pressure and stood by her side. “First and foremost, you must accept that your loved one has cancer,” Prabha says.“Acceptance is the most difficult part. Once you accept it, half the battle is won. The rest is all about thinking positively and fighting the battle. Miracles do happen. Doctors said my daughter had just a few months to survive. She not only survived, but is working to be a cancer specialist, too,” she adds.A miracle P S Parameshwaran’s story of surviving cancer is nothing but a miracle. Such was his level of positive thinking that his blood group changed from B negative to B positive during the course of his treatment.Parameshwaran thanks his older brother for donating his bone marrow, which gave him a new lease of life.“Doctors couldn’t believe that my blood group had changed after the bone marrow transplant. My brother’s marrow suited me and helped me recover from the acute myeloid leukemia,” says the 50-year-old Parameshwaran.“Cancer is a mind game. We must approach it with positivity. The word ‘cancer’ begins with ‘can’ and ends with ‘ser’ to mean that we can survive,” he says.Often, the faith shown by the caregiver helps in the patient’s recovery. Ganapathi (75) has overcome cancer thanks to his wife Nalini’s positive thinking. “It’s not just a battle, but a war for me and my daughter,” says Nalini.“Doctors gave him just one month (to live). Even as he fought cancer, relatives began telling me that I should take his body (for the last rites) to his native. I had strong faith in Sai Baba. More than that, I had a positive feeling that my husband would fight and recover,” Nalini adds.Chemo 103 timesOnce given just 24 hours to live, kick-boxing champion Girish Gowda had received chemotherapy 103 times, while also winning the championship in the middle of his therapy. “I never smoked or drank.

Vogue clarifies on row, says students being misled	"The management of Vogue Institute of Fashion Technology, Bengaluru on Saturday clarified on the row, where few students have alleged the management misleading them during the admission. On Friday, 12 candidates, claiming to be the former students of Vogue Institute, who gave up the course for various reasons, alleged that the management was not returning their academic documents nor refunding the fees, and making them to run to pillar to post from past six months. They protested in front of the administrative office along with the support of Akhila Bharata Vidyarthi Parishat (ABVP) and took the assurance in written format from the management in the late night, after they called off the protest.Vogue Institute of Fashion Technology on further clarified on the allegations made by the students on approval of All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for the newly started courses. On Friday the members of Akhila Bharata Vidyarthi Parishat (ABVP) and students (claiming to be the former students of the institute) alleged that the college has not got valid approval from AICTE to start PGDM courses.Dr M M Kariappa, Founder and Chairman of Vogue Institute of Fashion Technology clarified that among 12 people who turned up, 11 of them are their students, who have attended the classes, practical examinations and internals held in December in their college. “There was one student who was also demanding to settle her dues. We remember returning her documents and refunding her fees long back. Rest of the students were very much part of our institution, and all of sudden on Friday they turned up protesting to return their documents. Even to return the document, there is a procedure to follow. How is it possible to return the documents and refund the fees in one day?,” asks Kariappa, by showing the valid proof of the affiliation for his institution from All India Council For Technical Education (AICTE).Cariappa surfaced the documents of getting approval from AICTE in April 2018. ""Ours is 23 year old institution, without valid approval its impossible to start any course. In April 2018, we got the approval for the PGDM course,"" Cariappa told DH, by surfacing the documents of getting approval from AICTE. He further added that these are all intended to tarnish the image of his institution. ""Students have been misguided by some people for their political and personal gains,"" he added. Asked him the reason behind the protest, Kariappa said, “I think these students have been misused by someone to their personal or political gains. I feel pity for them as they are spoiling their precious life. If at all they are demanding the settlement from past six months what is necessary for them to attend the class or take up the internals and practical examinations conducted by our college. So there is someone behind this, who is intended to tarnish the image of our institution and spoil students’ future.”The very first batch of the Vogue Institute’s PGDM program was commenced with 39 students. Since one person opted out after a week of the classes started, the strength was reduced to 38.A student, who is performing PGDM in Vogue also confirmed that those students were very much part of the class till Friday. “I don’t know what happened all of a sudden they were very much part of our classes. All of sudden we were shocked to see them protesting. What ever the allegations they are making are baseless. We have well qualified faculties and resource persons,” a student told DH."

Wood science institute ties up with schools	The Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST) has partnered with schools to tap people at the right age and sow the seeds of conservation.The IWST has tied up with Kendriya Vidyalaya (KV) and Navodaya Vidyalaya (NV) schools in Bengaluru to promote awareness about forests and environment.The MoU has been named ‘Prakriti’ and is the result of the partnership agreement inked between the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education in partnership with Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangha and Navodaya Vidyalaya Sangathan.Pankaj K Aggarwal, scientist, extension, IWST, told DH that for the first time an MoU has been signed with schools.The idea is to familiarise students about wood science, the museum, usage of wood and its importance. The aim is to also provide a platform for children to learn practical skills towards judicious use of wood.Inaugurated in 2012, the museum-cum-interpretation centre is one of its kind in Karnataka and receives around 2,500 people annually, mostly school and architecture students.At the museum, students can touch and feel the various types of woods, see the various colours, understand how to study the age of a tree and even know the tree’s history better. The museum also has a tree disc which traces the time since the British came to India until Independence.“Schools approach us individually to visit the museum when they get to know. But now we are tying up with them. In the first phase it is KV and NV. Gradually we will also tie up with private schools since educational tours are now a part of the curriculum,” he said.The IWST is also organising an awareness programme for children studying in classes VI-VIII in February.To reach out to the masses better, IWST has also decided to re-visit its two-year-old proposal of adding the museum to the city’s tourism map.N Mohan Karnat, director, IWST, said: “A proposal was made two years ago but it did not materialise. Now we are requesting the government and tourism department so that more visitors, especially students, can come. We are also working on adding more wood polymer made products in the museum to showcase innovations.”	Institute of Wood Science and Technology,	 Feb 01 2019

Freedom fighter, Gandhian among visitors to flower show	Many influential people joined the citizens to visit the 209th Lalbagh flower show on Sunday, the last day of the show.The show has been put together as part of the Republic Day celebrations in the city by the state Horticulture Department and the Mysuru Horticulture Society.Among the notable visitors were veteran freedom fighter H S Doreswamy and chairman of National Gandhi Memorial in Rajghat, Delhi, Annamalai who decided to visit the flower show after hearing about the replica of the Rajghat and the Sabarmati Ashram.The two were quite amused to see the floral displays inside the Glass House created to mark the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma. Several Gandhians, including those staying near the Wardha Ashram, visited Lalbagh on the last day of the flower show.But the Horticulture Department and the volunteers found it difficult to instil Gandhi’s message of cleanliness as visitors to the botanical garden littered the place with plastic bottles and carry bags. A mountain of plastic items was seen strewn around the place, despite a ban on their use.Lalbagh’s Deputy Director Chandrashekar M R said the department penalised 50 violators over the last 10 days and collected Rs 5,000 in fine. He insisted that the aim was to create awareness and not to punish people.The department had collected Rs 5,000 as deposit from the vendors who set up stalls at the flower show, which it would return if the area around the stalls is maintained well. But it would retain the deposit money and would levy further penalties if the stalls do not ensure the space is clean by January 28. Also, despite high security, the department was unable to keep away hawkers and illegal vendors who did brisk business at the garden.Official records reveal that the department collected Rs 29.22 lakh from 78,150 visitors on Sunday. Over the last 10 days, the department earned Rs 1,55,29,590 from the sale of tickets to 4,02,700 visitors.	Lalbagh Flower Show,Bengaluru,	 Jan 28 2019

Bosch's air quality study to help citizens 	German technology major Bosch is conducting a comprehensive study on air quality and local climate that would help governments and citizens plan daily activities like traffic management, commute and parking.A team from Bosch Mobility Solutions (BMS) has taken up a micro-climate monitoring system (Climo) study to assess the air quality in Electronics City and its surrounding areas on a pilot basis.They have installed an air quality measuring instrument to collect data on particulate matter (PM) 2.5, PM 10, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, Ozone, nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ranging temperature, noise pollution and humidity.Though the instrument was installed in September, the data collected so far will be analysed only in February, BMS’ head of city development Pawan Mulukutla told DH.Having installed 50 air quality measurement instruments in Pune with the municipal administration under the smart city programme, the seven-member BMS team has begun the pilot study in Bengaluru, though it has not partnered with the government here.However, the team has decided to share the data with the government to aid better planning. The BMS has partnered with the Electronics City for the project.Mulukutla said an average of the data collected is derived every 15 minutes and is used to understand seasonal, peak period and day variations.Unlike other studies, the BMS aims to overlay multiple factors on the data such as the traffic count, traffic management and health count and see if congestion in the city could be brought down. The BMS executive said the data will be gradually shared with the government, citizens and the companies to help decide such things as work timings, shifts, commute time, school timings, signal optimisation, parking management among other things.The team has set a one-year timeline to collect data, draw inferences and do the analysis.They say they are currently in the first stage. A similar Climo study has been taken up at Bosch campus in Koramangala and IISc campus.	Bosch,Bengaluru,	 Jan 26 2019

Techie shocked to find squatters in his home	A software engineer and the owner of a penthouse in HAL was in for a rude shock on his return from his native town of Mandya. Sravan Kumar was startled when he found squatters at his yet-to-be occupied southeast Bengaluru house.Recently, Kumar hired some men to renovate the house and had gone to his hometown.

Fertility clinic pays couple Rs 26 lakh	A consumer court has ordered a private hospital to pay Rs 26 lakh as compensation to a couple for medical negligence.The hospital was found guilty of negligence and deficient service while offering a specialised treatment to the pregnant woman who allegedly had a miscarriage as a result. Her husband made special efforts to learn the medical terminology to argue the case party-in-person at the consumer court.The couple, T H M Jagadeesha and his wife Sandhya reside in Kodichikkanahalli and work as software engineers in the city. Sandhya had two miscarriages since 2011, the first happening six weeks after conception and the second after 14 weeks.While looking for the specialised treatment to have a baby, Jagadeesha came across Cloudnine hospital on the internet. “The hospital claimed zero mortality and 99.72% survival rate of the babies. Its webpage also showed one Dr Leela Bhagavan as senior most consultant obstetrician and Gynecologist,” Jagadeesha said.The couple met Dr Leela Bhagavan and described the medical history. Sandhya was put on medication.In his complaint to the court, Jagadeesha said the doctor ignored watery discharge, lower backache, pulling sensation and bleeding, all within nine days of Sandhya’s conception. The complainant said the treatment lasted for 21 weeks and ended in miscarriage in June 2014. Right from the time she conceived, Sandhya has been visiting Dr Leela throughout the treatment period.In June 2014, Sandhya went to the hospital complaining discharge. The doctor ruled out infection and said it was due to poor hygiene. But when the condition did not improve eight days later, the doctor admitted there was infection and prescribed another medicine.On June 21, 2014, Sandhya was admitted to the hospital with severe backache and underwent a surgery.Jagadeesha said the doctor did not possess the requisite skills to deal with fertility and pregnancy issues. She promoted the medicines of a chain-linked company whose products are not approved by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. He also alleged that there was negligence on the part of the doctor and the hospital while examining the patient.The court held that the fact of the doctor’s qualification not being recognised by the MCI was evident when the hospital removed her qualification on its website after the issue came to light.“The doctor was aware of the fact that the patient had two abortions earlier and had a high risk,” the court noted.

DD against cash payment:HC notices to RBI, IBA and govt	The Karnataka High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and the state government over the inaction of the public sector banks in issuing demand drafts (DD) against cash payments unless the customers had bank accounts.The court was hearing a PIL challenging the same. A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy was hearing a petition filed by advocate Ramesh Naik.Naik moved court seeking directions to all the public sector and commercial banks to follow their own direction pertaining to the ‘issue and payment for demand drafts’, and not to create hardship for the customer by insisting him/her to have a mandatory bank account or demanding only cheques for issuing demand drafts up to any amount less than Rs 50,000.The petitioner contended that a large number of people are facing hardship when transacting at public sector banks in their effort to get DDs for even small amounts like Rs 100, 200, 500 or 1000.On December 24, 2018, the petitioner, in order to ascertain this, had tried to obtain a demand draft for a small amount of Rs 100 in favour of the ‘District Consumer Redressal Forum’ by visiting a few public sector banks. All of them refused to issue the DD stating cash payment cannot be accepted, and the amount should be paid by cheque or the customer should have an account.The petitioner further added that RBI ‘Master Direction - Know your Customer (KYC) Direction 2016’, provides for the acceptance of cash payments of any amount less than Rs 50,000 for issuing demand drafts.The petitioner also told the court that The State Bank of India agreed to issue a DD for the amount of Rs 100, after he complained in writing to the manager of the concerned bank.The DD was issued on submission of the petitioner’s Aadhar card, while refusing to accept any other identity proof.The petitioner, on December 26, 2018, submitted a representation via e-mail to the jurisdictional banking ombudsman designated for the purpose by the RBI, explaining the issue, and requesting to address the grievance faced by people in obtaining a DD. However no action was taken.Thereafter the petitioner submitted a representation via e-mail again to the Indian Banks’ Association which again resulted in no response, following which the petitioner approached the court. The court has adjourned the hearing.	Karnataka High Court,	 Jan 25 2019

We have issued notices to both parties, and the tenants of the building have been shifted,” Prakash, assistant executive engineer, BBMP told DH.“The owner is demolishing the tilted building at his own expense after the notice. There were no casualties,” he added.“Three families live here. As the building is old it is tilting so precariously. In the night the residents were alerted, and by morning all were shifted,” Sajid Pasha, a local resident said.	3-storey building,	 Jan 24 2019

Bangalore varsity in a fix over ‘recruitment backlog’	The Bangalore University (BU) administration is now in a fix after inviting applications to fill up ‘long vacant positions’.Opposing the move, BU officials and research scholars protested by thronging the vice chancellor’s (VC) chamber on Wednesday.“We welcome the move. But there are a lot of irregularities in the procedure. Though there are no vacancies, senior BU officials are showing filled up seats as vacant, and have invited applications for the positions,” the protesters alleged.According to the protesters, though the deputy chief minister, Dr G Parameshwara, had ordered the VC to conduct an inquiry and stop the recruitment, the BU has openly invited the applications.“As there were allegations on BU officials over giving wrong information to the social welfare department, the deputy chief minister had ordered to freeze the recruitment. This shows the stubborn attitude of the VC. Isn’t there any value to deputy chief minister’s order?”asked a research scholar.“The separate committee was formed to identify the requirements of the backlog positions. But till date there is not even a single meeting chaired. If these people give positions to their candidates why would we need a committee. Government should conduct a proper inquiry into the matter,” said Mylarappa, director in-charge, BU distance education.Commenting on the development, BU VC Venugopal KR said, “I will be writing to the government. For now, I have written to the various departments asking for information on the backlog. After getting the information from the departments we will publish this on the website. Later, if there are any objections we will submit that to government. Thereafter, we will follow the government orders.”BU engineer suspendedMeanwhile, the higher education principal secretary has ordered the suspension of BU Engineer Puttaswamy, after an allegation that he misappropriated Rs 1.50 crore.“This will be discussed in the syndicate meeting scheduled on Thursday.

Child lock disabled in 42,000 cabs: Govt to HC	The child lock feature has been disengaged in 42,000 out of 2.5 lakh cabs in the state, the government submitted to the high court on Wednesday.In the next three months, the feature would be removed from the remaining cabs, it added.A division bench headed by Acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy was hearing the public interest litigation filed by Bangalore Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology seeking directions to the authorities concerned to disable the system in cabs in the wake of crimes being committed against women travelling in cabs.In the last hearing, the government had told the court that it had issued notices to the cab aggregators to deactivate the feature in taxis.The petitioner had filed the petition after being aggrieved by the inaction of the authorities in ensuring the safety of women travelling in cabs in Bengaluru and other parts of the state.The petitioner had contended that the child safety locks are built into the rear doors of most cars to prevent the rear seat passengers from opening the door while in motion, and this feature has been in existence since the 1980s in most cars. The intent was to provide the driver with a safe method to prevent children from opening the door, the petitioner said.The feature gets activated when one gets into the car. Once in the car, it is impossible for the passenger to open the door and run out in case of an emergency. The passenger is trapped inside and is at the mercy of the driver.The petitioner had further contended that despite increasing crimes against women in the city, the government and the authorities concerned have failed to take any action.Following the submission of the state to disengage the lock from the remaining cabs, the court disposed of the petition.	child lock system,Karnataka High Court,	 Jan 23 2019

Fire on BU campus, 4th incident this month	With winter yet to retreat and summer weeks away, the sprawling campus of the Bangalore University (BU) is already vulnerable to fire. In January alone four incidents were reported.The latest mishap occurred on Tuesday afternoon. At 1 pm, a fire was spotted opposite to the Pariksha Bhavan (examination block), which gutted at least 10 acres of land in the campus. Though the fire brigade was immediately rushed to the spot, they struggled to put the fire out until late evening.“This is not a wildfire. As there are a lot of dry leaves and grasses around the campus, some might have thrown a lit cigarette or lighted match stick. This would have set ablaze the dry leaves, only to be fanned by the hot sun and the afternoon wind. This is the fourth such incident this month,” a senior fire official told DH.As Tuesday was declared a government holiday, the regular traffic inside the campus was missing. Student and faculty were not present in the campus, which helped avoid a major mishap.As a precautionary measure, BU is housing a fire brigade to cater to the surrounding areas in the huge campus in order to avoid further fire accidents.“This is common this season. During the summer, our campus is more prone to such incidents. So, we have a fire brigade in place. Just like the wildfire is natural, some incidents are man-made,” a senior BU official told DH.

Petition in HC vs apartment complex coming up on ‘road’	"The High Court of Karnataka has issued a notice to the BBMP commissioner on a PIL petition against the development of a piece of land said to belong to the civic body. A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy on Monday heard a petition filed by advocate N P Amrutesh for preventing the development of the 2,544-square foot plot which he claims is a ""road"". The property is located along KR Road. The court also ordered notices to the chief engineer and the joint director of the town and country planning department and local BBMP officials.

A vegan lunch to raise funds for barnyard animals	A vegan lunch organised on Sunday to raise funds for barnyard animals drew about 130 people. Organised by CARE (Charlies Animal Rescue Centre), the fundraiser aimed to raise awareness about the health aspects of vegan food and about barnyard animals. Sudha Narayanan, trustee, CARE, said many people had little knowledge about pigs, guinea pigs, roosters, hens and many other barnyard animals. Another aim of the fundraiser lunch was to provide quality food and medical care to these animals, she added. While many animals in poor health have been rescued from across the city, many others are lying unattended because people do not know whom to contact for their care, Sudha said. The idea of such a fundraiser is to make people aware of the shelters where these animals can be housed. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has been working only on the rescue of street animals, she added. CARE houses 260 animals, of which 50 are barnyard animals.	CUPA,	 Jan 21 2019

A digital study room for PU students	"Students who are preparing for the upcoming PU board examinations can now turn to QBER - a digital study room. The digital interactive platform can be accessed through smartphones. Here, the students will collaborate, co-create, compete and help each other to answer questions put forth by experts.QBER, developed by IPOMO, trains students in a unique and innovative way somewhat similar to cricket coaching. QBER is often referred to as the 'question bowling machine'.Students just have to download the app, which then would deliver five most probable questions with a schema in all the subjects including science, commerce and arts. How it can be accessed The digital study room can be accessed on IPOMO's OnBimba app, or at https://onbimba.com/qber“The student can write the answers on a sheet of paper, click a photograph and post it on the platform. This will be reviewed by the experts in the respective subjects. Students from rural and urban areas will be a part of this community, free of cost.""A smartphone has become a part and parcel for students; we are making learning more interesting and innovative digitally. Keeping the writing part in mind, we have retained the pen and paper system,” Hariprakash Shanbag, MD, IPOMO, told DH.In 2018, as a pilot, QBER was launched in Seshadripuram College. After seeing a good response, the designers have opened the platform for everyone.Dr Wooday P Krishna, secretary, Seshadripuram Institute, said, ""QBER is a platform for the rural students, too, and can be termed as the digitisation of the good old 'combine study'. With QBER, students will also be able to develop their communication skills as well.”"	pre-university,Digital Study Room,	 Jan 19 2019
IISc research scholars protest Delhi police action	Nearly 300 research scholars sat on a 12-hour-long hunger strike at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) on Friday in protest against the detention of their peers in New Delhi. Calling the detentions “unconstitutional”, the scholars demanded a hike in the stipend and raised slogans against the authorities. “Our fellow research scholars were not causing any ruckus. It was just a silent protest march but police treated them as criminals. When thousands of miscreants are spared, why treat us so badly? Don’t we have the right to put forth our demands peacefully,” a protester asked. Presently, junior research scholars are paid a stipend of Rs 25,000 while seniors get Rs 28,000. “How can we make ends meet with this money? We run out of money towards the end of each month,” a senior research scholar said. Gaurav Solra, general secretary, students council, IISc, chipped in: “When peace was not disturbed, was it necessary for the authorities to act like that?”	Indian Institute of Science,research scholars,	 Jan 19 2019
App to identify homeless people	The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is developing an application to store facial recognition and other data of homeless people while conducting a homeless survey in all the 198 wards.The BBMP Information Technology (IT) department is developing the app and the civic body's welfare department officials will use this to store the data of homeless people and identify them.Speaking to DH, BBMP Special Commissioner, Randeep D said: “In all, officials at the 198 wards of the BBMP will conduct the survey of homeless people. We will collect data along with the facial recognition of the homeless people in an app which will be developed soon.”“Since the homeless people are often wanderers, we have to track them to take care of them in the urban centres. The app will store their photos, name and the centre or place where they have to stay,” he added.The Supreme Court in 2010 directed all the state governments to set up shelters for the homeless, especially in towns with a population of 1 lakh and more.The urban homeless survey by the BBMP along with Dream India Network and Impact India Consortium was completed in three major zones of the city in December 2018. Officials identified close to 1,200 urban homeless in the East zone itself. South and West are the other two zones where the survey was completed.The civic body has also identified 1,526 homeless people in the West zone and at least 2,200 in the South. The BBMP is planning to set up around 40 permanent shelters across the city for the homeless people by next winter. This would come as a huge relief for the thousands sleeping out in the open on the streets and pavements of Bengaluru.“We have completed the survey in East, West, and South zones, we will start the survey in other five zones soon,” Randeep explained.DH News Service	Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,homeless,	 Jan 18 2019

Penniless in Paris to shaking up art scene	Growing up in abject poverty in a Kolkata refugee camp, Shombit Sengupta landed in Paris with $8 in his pocket and even swept the floors for a living.Years later, this Indo-French artist would shake up the art world, pioneering a brand new movement called ‘Gesturism’, now all set for a Bengaluru showcase.In Sengupta’s own words, Gesturism is about art celebrating the limitless gestures of all living beings, of the movements of life itself. It was in 1994, a full 23 years after his daring foray into France, that Sengupta coined that word, one that would define how he captured impromptu, vibrant movements in his arresting paintings.On January 16, Sengupta’s Gesturism artworks themed ‘Hidden Figuratives’ will come alive at the city’s Gallery Time & Space. Vividly colourful, the paintings are dense with multiple layers of strokes. At first glance, the subjects are not well defined. But look deeper, and the figures would appear to move around on the canvas.But decades before his works inspired artists across the world, Sengupta had to endure extreme hardships in the slum-like refugee camp in Shohidnagar, about 50 km from Kolkata. The place had no electricity, sanitation or potable water.To escape this miserable state, “As a child, I would cross the Ganga into the erstwhile French Colony in Chandan Nagar. It was a different world, with Western architecture and promenades. The paintings of renowned European painters in the French museum library there inspired me,” Sengupta recalled.That sealed his determination to carve a niche for himself in European art. At the age of 19, he dared to be different, arriving virtually penniless in Paris. The culture shock hit him, yet he hung on. But his decision to stay put in the heart of Paris against all odds would change his destiny, forever.Sengupta wanted to be in the heart of French society. “I chose to work as a sweeper in a lithographic print shop near Paris. Many famous painters of the time would come there to get their lithographs made.

Biodiversity parks in BU soon: VC	To increase biodiversity in the city, especially Bangalore University, the varsity syndicate has directed each department to create a bio-diversity park.Vice-Chancellor of Bangalore University K R Venugopal on Thursday said the syndicate has earmarked 50 acres to Botany department and 10 acres to each department to create bio-diversity parks.From 1974, when 1,111 acres were allocated to the University, only 500 acres now remain with it. So every department will have to take the responsibility to create the park and protect it, Venugopal said while speaking at the inauguration of a day-long workshop on “Traditional Knowledge as Intellectual Property Right- Documentation and Scope for Patent Protection,” organised by Karnataka Biodiversity Board (KBB) and Botany Department.The aim of the workshop was to interact with researchers, lecturers and students on the importance of biodiversity, research and patents.Faced with a shortage of trained lecturers and researchers, Venugopal said the pressure is now on students to work individually. He said the matter will be discussed with the education minister after the Belagavi Session ends.Chairman of the Department of Environmental Sciences R K Somashekar used the platform to call government organisations, including KBB, to help create and protect bio-diversity parks. He requested KBB to look at universities and researchers for work, instead of agencies, for their projects.Somashekar pointed that the problem with patenting traditional knowledge is that Indians are very slow when compared to other countries, like increase of turmeric and Basmati rice. This is despite the fact that 80% of medicines researched and sold are brain-child of Indian pharmaceutical companies and farmers.KBB member secretary Virender Singh said traditional knowledge is available since long but is highly misused. The Board is now interacting with communities to accumulate data and patent it.	Bangalore University,	 Dec 14 2018

Its vision was clear: to use the power of applied improvisational theatre for change and explore theatre that is spontaneous, intuitive and beyond the script.Till date, Yours Truly Theatre has to its credit over 500 interactive theatre performances and trained over 2,500 newbies in basic theatre, says the group’s co-founder and artistic director, Nandini Rao. Currently, the team is about 100 strong with a full-fledged advisory board and seven international mentors.The three tracks This Sunday, TRULY 15 will unfurl itself in three tracks. The morning first track will be about ‘Theatre applied in social change’ with its focus on the education sector and therapy for children and parents.The second track in the afternoon will see panel discussions and case study presentations by corporates. The day will culminate with the final track, packed with theatrical presentations.The performances will give a glimpse of what Yours Truly Theatre has been doing all these years: from playback theatre to shadow theatre, perspective dramas to image theatre, theatre for couples to black rainbow. This open event will kick off at 6.30 pm on December 16.	Bengaluru,Yours Truly Theatre,	 Dec 13 2018
Research scholars demand 80% increase in fellowship	The research scholars of the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, who are protesting against the discrimination in the allocation of funds for PhD and postdoctoral scholars, have demanded an 80% hike on the current fellowship.The students who are protesting have appealed to the Department of Atomic Energy, HRD ministry, principal scientific advisors for initiation, increment and regularisation of fellowship for all research scholars.“During the last few years, public spending in higher education and in particular research in basic sciences and humanities have gradually declined, which is adversely resulting in high drop-out rates and increasing brain drain. This also affects India’s research ecosystem as well as scientific technologies,” students expressed their concerns by adding that 70% of the scholars in the country are severely discriminated, and the majority of them are not having a fellowship at all.In the letter, the research scholars have also explained the current pay scales at different government institutes and R&Ds. “The existing fellowships were last revised in October 2014 on a promise of periodic revisions every three to four years. As of date, neither the fellowship have been revised nor has been any such announcements made,” the letter added.By highlighting the loopholes, the research scholars have raised few demands, which mainly urges to fix the various problems arising while awarding the fellowship.All scholars must be entitled to dignified fellowship without any discrimination, which will be disbursed on a regular monthly basis, and to be revised on a yearly basis.The disparity of postdoctoral fellowship across institution must be eliminated and 80% increase in the amount, which is been currently awarded, fee reduction in different research institutes and universities, and provide adequate infrastructure and funding for research in humanities and basic science.

Sankey Tank track to be reinforced	At a time when most lakes in the city are in need of immediate attention, Sankey Tank, one of the very few well kept urban commons in the city, is all set to get a face-lift at a cost of Rs 4.5 crore.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is planning to introduce dedicated tracks for joggers and walkers on the three sides of the water-body. In the past few years, cracks have appeared on the existing track, and in some areas the track is sliding away, causing difficulty for the regulars.To arrest the sliding of the track, the civic body has planned to strengthen the tank bund by incorporating gabion boxes. The gabion box technology is used to strengthen bunds, and shores up well against erosion.“Three sides of the lake are used by walkers and joggers every day. In few areas, there are slides, which have damaged the walker’s track. Hence we have planned to repair,” Jagannath Rao, BBMP’s deputy conservator of forests told DH.“We will first place gabion boxes, upon which we will construct the walker’s path. The gabion boxes will avoid slides and erosion. We have taken up the work in the west bank of the lake already, and the work will start soon in the eastern and southern banks,” he added.Once the modern walker’s track is completed, a bridge connecting the east and west bank will be constructed. Sankey Tank was built in 1882 by the British officer Richard Sankey, to meet the water supply demands of the city. On an average, Sankey Tank attracts around 2,000 fitness enthusiasts daily.“The main reason for the damage on the pathway is constant water current and erosion over a period of time, which led to the weakening of the wall,” explained Jagannath Rao.

LGBTQ community continues to face discrimination	The Supreme Court may have repealed Section 377 and the state government may have introduced a transgender policy, but life for the LGBT community has not changed.Participants at Sunday’s Namma Pride march said they are rejected by citizens, and corporate and government officials.Over 3,000 people marched at the 11th edition of Namma Pride and Karnataka Queer Habba, organised by CSMR (Coalition for Sex Workers, Sexual & Sexuality Minorities’ Rights), Karnataka. “We go through a lot of harassment, the biggest of them is getting a gender certificate,” said Kumar, a member of Samara Society. “We have to undergo a series of tests at recognised government hospitals to get gender certificates. It’s very shameful. Many refuse to obtain a gender certificate because of the embarrassment, though it helps us get recognition.” An in-house census says of the 7,000 LGBTQs in the city, a meagre 250 have obtained gender certificates. Many working at government and private sectors refuse to come out due to social stigma, said Julian, a participant.“We are unable to get government jobs, rental accommodation or bank loans. After the court order, many private organisations have sacked their employees on learning about their identities,” Kumar added.‘I have no friends’Cosmetology student Riyana said people distance themselves once they come to know her real identity. “I have no friends in college,” she said. “It’s very difficult to continue my part-time job on many days. Even the police ill-treat us. The promise of awareness programmes to sensitise people hasn’t happened,” Riyana said.While the state conducts training programmes like tailoring and beautician courses through its departments, getting jobs or financial aid even from the government is impossible.The government has not yet called the association members to understand their demands and issues, said Yash, an organiser and participant.Their demands include full implementation of the SC verdict, sensitising the LGBTQIA community and the private sector, implementation of the Karnataka transgender policy, 2017 and review of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016.

March organized in support of evicted migrant workers	Hundreds of Bengalureans from Mahadevapura marched in solidarity on Sunday, in support of the migrant workers who were evicted from slums in the area.Last week, the slum dwellers in Thubarahalli and Kundalahalli near Bellandur were forcefully evicted from their sheds at the behest of the local MLA, Arvind Limbavali. As the police stood guard, a small portion of the labour sheds at Munnekolala labour camp were razed. Thereafter, the homeless had to seek refuge in the neighbouring sheds, under the trees and out in the open.Most of the migrant workers are from different parts of Karnataka, including Hassan, Bidar and parts of north Karnataka. Some are from Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Citizens under the banner ‘Bengaluru for Thubarahalli and Kundalahalli’, took out the solidarity march.“The slum dwellers are the people that build our apartments, metros, roads; they have in fact built Bengaluru. They are the underprivileged who have left their villages and come here to earn a living. There are plenty of corporate staff in Bengaluru, why are we not kicking them out?” asked Vijayakumar Seethappa, a member of the Karnataka Janaarogya Chaluvali. “We are supporting the poor with humanity. We do not want to witness sectarian violence, and the city being divided,” Seethappa said. According to Seethappa, those who claim that illegal migrants live in our city’s slums have ‘vested interests’.“We had challenged the BBMP’s demolitions, and recently the stay order was given to restore the houses. We will stand by them and support them,” said Umesh, another supporter.	migrant workers,Bengaluru,	 Dec 10 2018
City docs reconstruct Yemeni war victim’s lower jaw	Seventeen-year-old Hussain, a war victim from Yemen had lost his lower jaw (mandible) in a bomb blast in his country. However, with the help of doctors from the city, his lower jaw was naturally reconstructed harvesting his bone and stem cells.Hussain could not close his mouth and had difficulty in swallowing due to lack of skeletal support. Despite undergoing multiple reconstructive surgeries and visiting various countries for the same, he finally found some relief at the Manipal Hospital in Malleswaram.Nisha Shetty, consultant Facio Maxillary surgeon at the hospital who treated Hussain said,” Hussain’s previous surgeries left very little opportunity for us. He had undergone grafting, both fibulaes (lower limbs) were used and multiple soft tissue grafts were harvested to perform surgeries; it was difficult to reconstruct his jaw again,” she added.After thorough planning, the doctors from Manipal Hospital used 3D scanning and printing to reconstruct the mandible. With the help of Hussain’s stem cells, hip bone (illium) and bone graft impregnated into a 3D printed model, a customised prefabricated mandible was fixed to his residual bone.Hussain was 17 when he lost his jawbone in a blast, and had undergone 9 surgeries across the globe. After 3 years, he visited Manipal hospital where his mandible was naturally reconstructed using his stem cells. Hussain had to wait for three months for his mandible to grow.

Now, go boating on Yediyur Lake	City residents and tourists alike can now enjoy the breathtaking vista around the 1,400-year-old Yediyur Lake in South Bengaluru, as the BBMP launches boating services on the famous waterbody.Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun on Saturday inaugurated the eco-friendly boat rides on the historic lake, which attracts several migratory birds during the winter. Yediyur becomes the second lake in the city after Madiwala to have boating services.For Rs 50, visitors will get half-an-hour of boating on the lake’s clear waters. To avoid noise that could disturb the winged visitors, the BBMP has banned motorised boats.“The noise of the motorboats can unsettle the migratory birds and the diesel spill could pollute the lake. So, we are only using the pedal boats,” said N R Ramesh, husband of corporator Poornima Ramesh.The corporator said a youth organisation — Kuvempu Yuvakara Sangha — bought the boats for Rs 12 lakh and is paying Rs 60,000 annual rent to the BBMP to operate the boats on the lake.Given the lake’s strong Hoysala connections, it is named after the famous queen of that dynasty Shantala Devi, who, as claimed by an inscription, bathed in its waters. All the eight boats in the lake have also been named after various Hoysala kings.Children below 15 are not allowed without adult supervision, while the use of plastic, smoking and consumption of alcohol are also banned near the waterbody.

Schools warn parents against PUBG online game	Schools in Bengaluru have begun to warn parents against children excessively playing the online game Player Unknown’s Battle Grounds (PUBG) after cases of addiction came to light.Shocked by the number of cases that are being referred to the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, several schools have asked parents to keep a tab on the number of hours their child spends playing the game.The Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Private Schools Karnataka (KAMS) will also issue advisory to parents asking them to restrict the number of hours students spend on the game.“We will ask our member schools to write to parents about this. We have, in the past, had discussions with the education department on imposing restricts on the number of hours a child spends playing such games. We want the police to also play an active role and take precautions to ensure measures are put in place to ensure children do not play such games,” KAMS stated.The game involves players fighting each other with weapons and the one who survives at the end is the winner. What begins as a game lasting about 30 minutes, keeps a player hooked on for several hours, leading to addiction, experts warn.Dr Manoj Kumar Sharma from the SHUT Clinic, Nimhans, said that five out of eight cases that are referred to them is related to PUBG addiction.“They are between the 16 to 20 age group. When we speak to them they explain that better graphics and interface is a reason they chose this game over the others,” Dr Sharma said.These students said that they have been playing the game for 10-12 hours. “This leads to disturbance in the morning schedule, has an impact on food habits, academic life is affected and withdrawal leads to aggression,” Dr Sharma said, while adding that whether PUBG as a game was leading to aggression is yet to be ascertained.“Schools should issue advisory to students about positive lifestyle. They must be cautioned against excessive gaming. Parents should check if kids are using it for too long,” Dr Sharma added.Meanwhile, Dr Bhujang Shetty, chairman, Narayana Nethralaya, said, “Staring into any electronic gadget for too long leaves children with a high risk of myopia.It could also cause stress to the eye. Hence there is a need to curb it,” Dr Shetty warned.	PUBG,Gaming addiction,	 Dec 06 2018
 Foreign language mandatory for BU management students	Management students at Bangalore University (BU) will have to study a foreign language from the upcoming academic year. Lack of basic foreign language skills has become the main concern during campus placements. The university’s board of studies, management courses, has decided to make at least one foreign language compulsory at the postgraduate level. “Many international recruiters have been demanding this skill of our students. As they are very particular about their native languages, English is the least preferred. So, in the career perspective of our students, it will be very helpful,” K Janardhanam, head, Canara Bank School of Management (CBSM), told DH. The university is yet to decide on the foreign languages, which will be mainly based on demand. To introduce one foreign language, they will need at least 10 management students. From the 2019-20 academic year, there will be a compulsory paper on Employability and Language Learning for first- and third-semester students studying PG management in BU. Janardhanam said: “Students will get four credits, which include assignments and 60-hour classes. The Centre for Global Languages on the Bangalore Central University (BCU) campus has sufficient staff, who will be roped into the programme. If not, we are planning on guest faculty. Students are free to select the foreign language of their choice, but it will be introduced only if 10 students enrol.” A senior official in BU said: “There is a demand for French, German, Spanish and Russian in general. The demand for the same in management course might vary. We are yet to design the course plan. We will consider all the stakeholders and design it. This will be surely implemented in the next academic year.”	Bangalore University,	 Dec 04 2018
Cancer surviour undergoes leadless pacemaker implant	"A 74-year-old woman, who is a cancer surviour, underwent the first leadless pacemaker implant in a city hospital recently. Unlike the traditional pacemaker, the leadless pacemaker was directly placed inside the patient's heart without surgery through the femoral vein. The woman, who also suffers from morbid obesity, had transient loss of consciousness (syncope) due to intermittent high grade electrical heart block.Explaining the procedure, Dr Shashidhar, Consultant Interventional Cardiologist and Electrophysiologist at Fortis Hospitals said that a traditional pacemaker could not be used as it was difficult in this case. ""The veins of upper arms where the traditional pacemakers are generally implanted were blocked due to the chemotherapy cycles, which the patient received for her breast cancer treatment in the past. Therefore, we used the leadless pacemaker for this patient,"" he said.“Compared to the traditional pacemaker which costs around Rs 1.5 lakh, the leadless pacemaker costs close to Rs 10 lakh. Moreover, this technology was introduced just 2 years ago. The patient withstood the procedure well and did not experience any unconsciousness post implant. In comparison to a conventional pacemaker, the new-age leadless pacemaker eliminates the need for a surgical pocket, there is no visible pacemaker device under a patient's chest skin, no incision scar on the chest, no connector wires or lead, and no restrictions on any daily activities.“ added Dr Shashidhar.Conventional pacemakers are surgically placed under the skin of the patient with the help of wires stretching from veins on the arms to the heart, which can further cause complications. Whereas in the leadless pacemaker, the patient does not experience any discomfort, infections, device complications or dysfunction. The conventional pacemakers weighs about 30 to 40 gm whereas the leadless pacemaker weighs only 2 gm with 0.8 cc volume. The battery life of the pacemaker is same as that of a conventional pacemaker which is around 7 to 8 years."	Cancer Patient,Pacemaker,	 Dec 04 2018
Biffes from Feb 7-14	The Bengaluru International Film Festival (Biffes) will be held from February 7 to 14, 2019, and the Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy has requested the government to frame rules to ensure the festival is held on the same dates every year. Academy chairman and filmmaker Nagathihalli Chandrashekhar confirmed the dates on the Biffes website. He said fixing a calendar will bring international accreditation to the festival and insulate it from political developments.“This is the 11th edition of the festival and it’s time it gets recognition among the global film fraternity. The accreditation will increase the variety of cinema and broaden the festival’s scope in the years to come. We have requested the government to pass an order in this regard,” he told DH but refused to reveal more details stating that it will be announced by the chief minister.Sources said about 250 movies may be screened during the festival and popular films may get as much time and space as the serious ones. Asked about the prominence of popular movies, Chandrashekhar said the festival will be balanced in its approach.“Both art cinema and popular movies will go hand in hand considering that the film industry supports these events. However, the emphasis is on aesthetics and there is no compromise. We have looked at the format of film festivals across the world. Besides the popular ones, there will be several movies in regional, national, Asian and international categories,” he said.No fest in MysuruChandrashekhar said the film festival will not be extended to Mysuru. “Many organisations from different towns have come, seeking to hold a film festival in their places as well. While I believe in taking movies to villages, Biffes is not the right event for that. Instead, we are trying to make the whole process as democratic as possible by involving all organisations and associations in Sandalwood,” he said.Asked about the budget of the festival, he said the chief minister’s office had told them not to waste money on grandeur. “There are several pressing issues like floods in Kodagu, drought in other parts of the state and farmers’ distress. We will make every effort to keep the budget at the lowest,” he said.	Bengaluru International Film Festival,	 Dec 04 2018
Wait a year to microchip and protect sandalwood trees	Save your sandalwood trees for another year. Perhaps, then you can purchase a microchip from the Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST), link it to your smart phone, and save your tree from any where in the world.After two years of research and development on inserting microchips on sandalwood trees, IWST and Hitachi India Private Limited are now correcting the anomalies before making the service available to public.Karnataka government had taken the lead in inserting microchips on sandalwood trees. The move was to protect the Sandalwood -- the state tree of Karnataka -- from illegal loggers. The microchips would also help maintain a sandalwood tree count. In October 2016, IWST and Hitachi had launched an e-Protection System for High Value Trees, along with an App. Though the list included sandalwood, red sander and rose wood trees, the focus was on sandalwood. A microchip is inserted in the tree bark which detects threats if any, and sends an alert to the owner’s mobile phone.As a sample, IWST and Hitachi installed microchips on 100 sandalwood trees of which 50 are in a private land in Nelamanagala, and the remaining in the IWST campus in Bengaluru.“After we installed the chips, we got to know the technical issues. They are now being corrected, and then the chip will be available for people to purchase and install,” IWST Director Surendra Kumar told DH.Initially, the hiccups were many. At times, the battery size was bigger than the tree-trunk. Also, the battery-life was just about 7 to 8 months and replacing it was a problem. The biggest hurdle was the sensitivity of the chip to natural wear and tear.	Sandalwood Trees,microchips,	 Dec 04 2018
Kadlekai Parishe begins, draws thousands	Roasted, dry, raw or boiled - it was groundnuts all the way in southern Bengaluru’s Basavanagudi on Monday. The first day of Kadlekai Parishe, the annual groundnut fair, drew thousands to the famous Bull Temple Road. Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun, along with Basavanagudi MLA Ravi Subramanya, corporator B S Sathyanarayana, JD(S) MLC T A Sharavana and Chickpet MLA Uday Garudachar, inaugurated the fair on Monday morning. They also carried out Tulabhara of the Nandi idol (an ancient practice in which a person or idol is weighed against a commodity). An equivalent weight of groundnuts was then distributed to the public. The Kadalekai Parishe is observed on the last Monday of Kartika Masa every year. Though the fair officially began on Monday and will go on until Wednesday, locals have been celebrating it for the past three days. But the fair isn’t just about groundnuts. There are hundreds of trinket shops selling everything from fashion accessories to toys. There are also eateries. As for Kadlekai, roasted groundnuts sold like hotcakes as they can be readily eaten. The opening-day crowd consisted mostly of college students. Plastic ban hits businessThe ban on the use of plastic led to a dip in sales compared with previous years, many vendors complained. Cheluvi, a vendor from Tamil Nadu, said she hiked the prices to Rs 35-40 per kilo as against the last year’s Rs 25-30 to give paper bags to customers. “Not everyone brings paper or cloth bags. So, we have to shell out on paper bags,” said Cheluvi, who has been setting up a stall at the fair for the past three years. Many vendors are from Dharmapuri, Tamil Nadu, where groundnut is grown on a large scale.

Traumatised cabbie prepares to leave city	"An Ola cab driver who was abducted, assaulted and robbed by four unidentified miscreants — who also forced his wife to strip on video call — is so traumatised by the incident that he has decided to return to his native in Andhra Pradesh.Shivakumar (name changed), 37, hails from Kadiri in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. He had come to the city 15 years ago and worked as a driver at call centres before moving to the cab aggregator five years ago.Speaking to DH, Shivakumar said it was the second time that he was assaulted on duty. Previously, he was beaten up by a passenger during night shift.Shivakumar lives with his wife and two children at a rented house in Doddathogur.Friday nightmareShivakumar was abducted from Adugodi on Friday night by a gang that had hailed his cab.He initially thought he would be released unharmed after he gave in to their demands of withdrawing money from ATMs. But, even after giving them Rs 30,000, the assailants asked him to make a video-call to his wife, who was then forced to strip. The gang took screenshots of the act.Later, Shivakumar was taken to a lodge in Channapatna. When the robbers realised that he didn’t have any money left, they threatened to upload his wife’s screenshots on social media. He was forced to call his brother-in-law who, in turn, transferred him money online.In the lodge, Shivakumar said he overheard the assailants plotting to kill him on way to Madikeri. He, however, escaped through the window of the washroom.‘Run to station’After he escaped around 7.05 am on Saturday, Shivakumar came across a police constable attached to Channapatna station near the lodge and informed him about the incident. But the policeman asked him to “run” to the station and inform them. After spending nearly 30 minutes at the police station, two constables came to the lodge with him on two bikes, by which time the assailants had fled.Shivakumar said the assailants were looking for ganja and liquor on Friday night, but in vain. “They told me that I was alive because there was no ganja or liquor. They would have killed me in an inebriated state. They also said they are not afraid of police complaints,” he said.All the four assailants were aged between 22 and 30, well-built and spoke in Kannada and English.There has been no arrest in the case yet. The Adugodi police have formed a team to nab the culprits.Ola yet to reach out to victimShivakumar said that it has been three days since the assault and two days since he filed a police complaint but Ola, the company which facilitated the assailants to book the cab, had not contacted him. He said that like thousands of drivers, he worked day and night for the company but none from the Ola team contacted him to extend any support.To a query, an Ola spokesperson insisted that the company was ""on top of the case""."

Authorities moot lake cess again	The Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority (KTCDA) and the Minor Irrigation Department (MID) are again pressing for the collection of lake cess from residential and commercial complexes around lakes.According to them, the idea is not new. The officials assert that districts and cities have already implemented the idea, and the same should be done in Bengaluru also.The Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority (KLCDA) first came up with the proposal a year ago. However, the government and the cabinet did not accept it then.Manjunath, KTCDA Commissioner, said the lake cess was collected in other places and Bengaluru should also adopt this. Collecting the lake cess is essential as it would help the departments in their functioning, and would also bring a sense of responsibility among people.Both the departments are now examining the plan in detail and are working to pressing it before the government once again.They hope the proposal to be accepted as the government has shown a lot of trust in both the departments.Quoting the example of Bellandur and Varthur lakes, where locals point fingers at government officials for not doing anything and also give suggestions, the officials say that the citizens should also help the government in improving the lakes.V Govindaraj, Deputy Secretary, Water Resources, MID said: when KLCDA was repelled, the government order clearly stated that all works and proposals undertaken by the KLCDA would continue. The MID, the monitoring agency and the custodians of the lakes, should take onus and work towards it.The authority had mooted the idea when Madiwala Lake was being made a Biodiversity Park. The idea gained momentum when it found that a lot of garbage and sewage was entering the lake.KLCDA officials had also stated that as people enjoy the scenic view of lakes and builders sell properties as lake view, they should divert a part of their profits under the corporate social responsibility (CSR).They also noted that as the residents of areas around Puttenahalli Lake in JP Nagar contribute money for the lake conservation, the same can be extended to other places also.A senior urban development department official said the idea could be relooked.If lake cess is collected from the people, then they will have a sense of accountability, and this would also help in engaging them for conservation.

Polluted Hebbagodi Lake gets a second chance at life	Strike out from your memory the image of Hebbagodi Lake covered with sludge, weeds and plastic waste. Today, the lake boasts clean water, a children’s park and an RO drinking water unit. Biocon Foundation, the CSR arm of Biocon and Syngene International Ltd, has bio-rejuvenated the 35-acre lake in southern Bengaluru, leading to an improvement in the water quality and the return of flora and fauna. The project was launched following approvals from the Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority (KLCDA) and other government bodies. Before that, the lake was largely covered with invasive weeds. Garbage and sludge had accumulated in it over the years, leading to a foul smell. The revival efforts began in 2016 with a feasibility study of remediation techniques for the lake’s revival.The next step was weeding the lake, composting the uprooted weeds and using the resultant green cover for landscaping around the lake. Several bar screens were then installed at the inlets to prevent fresh garbage from entering the lake. Thereafter, the 1.5-km lakebed was strengthened with native plants such as Vettiver (camel grass) to prevent soil erosion. The last step was fencing the lake. What’s bioremediation? Under bioremediation, the lake was dosed with a blend of enzymes and microorganisms to rapidly digest organic pollutants.Multiple energy-efficient cascading aerators and submersible mixers were installed in the lake to enhance the level of dissolved oxygen in the water.Floating wetlands were deployed for the continuous natural cleaning process. Getting labourers for the rejuvenation was a big challenge. As the lake is located in the middle of Hebbagodi, the narrow roads obstructed sand and material trucks. Workers encountered snakes in the lake.Sewage plant a mustThe lake, however, may get polluted again with the inflow of untreated sewage. Biocon Managing Director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said a sewage treatment plant needed to be installed at the lake or else the whole revival effort would go waste. “We are ready to set up the plant if the government permits it,” she said.“We chose Hebbagodi Lake to do our part to our community first. We will focus on Bommasandra and Kammasandra lakes in future.” The road to revival* Lake size: 31 acres and 39 guntas* Lake inlets: 5 sewage inlets and 2 stormwater inlets* Sewage inflow: 2 million litres per day*Total area of floating wetland: 12,000 square feet*Total volume of soil used for the bund: 67,000 cubic metres*Total volume of bio-enzymes dosed: 3,000 litres per day	lake restoration,Hebbagodi Lake,Lakes in Bengaluru,	 Dec 03 2018
700 families evicted from Bengaluru labour sheds	Around 700 migrant families living in labour sheds at East Bengaluru have been forcefully evicted at the urging of the Mahadevapura MLA.The families, consisting of women, children and infants, were staying in Devarabeesanahalli, Varthur, Kariyammana Agrahara, Munekolala and Bellandur.On the evening of November 30, a couple of earthmovers, with police presence, razed down a portion of the labour settlement at the Munekolala labour camp. Families occupying the shed rushed to take shelter at other nearby sheds occupied by friends and relatives to spend the night. The labourers were given time till Monday to move out.The labour sheds came up on vacant private lands surrounding the lake about 10 years ago when East Bengaluru was witnessing a real-estate boom.Sources said local politicians decided to remove the labourers as they blamed them for the rise in incidents of crime. The police said they did not receive communication from the BBMP, though local land owners and the BBMP should seek police security for such evictions.“Even if the communication had come from BBMP, we wouldn’t have had time to gather a large force to offer security,” a senior police official said.About 700 families occupy these sheds, including infants, children and women, numbering around 7,000. The sheds are fanned out across the city’s eastern parts.A majority of these migrants are from West Bengal and Odisha, while a good number have also arrived here through the porous Bangladeshi borders in search of work.Sources said politicians regarded the settlement as a vote bank, while local leaders help them get Aadhaar cards and voter identification during election time.Post the election, local leaders studied the voting pattern among the settlers and found that the majority from West Bengal and Odisha voted for the Congress as the grand old party pledged its alliance with (West Bengal Chief Minister) Mamata Banerjee. Barely a few illegal Bangladeshis voted for the BJP out of loyalty.Clearly unhappy, political leaders threw the migrants out of their shelters with a deadline to leave by Monday, sources said. Human rights activists and those working for economically weaker sections point out that the migrants have no other place to go. “There are infants and elderly people, too, among them,” said Khaleem Ullah, an activist with Movement for Justice. “They are evicted at a time when it is severely cold at night. Where’ll they find shelter?”	Labour sheds,Migrants,East Bengaluru,Evicted,	 Dec 03 2018
Tree census reveals rare species	"Members of a citizens' forum on Sunday held a tree census in Indiranagar by mapping their presence in each street.A 14-member team of students and residents, belonging to 'I Change Indiranagar' counted nearly 500 trees of different species in Defence Colony, Indiranagar.""The purpose is to be aware of the different species of trees planted several decades ago when the layout was formed,"" said Kannan A S, a member of the forum. ""Since there's no proper data of the trees, the census would document the trees in the neighbourhood, which will help residents save and protect them.""The team identified trees on every street, its location and health. They also recorded the tree's girth, height and species it belongs to, among other details.On the first day of the census, they found Avenue trees, Copper Pot trees, African Tulip, Rain trees and some of the rarest varieties like Arjuna tree and Sacred tree, also known as the Flame of the Forest.""After gathering data, if a tree requires immediate medical attention, the volunteers will immediately attend to it. For this project, we are taking the help of Gubbi Labs, a research organisation working towards sustainable ecosystems,"" Kannan explained.Tree walkTo acquaint local residents with the trees in their neighbourhood, 'I Change Indiranagar' is planning a 'Residents Tree Walk'.Kannan said: ""After the tree census, we intend to undertake a tree walk.

Women from slums trained to be cab drivers	When Sukanya lost her husband two years ago, the mother-of-two struggled to find the money to support her family and educate her sons.Having been trained as a driver, Sukanya now stands a chance to be hired by one of the city-based cab aggregators.“I’ve an identity now and can be a role model for several women,” Sukanya said.She was among 15 women in the city to get trained as drivers by Bengaluru-based NGO Action Aid and DXC Technology. In all, 60 women from Bengaluru and Jaipur hailing from low-income families have benefited from this training.Sumukha (name changed), who earned a living by sweeping streets, is also a recipient of the training, as are women who previously worked in garment factories and rolled agarbatis.“Our family depended on my husband’s income,” said Praveena, another woman trainee. “I had a fear that I wouldn’t be able to educate my children. This training has given me hope.”Malar, the programme manager with Action Aid, said the trainees will soon be recruited by cab aggregators. “The city has a very few women cab drivers. There’re several job opportunities for them and this will also help them earn more money,” she said, adding that cab aggregators Go ink and Taxshe will hire them.“Our primary objective is to provide an opportunity to women from deprived communities to explore alternative livelihood to lead a dignified life. We’re proud of the women who’ve taken the brave step to break the gender stereotype and serve the society by ensuring safety for women and girl children,” Malar added.	women achievers,cab drivers,	 Dec 02 2018
Indiranagar residents to map trees	Members of ‘I Change Indiranagar’, a citizens’ forum, plan to conduct a tree census in the area much before the civic body could take up such activity across the city.The residents will take up the drive during weekends, beginning from December 2.With an aim to bring in an accountability for the number of trees the locality houses, the project involves mapping of trees in each street.“Most of the trees that we see today were planted decades ago when the layout was formed. However, there is no account of the number of trees existing, and that which have been axed or fallen down. The census will collaborate all such data,” said Sneha Nandihal, president, BM Kaval Resident’s Welfare Association.“It all began after we witnessed incidents where a tree fell on a motorist, injuring several people, and also building owners appealing to the civic body to axe trees for construction purposes or to put up hoardings, where the Palike had indeed given permission to chop them,” recalls Sneha.The project would involve 10 volunteers, who will identify trees on every street, its location and assess the health. They will also record details such as the girth, height, locating the species and so on.After gathering data, if a tree requires immediate medical attention, the volunteers will help in fulfilling those needs.“We are taking the help of Gubbi Labs, a research organisation working towards sustainable ecosystems, for the project. Some students from a local college will also be involved,” said Kannan A S, another member of the forum.When asked why the residents are taking up the activity independently even though the civic body would soon take up the drive, Sneha said: “This is an independent activity we have been planning for a long time. We would be happy to share the information gathered with the civic body.”	tree census,Indiranagar,I Change Indiranagar,	 Nov 30 2018
Cubbon Park to have four times more bamboo trees	The horticulture department will plant four times the number of bamboo trees it removed in Cubbon Park, as the trees would improve the air quality and restore greenery in the Central Business District.The department is removing 200 bamboo stems and are replacing them with 400 trees in the first phase and has plans to plant 400 more saplings in phase 2. It hopes that the trees will be tall enough to give a greener look to the park by January.“Of over 300 species of bamboo, 12 that are suitable for Bengaluru will be planted at Cubbon Park. The entire plantation process would cost just Rs 1 lakh,” said Mahantesh Murgod, deputy director, horticulture department (Cubbon Park).Among the tree species chosen are those growing in the Western Ghats, Kerala and Assam.They include Bambusa bamboo, Indocalamus bamboo, Tulda bamboo, Dendrocala bamboo, Ochlandra bamboo and Myanmar (Burma) bamboo.Though the department had plans to plant other native trees, it finally settled on bamboo since city residents have fond memories of the tree. Besides, bamboo also grows faster and looks pleasing to the eyes.The department has also planned to create a system to grow bamboo and also educate people on several varieties of bamboo trees.Extensive survey Officials from the department and experts scoured several nurseries and institutes across the nation for the right kind of species that would suit Bengaluru’s conditions.While the saplings planted in the park are one to three metres tall, they would rapidly grow to 12 feet in a month’s time.Noted environmentalist and member of the horticulture department’s expert committee A N Yellappa Reddy said bamboo has been chosen over other kind of trees since it grows faster and uses little water.Bamboos have monocot roots, which, unlike the tap roots in the other trees, grow only up to a metre deep inside the earth and are ideal to be grown in the city centre.Reddy said the area needs bamboo since water evaporation from its trees are less compared to other tree varieties, while they also release a large amount of oxygen, which is much needed in the CBD area.Murgod said tree data will be collected in Cubbon Park after the exercise to digitise flora in the Lalbagh Botanical Garden ends.All trees, including the bamboo clusters, will be digitised. A tree census has already been completed in Cubbon Park and digitisation will be the next step.	Bamboo trees,Cubbon Park,Horticulture Department,	 Nov 30 2018
HC notices to govt, members of  Dharmaraya temple 	The High Court of Karnataka has issued notices to the state government and some members of the managing committee of Dharmaraya Swamy temple that organises the annual Karaga festival.Justice B Veerappa was hearing a petition filed by B A Krishnamurthy, a resident of Doddamavalli, who has challenged the appointment of some members to the managing committee of the temple.The court sought for the original records related to the appointment of members to the committee. Krishnamurthy has claimed that political influence was behind the appointment these members as they had produced the recommendation letters issued by legislator H M Revanna and others. According to him, even though he was an aspirant with a clean image, without considering it and without affording an opportunity of hearing, the members of the committee were appointed on March 8.The court adjourned the hearing.

Time to ‘go nuts’ at Kadalekayi Parishe	It is time to munch on some groundnuts once again as Bengaluru is all set for the much awaited and historic annual groundnut festival -- the Kadalekayi Parishe. Planning for a zero-garbage event, the BBMP has banned the use of plastic during the three-day festival.The fair will begin after a formal pooja at the Dodda Basavanna Gudi (The Big Bull temple) and Dodda Ganapathi Temple in Basavanagudi on Monday morning with the Mayor, the local MLA and the corporators in attendance.All the arrangements have been made for the event, said BS Sathyanarayana, the local corporator. “We met with the BESCOM officials and sought uninterrupted power supply for the event. Over 300 police personnel will be deployed to ensure safety at the event. We will erect 10 watch towers for the police,” he said.Sathyanarayana also stressed that initiatives are on to spread awareness about the harmful effects of plastic among the groundnut sellers and visitors. “We have banned the use of plastic covers, we will penalise whoever is found using plastic. Visitors are directed to carry cloth bags. They should not bring plastic covers from home. We have strictly directed the sellers too not to use plastic of any sort,” said Sathyanarayana.He said that the event is more or less similar to that of last year’s. Many cultural events including folk dance, songs and orchestra will be held at the Narasimha Park in Basavanagudi.	groundnut festival,Kadalekayi Parishe,Basavanagudi,	 Nov 29 2018
Now, Bellandur gets exclusive FB page	Residents associated with the Bellandur Lake have created a Facebook page to engage with people and keep them abreast of events and projects.On Thursday, the Bellandur Lake Development Group and Citizen Watch Group created the Save Bellandur Kere page to provide a timeline of all events, give visitors a gist of what happened so far and the current activity at the lake.Sonali Singh, a member of the Citizen Watch Group, said having an information platform was considered the best thing as the lake is a vital waterbody in the city.She said though the page is public, posting of information has been restricted. Right now, only three people have been authorised to write and post information on the page. Sonali also said the information on the page will be shared with the Bangalore Development Authority and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike commissioners.While citizen-made Facebook pages exist for the Puttenahalli and Madiwala Lakes, besides a page for Save Bengaluru Lakes, adding Bellandur to the list is considered important, especially since the lake has garnered global attention.

NIMHANS to host conference on Antibiotics resistance	"Take a good look at the antibiotics before popping it because there is a fair chance your system may resist it.The warning comes from microbiologists who would be part of the 42nd annual conference of Indian Association of Medical Microbiologists (MICROCON 2018) to be officially inaugurated on November 29 by Prof Vinod K Paul, Member, NITI Aayog.They say irrational use of antibiotics available over the counter has triggered an increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR).The conference will focus on spreading awareness over AMR, which is threatening to cause a health crises across the globe and touted as the next big pandemic wave to sweep the planet.Dr V Ravi, a professor at neurovirology department at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) said irrational use of antibiotics, self-medication, irresponsible purchase practices and shoddy use of antimicrobial in hospitals contribute to AMR.“There’s pressure to use the new high-end antibiotics hitting the market for different ailments. If a person develops resistance to one antibiotics, none of the other antibiotics would work. It’s a dangerous situation for patients,” Dr Ravi said.He said patients also become resistant to antibiotics as they consume meat or fish injected with the medicine. “Chicken, meat and eggs injected with antibiotics easily transmit the medicine to human and in some cases result in AMR,” he said.Dr R Ravi Kumar, who heads NIMHANS’ department of Neuromicrobiology, said antibiotics administered for gastro, urinary tract and respiratory infections are gradually developing resistance. “Patients don’t complete the course also cases AMR,” he added.WalkathonThe Microcon conference, the first ever, was launched on Thursday with a walkathon with a slogan ""Stop antimicrobial resistance""."

Diversity at the heart of Indian civilisation: Pranab	Former president Pranab Mukherjee on Tuesday stressed the need for cherishing and protecting the diversity of the Indian culture and civilisation and called for greater tolerance and acceptance of difference.Speaking as the chief guest at an event in St Joseph's Institute of Management, the president said India has emerged from darkness with great effort to become a country seeking donations from rich countries in the early decades after attaining freedom to becoming a donor.“However, there are aberrations. I feel pained and anguished when I look at the television and newspapers which capture the atrocities on innocents. Because we live in a land which preached the principle of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam 5000 years ago,” he said.Noting that diversity was at the heart of the largest functional democracy, he said lack of acceptance and respect towards diversity will make India an artificial unity.The former president also spoke about the rise of protectionism, which is affecting the declarations made by countries regarding world trade. One country may benefit from it (protectionism). But we should not accept such artificial barriers, which hurt many, he said.“Constitution has kept us together. A few months, we are going to have a general election where more than 900 million people will exercise their franchise to elect 543 members of Lok Sabha,” he said, calling upon the younger generation to find solutions to fix the aberrations.

BMRCL seeks $500M loan for airport metro	The airport metro project is set to gain momentum with the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) seeking a loan worth 500 million USD. The BMRCL will also request Rs 500 crore as aid from the Centre. The move comes after a proposal to raise funds through the User Development Fee (UDF) has been put off.Managing Director Ajay Seth said the corporation is looking for the $500 million, ideally in a long-term loan of up to 20 years with a moderate interest rate. The formal request for a loan has to go through the Union government. “We have held a discussion with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The request is yet to be sent to the Union government,” he said.The BMRCL is trying to shore up funds for the project after the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) in June blocked a proposal to raise Rs 1,000 crore through UDF. As per the AERA ruling, additional UDF can be levied after the metro services begin.The corporation will also seek Rs 500 crore from the Centre as per the new metro policy, where the Union government will provide 10% of the cost for a project, raising funds through innovative financing models.As per the financial plan approved by the cabinet, the state government is expected to pitch in Rs 1,250 crore, and the Centre, Rs 500 crore (8.40% of the project’s cost).The alignment of the metro line to the airport is likely to be revised with the BMRCL planning to connect the line at Hebbal instead of Nagavara.

Bengalureans help fight Cyclone Gaja blues	A group of Bengalureans are playing a vital role in facilitating relief efforts for those affected by Cyclone Gaja in Tamil Nadu.The Blue Umbrella is an initiative by a few like-minded individuals from the city to provide distress relief support in various parts of the country. The group anchors various initiatives to support social causes.The Blue Umbrella came together during the Chennai floods of 2015 where they mobilised close to 45 trucks of relief material, along with volunteers. The group raised funds, collected groceries, woolen, clothes, sanitary napkins, water and other essentials.What sets Blue Umbrella apart is the fact that it runs on WhatsApp -- an example of how social media can fuel change. The group has over 160 members who at the time of calamities pitch in by fundraising, collecting relief material and mobiising relief efforts on the ground.“We identify a local resource and coordinate the relief efforts. Many of our volunteers travel with trucks filled with relief material,” said Saravanan Arumugam, an entrepreneur and co-founder of The Blue Umbrella.Madhuri Kumar, a jewelry designer and co-founder of the group said, “The Blue Umbrella stands for protection and healing in times of distress as the colour blue is associated with healing.”“We also faced issues like intervention by some groups and agencies that hindered our efforts towards intensifying our reach. We plan to create a database of local resources, important contact centres and persons, government agencies and circulate them to facilitate immediate help to those affected during calamities,” said Arumugam.“Going forward our plan is to register The Blue Umbrella as a not-for-profit organisation focusing on facilitating disaster relief operations and other social causes ,” added Madhuri.

Matching their steps to the beats of Bhangra and Hip-hop, over 30 children and others with various disabilities dance alongside volunteers to promote inclusiveness.The dance sessions were started as part of an initiative by two brothers who plan to set up an inclusive dance school for the deaf and the visually impaired. Vishnu and Vishal Soman have also set up India’s only annual inclusive dance festival titled ‘Taandav’ for children and persons with disabilities which is being hosted in the city for the last five years. Vishnu, who has been a volunteer with Enable India, wanted to provide an inclusive platform for persons with disabilities to showcase their potential. This inspired him to set up Smileys India that brings together volunteers and persons with disabilities to showcase their talent through the medium of dance, art, culture and sports.Vishnu said, “When you dance, you set aside your ego and dance without inhibitions. It also helps in bringing people together through their love for dance and thus Taandav was born.”Vishal, a photographer, says that he was inspired by his brother.The Soman brothers found through the dance sessions that it also helped in boosting the confidence of the persons with disabilities to a large extent and also helped in improving their coordination skills.The ‘Attam Inclusive dance troupe’ which meets for practice in Cubbon Park comprises of volunteers with various disabilities who learn and practice various dance forms like Bhangra, Bollywood and Dappan Koothu, a folk dance from Tamil Nadu.The volunteer dance facilitators of Smileys India also conduct regular dance classes for the visually impaired and the deaf children at various non government organisations in the city.Vishnu said, “Taandav is the only dance festival in the country where people who cannot see, hear or speak learn and perform various dance forms,”The Taandav festival which is set to take place on December 16 aims at celebrating the spirit of dance with people from all walks of life.The participants include children from children homes, persons with hearing disabilities, visual impairment, limited mobility and those with cerebral palsy and autism who will dance alongside their facilitators and volunteers.

Problems at Lalbagh for daily walkers and joggers	Home to several unique species of flora, the Lalbagh Botanical Gardens is one of the few lung spaces in the heart of the city. Thousands of people flock there every morning for their daily dose of fresh air to begin the day on a healthy note.Deccan Herald and Prajavani conducted a survey among a cross-section of walkers and joggers at Lalbagh last week, recognising their problems. In their reply, walkers listed their problems and sought immediate action.Of the 120-plus walkers and joggers interviewed, 94 complained about the garbage, especially whenever mega-events like flower show or training programmes are held. “Even on normal days, heaps of garbage including leftover eatables, carry bags and juice bottles are seen all over the park. Sometimes, dustbins are overflowing but the staff don’t clear them,” revealed Manjunath, a walker and a resident of N R Colony.Several senior citizens and women are worried about the lack of emergency medical facilities. In all, 61 people complained about the absence of emergency healthcare at the park.“At least during morning and evening hours, one ambulance must be stationed at each gate. Maybe an emergency centre with CPR facility will help,” opined Janardhan, a walker from Sudhamanagar. About 60% of the people complained about lack of potable water points.“The department has banned water bottles in the park. Many of the existing water points go dry in the morning and are unhygienic. Officials must set up water dispensing points wherever walkers sit or stop briefly,” Imran Pasha, a walker from Siddapur said.Walkers also complained about the lack of toilets, especially for women. “The existing toilets are in a remote corner. Sometimes, children and men urinate in the open. More security personnel need to be deployed to curb this problem,” Sudha, a walker from Wilson Garden said.Many joggers and walkers complained about pushcarts selling eatables spoiling the landscape.“The geological monument, where the Kempegowda tower is located, is littered with eatables and food wrappers. Vendors have illegally parked their carts on top of the hillock. Why haven’t the officials cleared them? Also, four and two-wheelers roam all over the park. If officials are permitted to travel, they must stick to a particular route,” Paras Jain, a jogger from VV Puram said.	Lalbagh,	 Nov 24 2018

Lung cancer turning into epidemic: Oncologists	Smoking is the single biggest cause for lung cancer. Exposure to passive smoking is no exception.People exposed to all kinds of emission --including vehicle exhaust and fumes emitted from industries --are at risk, said Dr Niti Raizada, Consultant Medical Oncologist and Hemato-oncologist, Vikram Hospital.She said, exposure to carcinogenic toxins like asbestos and radon; also radiation and air pollutants are other causes for lung cancer. Women's exposure to charcoal smoke (while cooking) was also a cause for lung cancer.“Only 15% of cases of lung cancer are curable at the time of diagnosis. Patients with lung cancer present themselves at a much later stage than other cancers, due to the nature of the disease. If lung cancer is detected by chest X-ray, it is already too late for the patient. The only effective method for screening lung cancer in early stages is the Low Dose Helical Lung CT, where high-resolution images pick up early lung lesions,” she added.Dr Suraj Manjunath, consultant Onco-surgeon at the hospital said “Lung cancer has one of the highest morbidity and mortality among all cancers. It accounts for 14.5% of all cancers in men and 8.4% in women globally. It is a leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide at 22%, which means that one in five of all cancer deaths in men occur due to lung cancer. Lung cancer accounts for 5.9% of all new cancer cases diagnosed in India (both sex combined), while mortality is 8.82% of all cancers combined.”November is 'lung cancer awareness month'. Doctors at the hospital stressed the need for early screening, avoiding cancer-causing environments, and quitting smoking.	lung cancer,smoking,	 Nov 23 2018
Bengaluru's traffic nightmares - the six culprits	November 19 was a nightmare for Bengaluru's commuters. Other than the fact that it was Monday morning, a farmers' protest march near Freedom Park created a dominoes' effect, sending the entire city traffic into a tizzy. The jams brought out the worst in several commuters (the stress might have evoked a fight or flight situation) which at some places worsened the jams. DH lists out six types of road-users who consciously or unconsciously (unfortunately) add to the city’s traffic snarls:1. Those who shift lanes with such flexibility that even a gymnast would be envious of them. Who said that they cannot take the right turn while being on the extreme left of the road? Does it create a traffic snarl? If so, too bad for others. Because nobody can stop them from taking that turn. Reminds me of a chicken crossing the road. 2. Dear chatters who park vehicles on the side of an already jammed road, because a phone call is more important than others reaching their destinations. We wonder if this has happened to them as well when they need to get to a destination, but someone is busy chatting on their phone ahead of them. Wake-up call! 3. Even worse are the road-users who talk on their phones while driving/riding/crossing roads. As they animatedly speak on their phones, they forget that there are other commuters. Maybe we could give them a call to let them know! 4. Direction blinkers are for dummies! 'We don't reveal our plans beforehand' said the driver who took a right turn out of the blue, sending the vehicles behind him to hit their brakes for dear life. 5. The two-wheelers who will just squeeze into a small space, because they can. Scratches on your vehicle, lane-shifting, troubled pedestrians, irate fellow commuters honking at them: nothing deters them. Life is a race, remember? And they are just trying to get ahead of you. 6. Empty autos who trail on the side of the roads because, customers! Whom they will refuse, anyway. But meanwhile, no traffic snarls will keep them from riding the way they want to. Cherry on top: people who park on busy streets with limited parking with such dexterity that even pedestrians find it hard to navigate their way onto the pavement. There might be several more subjects of traffic nightmares. If you think we have missed any, let us know in the comments below or tweet at us @deccanherald with #NoToTrafficJams and #ClearUpBengaluru. Till then, we wish you a happy commute.

BBMP to geotag dog pick-up vehicles	The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is planning to geotag dog pick-up vehicles in the city.The civic body wants to install a geo-positioning system (GPS) in the pick-up vehicles so that it can keep track of the relocation process after sterilisation surgery.The GPS will be monitored through a fleet management app which will allow officials to keep track of the vehicle. Speaking to DH, Randeep D, additional commissioner, (Admin), BBMP, said the measure was aimed at eliminating allegations of irregularities while dropping the dogs back.“There have been complaints that the dogs are not let back in their specific area after surgery, which leads to many problems. This is a measure to bring in more transparency in keeping track of the vehicles,” said Randeep.The BBMP has come under severe criticism from pet lovers, councillors and even Deputy Chief Minister and Bangalore Development Minister G Parameshwara on the rising cases of stray dog menace and botched surgeries under the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme.The civic body is now planning to track the trucks through GPS, along with the project to install microchip collar for dogs, which helps in identifying each dog. The chip will be linked to the software.“We can even go a step further and update information about every dog that has been treated, its area and so on on the BBMP website,” Randeep said.The installation of microchip as collars was first thought about by former mayor R Sampath Raj during his tenure. “We are still working on the cost and other processes,” said Randeep.BlacklistedThe BBMP also blacklisted two organisations for violating norms in birth control treatment. They are Sarvodaya Sevabhavi Samsthe and Animal Rights Fund (ARF).While Sarvodaya Sevabhavi Samsthe was accused of treating dogs with expired drugs, the ARF was charged with several cases of botched surgeries. “The ARF was involved in cost-cutting process. So it was noted that the quality has deteriorated during surgeries,” said Dr G Anand, joint director, animal husbandry, BBMP.He also said the payments to the two organisations have been frozen and that the issue has been handed over to the Animal Welfare Department.

Bystanders at high risk too	Going by those visiting hospitals seeking treatment for eye injuries, it has been noticed that bystanders observing fireworks are injured just as much as the participants. One such bystander was 55-year-old M N Gururaj, who suffered serious eye injuries. According to doctors at Minto Eye Hospital, Gururaj is likely to lose vision.According to data available at Minto hospital, over the past two days of the festivities, 26 people were treated for eye injuries, including three admissions. Six cases were reported on Thursday alone, the last day of the celebrations.At Nethradhama Eye Hospital, five people were treated for eye injuries.Narayana Nethralaya saw 32 cases of eye injuries being reported, one of which was serious. A 40-year-old man from Hegganahalli in northern Bengaluru severely damaged the cornea in his right eye when sparks from a flower pot cracker flew into his eyes. He underwent an amniotic corneal graft at the hospital.	Diwali,firecrackers,	 Nov 08 2018
13-year-old loses sight while bursting crackers	The festive celebrations for Diwali were marred by several unfortunate incidents of eye injuries and burns in the city this year. Thirteen-year-old Sadiha Banu received an eye injury in DJ Halli as she went to check a flower pot. It suddenly lit up and the sparks directly hit her right eye rupturing her eyeball. She was rushed to Minto Eye Hospital where she underwent a surgery.“Banu has undergone a surgery for an eye globe rupture. We have managed to restore the structural integrity of the eye, however, it is doubtful if the functional integrity would be restored,” said Dr B L Sujatha, medical director, Minto Eye Hospital.According to Dr Sujatha, about nine patients visited the hospital from Tuesday for eye injuries and most were bystanders.Monesh, a 7-year-old boy, was also admitted for eyeball rupture to Minto Hospital on Wednesday. Unlike Sadiha, Monesh was a bystander watching an atom bomb being lit. The cracker exploded near him and he suffered a corneal tear in the right eye and lower lid laceration. He too underwent a surgery at the hospital. Divya, another patient with an eye injury, was also admitted to the hospital. Besides Minto, a number of private eye hospitals reported eye injury cases. At Shankara Eye hospital, four people visited with eye injuries caused due to crackers. At Nethradhama Eye Hospital, six people arrived with eye injuries caused due to flower pots and rockets. Doctors from the hospital said that most of the injuries were skin and eye burns and they were treated as outpatients. Of the patients who visited, two were children and two others were bystanders.At Narayana Nethralaya, four patients with eye injuries were treated as outpatients. Three patients were also admitted to the burn ward at Victoria Hospital. Joseph, 27, was sleeping when the mat he was lying on caught fire because of a cracker. According to doctors, Joseph suffered severe burn injuries and will take time to recover. Two children also suffered burn injuries to the face and hands. They are also recuperating at the hospital.Read more:Youth sets off cracker in 3-year-old's mouth in UP	Diwali,firecrackers,	 Nov 07 2018
Shush! Noisy neighbourhoods outdo industrial areas	Noise pollution is turning out to be a threat as big as air pollution itself, if statistics are anything to go by.According to a recent analysis by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), noise pollution is more in residential areas and notified silent zones when compared to industrial areas.KSPCB member secretary Manoj Kumar said it was a matter of worry. He said decibel levels were high in residential areas because of the increasing commercial activities there and the mixed categories of zones.The regulations are more stringent in industrial areas, where there is more discipline in the movement of vehicles, parking and industry operations, which has ensured a check in noise pollution.But that is not the case in residential and commercial areas.In fact, the silent zones — around educational institutions, hospitals, courts and religious places — have become more noisy, said another senior KSPCB official.According to the Pollution Control Board data, noise pollution was 57.5% more in the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (Nimhans), which is a sensitive area, in the month of September.It was 19.3% high in Teri Office, Domlur, a residential area; 52% more in BTM layout, 17.1% more in SG Halli; 10.3% more on Church Street; 15% at Yeshwanthpur police station and within limits at Whitefield and Peenya Industrial area. These levels were recorded at night when traffic tends to be less.As per standards, noise pollution levels in residential areas should be 55 decibels, 65 in commercial areas, 50 in sensitive areas and 75 in industrial areas.Air pollution also highResidential areas presented a bleak picture on air pollution front, too. Manoj Kumar said while the situation was getting better in industrial areas, air pollution was increasing in residential and commercial areas.This is another indication of the impact that the increasing mixed zones have on the environment, calling for serious action by the government.	residential areas,noise pollution,Karnataka State Pollution Control Board,KSPCB,Air Pollution,industrial areas,	 Nov 06 2018
Citizens dump garbage on beautified black spots	Efforts by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike to beautify the black spots by drawing rangolis did not yield positive results as citizens continued to dump garbage. On the occasion of Kannada Rajyotsava, the civic body joined hands with The Ugly Indian and other volunteers to hold a rangoli festival with an aim to clear at least five black spots in each ward. It covered around 800 black spots.However, citizens were seen dumping garbage right where the pourakarmikas had drawn rangolis to stop people from littering.Pourakarmikas cleared garbage from the black spots identified with the help of junior health inspectors. Once the garbage was removed, the pourakarmikas and residents began drawing rangolis. BBMP officials took part in the festival along with members of ward committees and residents’ welfare associations.Speaking to DH, BBMP Additional Commissioner (Health) D Randeep said: “This initiative received good response from the public. We made sure the garbage dumped on the black spots is cleared within 48 hours.”“But some continued to dump garbage and littered the road. We engaged the marshals and penalised the offenders,” he added.The Ugly Indian group had trained the civic body officials and pourakarmikas to beautify the black spots.A volunteer from The Ugly Indian said: “Rangoli is a great way to prevent garbage dumping and wipe out the black spots. This (initiative) is creating awareness among people with support from the BBMP and their staff.”The volunteer said if people become aware that they should not litter the streets, it would be possible to reduce the garbage black spots to a great extent.

BBMP suspects avian flu for death of Common Coot	The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) suspects that the death of Common Coot, a variety of aquatic birds in Kasavanahalli Lake, is due to avian flu.According to P Jagannath Rao, the deputy conservator of forest, no deaths of birds were reported since Saturday.“Had the deaths continued, we would conduct the autopsy of the carcass to find the exact reason for the deaths,” he said.“I think the deaths happened due to some sort of avian flu. The fish in the lake are thriving. So we do not suspect a high volume of toxic pollutants entering the waterbody, or some deliberate attempt to poison the birds,” Rao added.On Friday, more than seven coots were found dead on the shore of Kasavanahalli Lake in Bellandur. There were several doubts over the cause of deaths. While a few locals claimed that the birds died because of the involvement of a fish contractor, who might have poisoned the birds, local lake protection group members claimed it could be due to avian flu or the cyanobacteria bloom in the lake.The residents of Kasavanahalli checked all the inlets and outlets of the lake and found that no sewage was let into the lake. The fishermen also said the water in the lake is good and that no fishes have died.Some non-government organisations and water scientists have sent the water samples of the lake to a lab for testing, the results of which will come on Tuesday.Asha Suresh, local corporator, said her team would conduct an inspection on Monday to check if there is any sewage leakage into the lake from the stormwater drain that runs parallel to the lake. “If the sewage is entering the lake, we will take immediate action,” she said.	avian flu,BBMP,Kasavanahalli lake,	 Nov 05 2018
Kidwai hospital to observe Cancer of Cervix awareness 	"Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology will be observing November as 'Cancer of Cervix awareness month'. The institute will also be conducting free screening with free pap smear and HPV tests. The institute will also organise medical education programme on November 24.Caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV), around 1 lakh cases are diagnosed every year in India with an age-adjusted rate of 18 per 1,00,000 population. In Karnataka alone, 5,000 new cases are identified each year. In Bengaluru, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among females with 850 cases being diagnosed every year. At Kidwai hospital, about 1,500 cases of cervical cancer are registered every year accounting to 24% of all female cancers.Dr C Ramachandra, director of the institute said that most patients are diagnosed at a later stage which makes it difficult for their survival. ""There is a general lack of awareness and organised screening for cervical cancer in India,"" he added."	Cancer,Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology,	 Nov 03 2018
Bengalureans fill potholes on their own, set example	As BBMP rushes to meet the high court’s deadline to fill potholes in the city, there are some Bengalureans who have taken it upon themselves to ensure motorable roads.One such person is Dr Sunil Kumar Hebbi who has filled over 20 potholes on Sarjapur Road in the past few months. A small accident on the way to work inspired him to take action with the help of his friends.Hebbi told DH, “A few months back, I had a minor accident wherein the bumper of my car came off owing to the big jerk caused by a pothole. I ended up spending Rs 4,000 to get it repaired. The money that I spent for repairs could have been used to repair a pothole to help others and thus I started doing that.”Hebbi, along with his friends, meets once a week to fill potholes. During the course of the week, they identify potholes to be filled. Following this, they spend two hours over a weekend and fill them using the materials they are able to source.“It only takes a few dedicated minutes to fix a pothole. One can fill a pothole using gravel, sand and cement,” he adds. In another initiative, Prashanth Maruru, an employee at an engineering college started a pothole challenge after fixing a pothole near his house. He shared his story on social media and tagged his friends to follow suit.“I drive a two-wheeler and have faced the perils of potholes in the city. Potholes are one of the major reasons for accidents in the city,” says Maruru.Maruru adds, “It does not take much to fill a pothole. Using simple available material like gravel, sand an cement, one can fill a pothole. It did not cost me much to fill a pothole. Imagine if everyone takes up this task, the city’s roads will soon be pothole-free.”It is not just residents, but even companies have included pothole filling as part of their CSR initiatives wherein they have joined hands with ‘Pothole Raja’ (Prathap Bhimasena Rao) to fill potholes near their premises.	pothole filling,	 Nov 03 2018
Manyata residents fear traffic due to Sunny's event	Manyata Tech park residents are a harried lot with the police granting permission for Fusion Night, an event where Sunny Leone will be performing at the White Orchid convention centre on Saturday.The residents say that the white topping work has already affected traffic and events like these only increase their inconvenience and spoil their area's serenity.Even though the residential locality has an alternative back entry, the major approach road is through the road where the work for white topping is currently going on, the residents say.“It takes an hour to cover a short distance between Hebbal and Manyata flyover because of the white topping work. This program will bring hundreds of people which will cause a huge nuisance in the area. How did the police permit this?” asked a resident.White Orchid and the Manpho Convention Hall in Manyata Tech park host events through the week. To manage traffic movement in and around Manyata tech park, the employees of the IT firms have been issued traffic advisories drafted by Manyata management.“The last Sunday morning, commuters were stuck in traffic for two hours because of programs at White Orchid and Manpho Convention hall,” said another resident. An Abacus examination and an intercollegiate function where a Telugu actor was invited threw traffic out of gear recently, he added.The North division traffic police said that they have been instructed to supervise and monitor traffic movement and keep it moving all the time. “The traffic police would enforce smooth traffic flow. Even if it is slow-moving, our job is to keep it flowing as the developmental work continues,” said Sarah Fatima, DCP North Division (Traffic).Moreover, the traffic police cannot interfere with permissions for an event. It is the law and order police who gives permission to organisers and provides security for an event. The permission had been granted a month back after taking into consideration factors like the weekend when IT employees have an off. Moreover, only over a 1000 tickets have been issued for the closed event, said a senior police officer.However, sources from the residential locality said that despite their requests that programs like these do not get conducted until the white topping work is completed, a minister pressurised the police to grant permission.

Forums talk muck in politics while garbage litters lawn	"This weekend at the Bangalore Literature Festival, speakers and panellists spoke about corruption and ways to tackle the muck within Indian politics. Bengalureans, however, noticed the litter on the lawns of Hotel Lalit Ashok where the fest was organised.It was the most awaited literary event of the year. The who’s who of the literary fraternity and crowds had gathered to engage in intelligent and thought-provoking discussions, but basic etiquette seemed to be missing from the festival.The majority of visitors seemed to ignore the dustbins available every few feet and chose to leave used paper plates and cups on tables or on sides of walkways.“It is an irony,"" said Sonal Kumari, an artist and a ‘budding environmentalist’ (as she calls herself). ""This is supposed to be a hub of well-read, educated people who visit here to enhance their knowledge or contribute to the conversations. Yet, they seemed to have forgotten the very basics of cultured behaviour.” She pointed out how the lesson ‘throw waste in a bin’ is taught to toddlers, but grownups are the ones who often ignore it.“I guess walking a few steps in heels and fancy shoes was a bit too much work for the people here,"" said Kavya, a student. ""I wonder if they were expecting volunteers to walk around with garbage bags to collect the trash like they do in aeroplanes.”At the end of the day, the organisers did create a wonderful platform for engaging dialogues and conversations on burning issues. If only the visitors had played their part."	garbage problem,Bangalore Literature Festival,Clean Bengaluru,	 Oct 29 2018
Now, Bengaluru NGO begins #MenToo campaign	"The #MeToo movement has gathered pace over the past few weeks with a rising number of women speaking out on sexual harassment and support for them has been pouring in from various quarters. Now, men have started raising voices asking fellow men to come out and speak out about instances of sexual harassment that they have faced at the hands of women.A Bengaluru-based NGO has come up with '#MenToo' in order to highlight ""The oppression suffered by men in contemporary times."" It is being described as a mutually incompatible version of the powerful movement to call out male sexual predators in the positions of power.The event came under the spotlight after almost 15 people gathered at Cubbon Park on Saturday to launch a protest inspired by ‘#MeToo’. The organising committee was the Children’s Rights Initiative for Shared Parenting’ (CRISP), which is based on the chief objective of recognising the serious effects of ‘Parental Alienation ‘on children due to single-parent families on account of divorce and separation. One of the prominent faces of the protest was Pascal Mazurier, a former French Diplomat, who was accused of sexually assaulting his own daughter in 2014. Pascal laid importance to the protection of men as well.National President of CRISP, Kumar V Jahgirdar informed The News Minute that the #MeToo movement is an attempt to disrepute men who have worked hard to earn respect in the society. ""If a woman has a case of sexual harassment to report, she should take it up with the police and take the legal route instead of 'naming and shaming' which the people generally tend to do. Splashing it across the social media sites is a complete ‘fruitless attempt',"" he added."	#MeToo,MeToo,CRISP,	 Oct 24 2018
Unsafe in BMTC bus? raise 'Durga' alarm	In order to make public transportation safer for women, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has signed a deal with Dare to Understand behaviour, Respond appropriately and Guard ourselves Ably (DURGA) to install panic buttons in case of emergency.The initiative was done to safeguard women or children, who are travelling in buses against any sort of physical harassment, and the alarms are called 'Durga'.The user can alert the staff and passengers on the bus, through the trigger of these buttons. Pictorial representations displayed helps people who are illiterate as well to raise an alarm. Switches placed on either side of the bus are at a convenient height, where even kids can reach out in case of emergency. The sound is loud enough that even people outside the bus can hear it.As soon as the alarm is triggered, a buzzer beeps for 20 seconds. The driver is expected to stop the bus and check the issue and only after resolving it can her turn off the switch. In case of the switch not being turned off, the buzzer continues to beep every ten seconds. In addition to the sound, it also turns on the flashlights installed both inside and outside the bus, to attract the attention of people commuting on the road.

VIDEO: Tired citizens dance to tunes of bad footpaths	"Garbage issues, traffic snarls, potholes and missing footpaths - the issues haunting the city are many and Bengalureans have always found novel ways to deal with them.The latest one is a video of people putting their best feet forward to highlight the pathetic state of footpaths and the lack of them. The video was widely liked and shared on social media after it was uploaded on Oct. 16.The video - 'Bharatnatya Saaku, #FootPathBeku' - created by members of an informal citizens' group, Malleshwaram Social, is sarcastic, funny and nicely drives home the message. It begins with two women on a road missing a footpath that's covered with construction debris. Dejected, they decide to wear their ghungroos, summon musicians and begin a 'dance' to discover a path to tread. ""We try to highlight such issues that affect the residents directly or directly,"" said Dhanush N, a 27-year-old techie and member of Malleshwaram Social. ""Malleswaram is a locality with the majority of senior citizens who need proper infrastructure, especially the footpaths. Six of us began the footpath awareness initiative almost four months back. We decided to add fun and sarcasm to our videos to reach a wider audience and create an impact."" Dhanush is a part of a 10-member team that came up with the #FootPathBeku video. The group organises talks, vocational training, and recently created a children's library in Malleswaram. They are trying to create a bridge between the authorities and the residents for a better neighbourhood. ""The way forward to a better footpath or infrastructure is cooperation between the residents and the authorities,"" Dhanush said. ""Citizens should be willing to accommodate for better roads and footpaths while the authorities need to understand our needs."" This initiative is one of a number of creative ways that citizens have adopted to protest for a better Bengaluru. Baadal Nanjundaswamy, a 'pothole artist,' paints canvases portraying broken roads and potholes to get the attention of authorities. Baadal then goes to the roads and sets up sculptures, live installations and paintings there. In 2015, his sculpture of a crocodile at the site of an actual pothole made the BBMP fix it in no time, reported The Hindu. It also earned Baadal the title of crocodile artist. Similarly, The Ugly Indians group protests by fixing ugly spots around the city. The Ugly Indians are mostly professionals in the 25 to 40 age group who remain anonymous. They respond to media queries only by email. Their mission is to ""spot-fix"" Bangalore, dirty street by dirty street. Their work has inspired the 'Ugliness Challenge' in other cities, according to the BBC. Malleswaram Social, the new kid on the block, has managed to quickly make waves. The group hopes that the unique initiative and online campaign will create awareness among citizens and convince them to play an active part in infrastructure improvements. The #FoothPathBeku video is the first of many videos that the group has planned in the coming days. They will be tackling other civic issues as well. The next question is whether citizens and authorities will make some moves of their own for better footpaths."	Footpath,Malleswaram,Bengaluru,	 Oct 17 2018

'Unplanned growth will make Bengaluru a dead city'	Lakes will soon become seasonal waterbodies as unplanned and unbridled development, coupled with reduced green cover, will turn Bengaluru a dead city, IISc professor T V Ramachandra warned on Friday.Delivering a talk on ‘Lessons of Unplanned Urbanisation: Bengaluru (A dying city with burning and frothing lakes)’, Ramachandra presented the findings from the Centre of Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to make his case.According to the study, the city’s urban cover will spread over 98.5% of the area by 2025 leaving a dismal amount of greenery which will not be able to provide for oxygen for all.“The day is not far when people have to pack an oxygen bottle for their child along with food and water bottle. But people highlighting this are still receiving death threats from those destroying the environment,” he said.Also Read | It's time to get building green and affordableHealth issuesRamachandra said the effect of the bad environment was already visible in society as health issues have soared.“Earlier, only one in 1 lakh people suffered a kidney failure. But now it has come to one in 500 people. Children are suffering from bone marrow cancer. What else do we need to understand the importance of protecting our surroundings,” he asked.Ramachandra opined that the Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority should not have been repealed. “The lakes have been handed over to the minor irrigation department which will not do anything,” he said.Also Read | Green cover shrinks as urbanisation takes toll on BengaluruHe said the government has strong legislative backing in Wetlands Rules 2010 but their implementation remains poor.“Pumping unprocessed sewage water and dumping garbage into lakes goes on unchecked. Destruction of lakes will continue till people correct their own behaviour,” he said.Prof Ramachandra, who had warned in 2016 that Bengaluru would be unliveable in five years, has been an outspoken critic of the nature of Bengaluru's growth and development. He has called out the lack of political will and public participation to ensure that India's Silicon Valley doesn't become unsustainble or unliveable in the near future.Know about sustainable living | It's time to go green in Bengaluru	environment,IISc,Bengaluru,unplanned growth,urbanisation,	 Oct 13 2018

Book fest to attract vernacular readers	Hosting the event after a hiatus of two years, the Bengaluru Book Festival has set its eyes on vernacular languages and aims to attract people from other states by showcasing publications from their native tongue.Considering the humongous migrant population belonging to various states, the festival will not only showcase vernacular publications but also have a section of e-books and multimedia and literary games section to beckon GenNext readers.Starting from October 15 at the Palace Grounds, the festival will go on till October 21. Unlike the previous editions, this years’ festival will focus predominantly on regional languages besides featuring a separate section on academics, including overseas publications.According to B S Raghuram, programme director of the Bangalore Book Festival, more than 200 publications will take part in the festival in association with several other literary publications. “The theme and concept of this years’ festival is that ‘If you want intellectual stimulus, come with children’ so that the young generation is also introduced to the culture of reading. When kids are being bowled over by mobile and tablet screens, we are attempting to introduce them to the joy of reading,” Raghuram said.According to the organisers about two lakh people will visit the festival. The week-long fest is likely to bring about Rs 10-crore business to the publishers. “There will be a publisher from every corner of the country. We have got publishers from all the prominent vernacular languages as Bengaluru has a huge population of people from other states. Besides, there will be learning and vocabulary enhancing games and material for kids. Religious publications will also be part of the festival, catering to senior citizens.”This apart, several prominent writers from other languages are likely to take part in the book-reading events or discussions organised by the publishers.As part of the festival, there will be 15% discount on books by all publishers. “Over and above this festival discount, there will discount offered by publishers (up to 50%) at selected stalls,” Raghuram said.	book fair,Bengaluru,	 Oct 12 2018

Dasara Dolls tell a story of tradition	A quiet corner in the ground floor of Anupama Hoskere’s house in Banashankari 2nd Stage has turned into a shrine of tradition. As part of Dasara festivities, she has decorated it with over 10,000 dolls.This year she has themed her arrangement as ‘Srinivasa Kalyana’ - depicting that hardships, kindness, responsibility, and compassion are all an integral part of life.Her dolls ranging from 3 inches to 30 feet include various Dasara dolls, goddess Gauri idols, dolls depicting scenes from Mahabharata, Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita.The specialty of this year’s arrangement is the presence of western dolls and South Indian Miniature Brass (utensils and dolls made out of brass).“Every doll in my arrangement is a depiction of a story and a tradition. Many people including children are not aware of the history of the time when brass was predominantly used. I have kept over 30 types of miniature utensils that will attract children,” said Hoskere, Director, Dhaatu Puppet Theater. Some of the dolls are made by Anupama herself. “I have made more than 600 wooden dolls which are also a part of the present doll arrangement,” she said.Symbol of beauty“Not many are interested in arranging dolls for Dasara. Some do not have enough space in their homes or the time to arrange the dolls. But many are interested at least to witness them as every doll is a symbol of beauty and tradition speaking to the viewer through a story,” said Anupama.The exhibition of dolls will be on till November 3 with several puppet shows and performances.She added, “The doll manufacturing culture in the state is depleting. If that is considered prime, then it will give rise to a lot of artists and jobs.”	Mysuru,Dasara,Dasara Dolls,	 Oct 12 2018
Tour to Nimhansto remove stigma on mental health	For the first time in the history of the institute, psychiatrists at National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) have planned a guided tour for the public to remove the stigma attached to mental illness.With many people asking questions, like ‘Do all patients, who go for mental illness treatment, get a shock treatment?’, the psychiatrists have decided to throw open the Institute’s doors for visitors for a day. Department of Mental Health Education, NIMHANS, will be organising ‘Stories against Stigma’ on October 27 where visitors can register for Rs 100 and take a tour of the institute. Based on the response the pilot project receives, more such tours will be conducted once in two months.“It will be open to the public to propagate de-stigmatsation of ‘lunatic asylums’. Furthermore, by this association, we aim to make people feel more comfortable in seeking help for mental health problems as we introduce different perspectives of looking at the stigma attached to mental health,” said Dr K S Meena, Associate Professor, Department of Mental Health Education.Though the public will not be allowed access inside the wards which house patients for treatment, a glimpse of it can be taken. The heritage building and psychiatric wards would be shown to patients.“There is a wrong perception of shock treatment as part of mental health treatment. We call it Electroconvulsive therapy in medical terms. It does not happen as depicted in movies. Neither are the patients as violent as people believe them to be,” said Dr Meena.YogaNIMHANS has developed modules integrating yoga with mental health and research. Besides, for those with mental retardation, bakery classes, computer training is also conducted. The tour will also give access to these areas.	NIMHANS,	 Oct 12 2018
Lalbagh: Female guards to check unruly morning walkers	For the first time, the Horticulture Department has deployed women security guards in a bid to control unruly morning walkers and to ensure cleanliness within the Lalbagh Botanical Garden. These guards will check that walkers they do not carry plastic bags and eatables inside the lung space. They will also keep a watch out for misbehaviour. “While most of the morning walkers coming to Labagh are genuine, there are many miscreants also. We observed for a month and assessed the crowd before deploying women. Initially, we were very reluctant to deploy women staffers. We were worried about the gender disparity and their safety. But we found that it worked,” a senior Horticulture Department told DH.The official said the women stand at Lalbagh main gate and the west gate from 6 am to 7 am. For added safety, male guards and CCTV cameras are also deployed.“We found that many bring biscuits, millets, grains and other food items in plastic carry bags. They feed animals and birds and litter the place. We also found that some people enter the Garden as morning walkers and enjoy free tours and even indulge in illegal activities. When male guards would question, they would be abused and even physically assaulted. But with females, people have started to behave and some have even stopped coming inside,” the official added.This has created a mixed response among walkers. While some are happy with the idea, some say that this is just a method to harass people.“What is the need to deploy additional security, that too woman. We have been coming for years together. Does the department not trust us? This will only create more chaos,” said Shivangi, a morning walker.However P Sadashiva Reddy, President of Lalbagh Morning Walkers Association, said that this was a welcome move. “In fact, we will help them (women guards). This has helped control the menace to some extent,” he said.	CCTV,Lalbagh Botanical Garden,morning walk,	 Oct 11 2018

H1N1 death: Official apathy led to lack of awareness	"The apathy of Bengaluru Urban health officials led to the unawareness about deaths caused due to H1N1 flu at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD).The daily updates on Influenza A(H1N1) were sent by the RGICD to the Bengaluru Urban health section, which however had failed to forward it to the health department.

Three doctors among those infected with H1N1 flu	"About three doctors treating patients with Influenza A (H1N1) have been tested positive for the flu in three different hospitals in Bengaluru.The doctors may have contracted the infection from the patients who had severe symptoms of influenza.One of the doctors from a government hospital said he came to work with a severe cold and by the end of the day developed a high fever and was unable to carry on with his work.His colleague suggested him to send his swab samples for testing, which returned positive for H1N1 flu.“I had seen a few patients in the out-patient department and knew that some had the severe form of flu. After my swab results came out, I realised how I got the infection,"" the doctor said.""It is a first-hand experience for me to go through the symptoms of the infection I am treating. The infection besides having the severe form of fever and cold also had myalgia. It has been a week, and even now I have mild myalgia and cough. The symptoms are sometimes unbearable,” the doctor added.Two other doctors from government hospitals have also been tested positive for H1N1 flu. Among the two, one of the doctors had co-morbid conditions and was hospitalised for a few days.Dr C Nagaraja, Director of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), said though H1N1 flu is a contagious infection, it can still be prevented.""One of the ways of contracting infection is if a person inhales the droplets of an infected person. One will not contract the infection by walking into an H1N1 flu ward, however certain basic preventive measures like washing hands and maintaining hygiene can help curb the spread of the infection,"" he added."	doctors,H1N1 cases,Bengaluru,H1N1 flu,	 Oct 10 2018

Dengue cases have come down: Officials	The confirmed dengue cases in the city have come down, and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) attributes this to the public awareness regarding the disease.The civic body had earmarked Rs 8 crore for mosquito-control in its Budget for 2018-19. It has reduced the fogging exercise as the cases are coming down.According to the BBMP officials, the number of dengue cases has drastically come down.“When compared to the last year, where there were 7,291 confirmed dengue cases reported, this year only 861 cases were reported,” said, Manoranjan Hegde, chief health officer, BBMP.“We carry out fogging in areas where the mosquito density is more. We receive complaints especially from the outskirts of the city. We are fogging wherever we get complaints,” he added.The officials also said his year they got more complaints from Kempapura, Mediwala and East zone.Dr Shivakumar, project coordinator in Public Health Information and Epidemiological Cell (PHIEC) of BBMP said, “the main reason for the decrease in the dengue case is the increased public awareness about the disease and also by keeping the surrounding area clean.”However, the BBMP data shows that the East Zone continues to report more dengue cases. Around 365 cases have been confirmed from this zone from January to September this year.The residents of Indiranagar, Bellandur and Mahadevapura also complain about the mosquito menace.Nalini Harish, a resident of Bellandur, said the garbage mismanagement by the civic authority is the reason for the growing mosquito menace in the area.“The garbage is not cleared and when it rains the mosquitoes start breeding in these black spots,” Nalini added.Sumukhi Deshpande, a resident of Indiranagar, said, “stagnant sewage water in our vicinity is drawing mosquitoes. Despite several complaints, the civic body has not taken action to curb the mosquito menace.”	dengue cases,	 Oct 09 2018

Poor internet connectivity makes it tough for students 	The students of Bangalore North University (BNU) and its affiliated colleges have raised their displeasure with the university’s demand to upload their details to web portals. As most of the affiliated colleges are situated in rural areas they are plagued with poor internet connectivity and shortage of computers in the colleges. “This should be done by the colleges and the university. Instead, they are putting the burden on us. They are aware that rural students lack such facilities, yet they are insisting that we do it for ourself. The internet connectivity is very poor and it takes at least half an hour to upload the details,” said a student of a college affiliated to BNU.The students are a worried lot as the last date to upload the details is on October 10. They are forced to visit cyber cafes in the nearby towns, not only missing their classes but also paying a hefty sum.“The owners demand Rs 150 – 200 to upload each student’s details. It has become a huge burden for students from economically weak sections. Even colleges have a scarcity of computer systems and internet,” the student added.Dr T D Kemparaju, vice-chancellor, BNU told DH, “This move was intended to have all the stakeholders collectively participate. There were instances, where the student would notice an error in the marks card after receiving it. Then he/she would have to run pillar to post to get it corrected. With the new process, the student can enter his/her accurate details and also get the acknowledgement for the same. It is easier to spot where things go wrong.”In the latest process, the students’ details will go through three levels. The first level is with the students, the second with the college and the third at the university. When asked about the time constraints, the VC said, “We are more likely to extend the deadline. Since this is for the benefit of the students we will take a decision accordingly.”	students,BNU,	 Oct 08 2018
‘SC rulings welcome, but life isn’t rosy yet for women'	The Supreme Court’s recent striking down of some patriarchial practices is welcome, but that doesn’t really change the situation on the ground unless people become inclusive, according to activists. Anindya Hajra, of Pratyay Gender Trust, said scrapping Section 377 of the IPC does not end the current complications that transgenders face. “A child still has to face bullying in school for his/her sexual behavioural changes. Nothing can be done unless society fully accepts us,” she said at a panel discussion on ‘We The Women’ here on Sunday. She continued: “Schools should admit transgender children along with specially-abled ones, offering educational opportunities to all. The government should quickly enact the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill.” Masooma Ranalvi, a leading activist against female genital mutilation (FGM), said the impact of the age-old practice was not a temporary occurrence but a permanent bugbear. FGM entails the cutting of a part of a woman’s genitalia to curb premarital sexual desires. “It has a lot of negative effect on the sex life of women once they get married. It was at the age of seven that I fell victim to it and it took me 40 years to realise and understand what had happened to me,” she said. Ranalvi said after genital mutilation, a woman’s close relationships, even with her mother or grandmother, do not remain the same. “My grandmother was the reason for my genital mutilation, but by the time I understood the practice, she was no more.”	LGBT,Supreme Court,Section 377,	 Oct 08 2018
Lake at Hosakerehalli now turns into a dumping yard	Hosakerehalli Lake, where a historic ‘mantapa’ was discovered during desilting last year, has now become a garbage dump yard.“The water body is now stinking. Most of our neighbours are suffering from breathing related diseases as it is impossible to get fresh air in the air. Tenants are also vacating their houses as the situation gets worse when it rains,” said Eerappa, a resident of Hosakerehalli village.In 2015, Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had taken up the rejuvenation of the lake and begun cleaning operations. The lake regained its beauty and soon resembled a bird sanctuary with many migratory birds flocking to it. But the civic body’s negligence has made all the hard work go in vain.A resident on condition of anonymity said the lake has turned into a dumpyard within six months. “We are scared that the lake will overflow after heavy rains and enter the residential areas. The civic body has failed to check the encroachment of the lake bed,” he said.Shivappa, a villager, said, “We have lodged several complaints with civic bodies. Officials are just negligent towards this. We have been keeping an eye out on the lake, but people dump waste at night. As common people how much more can we do?”For the rejuvenation of the lake, spread over 59 acres, Rs 9.40 crore was sanctioned. BDA officials said 40% of the rejuvenation project has been completed and they have approximately spent Rs 1.80 crore till date.“One acre twenty guntas of the lake area has been encroached by the residents. After the tahasildar finishes the marking process, we are going to fence the lake area. Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is taking up the pipe laying project to divert the sewage water. Once it’s done, the water body will be fit to store rain water,” Sumathi, Assistant Executive Engineer told DH.When asked about the deadline for the completion of the project, the official said, “We are going to complete it by March 2019. However, it depends on the rain, which might delay the project.”	Hosakerehalli Lake,	 Oct 07 2018
Study centres on Buddha, Vivekananda & Ambedkar in BU	The study centres on Buddha, Swamy Vivekananda and Dr B R Ambedkar will shortly come up on the Bangalore University’s Jnana Bharathi campus.Recently, the varsity was in news for getting zero admission for the Gandhian Studies, established in 1969.Admitting the failure of the centre in attracting students, Venugopal K R, the vice-chancellor, had said that they would introduce Gandhian studies as a compulsory subject in open electives. This he hoped would help the centre survive, and make the Gandhian philosophy alive among the present generation.“The decision was taken in the syndicate meeting. The aim of establishing the new centres is to make the current generation aware of the values and the preachings of the great personalities,” BU VC told DH.“For now Jindal group has agreed to provide the necessary financial support for the projects. We need books and study materials, and we will have to approach other companies also. The university will provide the necessary land for the centres,” the vice-chancellor said.“Maha Bodhi Society in Bengaluru had demanded the study centre on Buddha. As the Dalai Lama Institute for Higher Education is already affiliated to our varsity, we can expect the students to be part of the Gautama Buddha study centre. We will also make this as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), where this will reach many students,” the vice-chancellor added.The syndicate also plans to make one MOOC course on any of the four personalities compulsory for the student to clear the degree course.“The decision regarding this should be reviewed in the next syndicate meeting. Along with revamping of Gandhian studies, we intend to set up the centres by the December, where students can join by the next academic year,” the VC added.	Swamy Vivekananda,	 Oct 07 2018
3 districts to be free from open defecation	The state government is all set to declare three districts open defecation-free in the state. Work is on to ensure that sufficient toilets are built in four more districts to qualify them for the tag. Principal Secretary of the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) L K Ateeq announced this at a workshop in the city on Friday.RDPR Commissioner Dr Vishal R said works in Chitradurga, Kalaburagi and Tumakuru districts have been completed.“The declaration will come after verification, which is under progress,” he said. As many as 80,000 toilets are yet to be built in four districts of Bidar, Vijayapura, Belagavi and Raichur. On Wednesday, Yadgir district was declared open-defecation free. To bag the “Open Defecation-free,” tag, no fecal matter should be visible and it should be treated effectively, said Dr Vishal.As per the estimate of 2011 socio-economic survey, five lakh more beneficiaries have been added.“We have written to the central government seeking funds for this. They will give us Rs 7,200 per toilet and the state will invest a certain sum for the construction work. It is implemented in 60:40 ration where the Centre bears the larger expense,” he said.RDPR Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said even enough toilets were being constructed, there was a need to bring behavioural changes among people.“We must ensure that the main intention of the Swachch Bharat Abhiyan or any other campaigns directed towards the purpose is not forgotten,” he said. He sought to know why the government was still being held responsible when toilets were built and the people did not use them.“There is a need to inculcate a change in the mindset of the people. Within a month, we will reach the target of toilet constructions.There is a need to reach out to rural masses through internet. It is only inappropriate to think that they are not technologically advanced. With most of country having an access to the internet, messages on hygiene can be spread through social media,” he said.Complaints across the state are common that though toilets are built, they have been rendered unusable due to lack of water supply and poor maintenance, Krishna Byre Gowda added.

Rider dies as bike skids on slippery Shanthinagar road	A 25-year-old software engineer died and his colleague was wounded after their speeding bike skidded in central Bengaluru's Shanthinagar on Friday night, police said. Local residents suggested that the accident occurred because of the bad road which had become slippery following heavy rainfall. They accused the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) of not acting on their complaints about the road's bad condition. Mohammed Azharuddin, a resident of Lakkasandra and a native of Madurai, was riding the motorbike with his colleague Raghu Vishnu, 26, on the pillion. The duo worked for a company on Richmond Road. The vehicle belongs to Vishnu and they were on the way to the Shanthinagar bus station where Azharuddin had to be dropped off. Azharuddin requested Vishnu to let him ride. The road was wet and slippery, and the motorbike went into a skid. Azharuddin fell off the bike, and its handle brushed against his chest. He sustained internal injuries and bled profusely. He was rushed to a hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. Vishnu escaped with leg injuries. In a statement to the jurisdictional Wilson Garden traffic police, he praised the alacrity showed by the driver of a KSRTC driver that was right behind their motorbike. He applied sudden brakes.

No one had attended to him,"" she said.Students participating in the Independence Day celebrations were asked to gather in their classrooms prior to the performance on August 15. The mother, who has sought anonymity, said that she was not allowed to meet her child despite requests.""Why should children be held back in the classroom for so long, especially when it is a holiday and the other students are performing?"" she questioned. She said that none of the teachers had taken note of the injury until she pointed it out.Speaking about the incident, Susheela S, Director, Vishwa Vidyapeeth International School, said, the school had apologised to the parent for the staple pin injury.""It is tough for us to manage so many children at once. It is to facilitate convenience that these children were made into batches and asked to sit in their classrooms while the other students were performing,"" she said.She claimed that the parent of the child had threatened to take necessary action if the school did not respond to her. She also sought to know why the parent had lodged a complaint several months after the incident. ""The child has also been taken out of school. We are only hopeful that incidents like these do not affect the child's education,"" said Susheela.PhotographsYet another aspect mentioned in the complaint lodged with Makkala Sahayavani on October 1 is that the mother's photographs were taken without consent. The complainant has said that during a meeting with the school in subsequent weeks, her photographs were clicked.""I asked them to show me the pictures but I was told that the photographer had left the venue. It was after this incident that I lost confidence and stopped sending my son to the school,"" she said. The school authorities said that during the 'Mother on duty' event, photographs of participants who speak in the discussion are taken and the best speaker is awarded on Women's day. ""Only group pictures were taken during the event. We told her that she could check them herself in the school,"" said Susheela."	child,mother,school,	 Oct 05 2018
BBMP drills borewell in middle of new road	Days after being rapped by the high court over the poor maintenance of roads, the BBMP has chosen to dig a borewell right in the middle of a road, ostensibly to provide water to “the residents” in the area.Thursday morning brought a shocker to residents of Vinayak Nagar of Ward 113 in HAL limits when a borewell truck began drilling in the middle of the road.Anxious residents who took the pain to know the reason for this destruction were told to ‘shut up’ by the local corporator.“We were wondering as to who would permit to dig a borewell on a newly laid road. Some residents reached out to the corporator expressing their concern only to be told that it was in the interest of the residents in the area,” a resident on condition of anonymity told DH.Another resident said if the BBMP was taking up a project for the benefit of the public, at least some of the residents should have been consulted.“There is no issue with water supply in the area, and we never asked for a public borewell. If the BBMP wanted to serve us, they should have at least asked us about it,” the resident said.The residents demanded to know whether it was in line with the rules to sanction drilling of a borewell in the middle of the road.“The very idea of such a project is absurd. It not only obstructs traffic but causes inconvenience to all road users,” he rued.‘BJP workers oppose’However, the project took an interesting political turn when DH spoke to corporator M Chandrappa Reddy.He said those opposing the borewell were not the residents, but supporters of the BJP.“It was close to one and a half months since the locality got water and we drilled the borewell to supply water to the residents. We have taken permission from BBMP officials,” said Reddy. “We are testing if we could get water here. Once the borewell work is done, we will cover the place with cement,” he added.Meanwhile, Prasanna, assistant executive engineer, also said that the permission was granted to dig the borewell.“This place was chosen because if we go too near to the house, the foundation would be affected,” he said.“We have dug up to six to eight inches. It will not harm the road as we will restore it. We have also taken the help of geologists to find the best spot to locate water,” Prasanna added.	BBMP,borewell,	 Oct 05 2018
Bus driver gets involved in road rage,students stranded	Around 40 students, on their way home from school, were stranded inside their school bus for over an hour in Kadubisanahalli after their driver got involved in a road rage incident on Wednesday. According to the police, the incident occurred around 12.30 pm near the New Horizon Gurukul School when the bus brushed against an auto-rickshaw on the busy Outer Ring Road behind New Horizon College of Engineering.The school bus driver, Suresh K (35), alleged that there was busy traffic on the road and the auto-rickshaw driver, Praveen Kumar (33), picked up a quarrel with him for not moving the bus front. He then opened the bus driver’s door and pulling him down started beating him up with a cane, Suresh told DH.Meanwhile, the school students along with a woman attendant Uma Rani started to panic. Four supervisors from the school rushed to Suresh’s help, but Praveen was adamant that the bus along with the students stay there until the police come.When the bus went to an apartment nearby, the auto-driver followed it and stopped it inside the apartment premise. Eventually, the school had to arrange for another bus and a driver to ferry the students home. Praveen Kumar alleged that it was the bus driver’s mistake as he brushed against his vehicle and he was using the children as an excuse to escape from the spot. Suresh said that parents were worried and were calling the attendant to inquire about their children. The Marathahalli police have registered complaints from both the parties and registered two FIRs against each of them. They are investigating further.	School Children,Road Rage,	 Oct 04 2018
Karnataka Hemophilia Society receives N S Hema award	"The Karnataka Hemophilia Society was awarded the N S Hema Memorial award for their service to haemophilia patients on Thursday. Haemophilia is a genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, needed to stop bleeding. Dr Suresh Hanagavadi, the founder of the Society, was given a citation and a cash award of Rs 1 lakh by the Association of People with Disability.A haemophiliac himself, Dr Hanganavadi, said that it was after seeing his uncle suffer from the rare disorder and die a painful death that he felt the need to establish an NGO to help these patients.""When my uncle once had severe pain in the head and tried to explain to the doctor that he could possibly be bleeding, the doctor put his ego first and said that he was not a medical professional to give him advice. He lay on the bench of the medical hospital writhing in pain. It was then that he told me that I should take up the cause. That pushed me to take up a medical degree,"" he said.This year the Association received as many as 30 applications. and five NGOs made it to the top in the screening process.Speaking on the occasion, former Karnataka Lokayukta Justice Santosh Hegde said that working as the Lokayukta was an eye opener for him and he saw a lack of humanism in most places he worked.He said that the definition of democracy as ""for the people, of the people and by the people"" does not remain valid here. Otherwise public interests would have been taken care of. ""If it was so, then the government would have offered all that the NGOs are doing now,"" he said."

Wayanad Calling rally	The people of Kerala have learnt their lesson from irresponsible and unregulated tourism, said K R Vanchishwar, President of Wayanad Tourism Organisation (WTO) on Thursday. Speaking to the media, he said that to ensure the state does not witness another devastation like the Kerala floods, WTO and the state tourism department are now imposing stricter regulations on hotels, resorts and other stakeholders. Construction of high rises has been banned and buildings have been limited only to two floors.An audit report of every site and destination needs to be conducted. The government and other stakeholders are also identifying new destinations for mass tourism. A regulation has also been put in place for wildlife tourism and safari jeeps.While saying that Wayanad district was not badly affected by the floods, he said that it still brought a drop of 60-70% in tourism footfall. In the last three to four months Wayanad alone has faced a financial loss of around Rs 10-15 crore. Tourism is the biggest revenue generator for Kerala and Wayanad.To once again invite tourists to the hilly district, they have organised a ‘Wayanad Calling’ Rally on October 6. Starting from The Lalit at 6 am, the rally will culminate at Wayanad passing through Mysuru Road and Bandipur Tiger Reserve. The rally will comprise 40 superbikes and 25 jeeps.

Ayodha photo exhibition highlights communal harmony	A photo exhibition at Rangoli Metro art gallery highlighted one of the values that the Mahatma stood for all his life: communal harmony. ‘Hey Ayodhya’, featured pictures from renowned photographer Sudhir Shetty’s visit to the land of Rama, explored the Babri Masjid-Ram Temple dispute from the perspective of people’s history.“All my misconceptions about Ayodhya and the dispute were washed away when I met the litigant in the Babri Masjid case, Iqbal Ansari, who was chatting with the priest of a nearby Ram Mandir. Throughout Ayodhya, there is a communal harmony. But the focus on the dispute has left the economy in shambles,” Shetty said.The photographs show Ram bhakts singing ‘qawwali’ and a video features Hindus organising the ‘iftar’ for Muslims, who form only six percent of the local population. “Both Hindus and Muslims in the area are angry with the politicians who rake up the issue every election. They are demanding that governance and development should be the first priority,” Shetty said.Shetty said 800 other Ram Mandirs and several ponds “where Rama is said to have dipped his hands or feet” are in decrepit condition. “I thought people should see through this. If my exhibition encourages them to visit Ayodhya and witness the reality, I will think of it as a success,” he said.The exhibition was one of the major draws among other events, live drawing and painting, public art installation and recital of Gandhi's favourite songs, organised at the Boulevard on Tuesday.

Prajna Yoga helps children develop intuition	Vishal, a Class 5 student, finds playing tennis a cakewalk now. After learning ‘Prajna Yoga’ through the Art of Living (AoL) Foundation he can clearly sense his opponent’s moves.“Tennis is my favourite game. After learning Prajna yoga, I am able to sense my opponent’s moves and my body automatically moves towards the ball,” said Vishal, who was among the 30 children who performed the yoga technique at the Art of Living Foundation in Kanakapura Road on Tuesday.A yoga technique devised by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, it helps children to develop high levels of intuition to enable them to predict, draw and guess despite being blindfolded. “My daughter is a very talented horse rider but she would get extremely nervous. She lacked faith in her capabilities. Within 3 months of Prajna Yoga, she has won four medals at the national level,” said Alka Tej Singh, a parent from Rajasthan. Divya Kanchibhotla, education scientist, Sri Sri Institute for Advanced Research said, “The AoL’s Prajna Yoga is taught to kids between 5 and 18 years of age. This yogic meditation technique enables children to access, cultivate and retain their inherent intuitive capacity.”She added, “Their parents and teachers can observe a positive behavioural change in them. After learning this technique, many blind students have stopped using Braille. They read through obvious sensation. This yoga technique also helps autistic kids to improve their concentration.”	Yoga,Art of Living,	 Oct 02 2018
Youth find it fashionable to lose temper, says Sri Sri	Violence free society, inhibition free intellect, trauma free memory and sorrow free soul are the birthrights of every human, said Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Tuesday. The spiritual leader and founder of the Art of Living said that people should see beyond their prejudice to end violence.While speaking at the ‘World Summit on Countering Violence’ he expressed concern about today’s youth turning aggressive at little matters. “Losing their temper has become a fashion among the youngsters recently. This is due to the influence of films and media. If they don’t have the strength to tackle a problem, they turn aggressive and that finally leads to depression,” he said.Over 30 delegates from across the world participated in the summit organized at Art of Living International Center in Bengaluru. The conference began with emphasizing the power of inner peace that helps sustain non-violence in the world. Experts shared their perspectives on the complexities and nuances of creating a non-violent world. They discussed issues from religious dogma to repression causing strife and shared personal stories of how witnessing violence led to a resolve to make a difference. “In my 35 years as a police officer, I have seen terrorism and separatism of all shades. Corruption is the common thread that runs through most of the problems leading to bad governance. This in turn leads to discrimination and exploitation causing frustration and anger,” said Prakash Singh, former DIG, Uttar Pradesh police. As part of Mahatma Gandhi’s 149th birth anniversary, they also discussed approaches to solve modern day conflicts through Gandhian principles of non-violence.

Gandhi Jayanti: Residents to take up garbage cleaning	"Residents of Hoodi ward in Mahadevapura have decided to mark this Gandhi Jayanthi in a unique way.Implementing Gandhiji's principle of being the change they want, the residents would hold an awareness-cum-cleaning drive in the ward to remove mounds of garbage lying about in the area.Piling garbage has been a major problem in the ward, with the BBMP virtually turning its back on the issue.Waste segregation centres have popped up along the roadside, much to the chagrin of those living in apartment complexes and individual houses. Parents of school-goers are concerned about their health.The secondary segregation of garbage is being done on the roadside since the BBMP has not designated a space for the task.By holding the cleaning drive at all roadside segregation points, the residents of Hoodi will channelise their anger against the BBMP's apathy in a positive way.""These segregation points are closer to our apartment. Hundreds of schoolchildren waiting outside for their buses bear the stench. The odour spreads up to 100 metres,"" said Manjunath B, who resides in an apartment.He said a segregation point has come up very close to a government school in Hoodi. ""I see children from the school clamping their fingers to their noses while passing through the garbage point to their school,"" he said.The residents' association here has written to newly elected Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun about the issue. They say she has assured swift action.BBMP health inspector Seshagiri said a decision on the garbage issue will be made after consultations with the mayor."	garbage problem,Hoodi,BBMP,Gandhi Jayanti,	 Oct 01 2018

As city grows, BBMP stares at piles of crises	The tech capital of India has a population of about 12 million now which is expected to surge to 20 million by 2031. Will the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) be able to manage solid waste with this growing capacity? That remains the biggest concern for the residents of the city.“According to statistics projected by the draft of Revised Master Plan-2031 prepared by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), the population of the city is expected to reach 20 million,” said BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad.At present, the city generates close to 5,700 metric tonnes of waste, out of which close to 4,200 metric tonnes is wet waste and about 1,200 is dry waste.With the growing population and according to projections by the BDA, the amount of garbage is expected to be more than double of today’s capacities.Close to 13,911 metric tonnes of garbage will be generated by 2031, as nearby villages will also be included in city limits.Plans galore, but...Though the BBMP has an excellent plan to collect and process waste, it has failed to implement it, said solid waste management expert Sandhya Narayan, who is also a member of the Solid Waste Management Round Table.“The BBMP has several plans, including the microplan, dry waste collection, and waste processing plants that process garbage at ward levels. But none of them is being implemented. It has to be looked into why they are not able to implement them,” she said.Manjunath Prasad said, “We have studied that the city will have a population of close to 20 million. The projections are done by considering both the core and outer areas. We are trying to strengthen the process of collection and transportation of garbage in the city. We are setting up transfer stations across the city which will bring in mechanised process in the entire exercise. We are also looking at establishing dry waste collection centres in all wards.”The transfer station will also compress the waste once collected and reduce the capacity to half, as most of the wet waste consists of moisture, he said.He also cited several reasons why the civic body is failing to enforce solid waste management rules. “There is a lot of resistance some time as the contractor lobby is very strong. For instance, they want to run the dry waste collection centres and take over the autos that go for dry waste collection. We are trying our best to root out this, and the abolition of contract system for pourakarmikas is one such example,” he said.	Solid Waste Management,BBMP,Garbage crisis,	 Oct 01 2018
Kolar student wages lone battle to save her school	"This class V student of the government primary school at Obenahalli in Srinivaspur taluk of the district is forced to live a lonely school life.Nanditha is the only student in the school which has a single teacher. When the teacher is sent on training, a teacher from one of the nearby schools is deputed there. The third person in the school is the mid-day meal cook. But Nanditha has none to give her company during the lunch time except the teacher.The student wrote about her unique plight to Speaker Ramesh Kumar, the MLA from Srinivaspur, and former minister Suresh Kumar, representing Rajajinagar, Bengaluru in the Assembly. She has urged them that her school should be like any other, where scores of students study, play and share ideas and feelings.Suresh Kumar visited the school recently to see for himself Nanditha's plight. The girl read out a English poem for him: ""Elephant is big, elephant is grey...""Later, in a Facebook post, Suresh Kumar said the girl was actually a student of the government school at Hebbata and was transferred to the Obenahalli school as it had reached the zero-student status and was on the verge of closure.The MLA says there are other schools in the taluk which have two and three students and face the threat of closure. He feels experts and the government must think of ways so that no other child faces a lonely life in school, which should be a place to play with boys and girls in the same age group and exchange ideas.Now, it is a struggle out there for the girl and the teacher at the Obenahalli school to save it from the threat of closure."

Cardiologists adopt alternatives to blood thinners	Amarendra was worried about his father’s health. Suffering from heart disease, his father was on anticoagulants to aid in blood thinning.However, he had a tendency to fall often resulting in severe bleeding. “We came across devices that could replace these blood thinner tablets. They have worked well for him and he is doing much better than before,” he said. The octogenarian does not have to take the tablets after he was inserted with a fairly new medical innovation, Watchman LAA (Left atrial appendage) occlusion device. Cardiologists in the city have adopted the occlusion device and the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug to replace oral anticoagulants for patients suffering from Atrial fibrillation. These prevent the chances of developing stroke, especially among senior citizens having symptoms of Atrial fibrillation.The device is inserted through the groin until it reaches the right atrium. A small hole is made through the septum till it reaches the left atrium where the left atrial appendage (a small pouch) is closed using the device.Dr Ranjan Shetty, HOD and Consultant Cardiologist, Manipal Hospitals, said, “Oral anticoagulants are normally prescribed for those suffering from atrial fibrillation (irregular rapid heart rate that increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications). But its dosage needs to be constantly monitored. Even a slight increase in the dosage, especially among senior citizens, raises the chances of bleeding from any part of the body.They sometimes lose their balance and tend to fall, also causing bleeding. These devices are safe in comparison.”	Cardiologists,World Heart Day,	 Sep 30 2018

Professors star in viral college fest video	A video clip used as a filler between programmes at a college fest has gone viral. And for a change, it’s the faculty who have become the toast of social media.The video by the II PU students of Kumarans PU College, Padmanabhnagar, features the faculty of all departments in spoofs of famous TV commercials. So you have ads of 5 Star (Ramesh-Suresh), Mentos, Fogg — all recreated by the professors of the college, and lapped up on Facebook.The college fest was held in the last week of August and the videos of the event were not uploaded on any public platform for many days.“Our college has a history of 28 years. One of our alumni got to know of the video and shared it on his Facebook wall. Now it has gone viral, as we have our students across the world. Our former students have liked the videos, and the faculty is receiving a lot of attention for their cool attitude,” a senior professor of the college told DH.Chandan D C, an alumnus of the college, admits he is “so jealous of my juniors” who have some cool faculties around.“These activities will actually bridge the gap between teachers and students. Until we do such events, we will not get to know the hidden talents of students and even teachers. I found it very innovative,” he said. The students have come up with the spoof of 10 famous TV commercials, where the faculty of every department has a role to play.Raviraj Bhat, Principal, Kumarans PU College, is as happy as the students.“They listened to us for a whole year... now we, the staff, did as directed by them. And they are all happy with our immature acting. It was the highlight of our fest. The students enjoyed it to the core.We thought of limiting the act to our college, but one of the alumni took it to Facebook. I appreciate the creativity of our students, and I am glad that it reached our old students, giving them some fond memories,” he said.	Viral video,Kumarans PU College,	 Sep 30 2018

Weekend in jail for Duniya Vijay as bail plea put off	A city civil and sessions court adjourned actor Duniya Vijay’s bail plea to Monday, forcing him to spend his weekend at the Parappana Agrahara Central Prison.Vijay’s counsel told the court that serious IPC sections were pressed against his client to prevent him from getting bail. The actor visited the police station with celebrity gym trainer Maruthi Gowda after the latter’s uncle H Krishnamurthy alias Kitty lodged a complaint of abduction and assault against him.The counsel also reminded the court that a case has been registered against Kitty for headbutting his client and vandalising his car at the station. While Vijay’s counsel argued his client could be granted bail, the prosecution objected, stating the actor had a history of assault and granting him bail would hamper the investigation as the actor could influence and intimidate witnesses.The court adjourned the bail plea hearing to Monday.

Bar owner pays Rs 16 lakh for fake licence	The owner of a liquor outlet in Dobbspet has filed a police complaint against a man, his son and another person, accusing them of cheating him with a fake MSIL excise licence. The outlet was recently raided by the Excise Department. Mohan Kumar M C, 45, stated that he paid Rs 16 lakh to Hanumantharayappa, his son Harish H S and another man named Uday Kumar for the licence. He said that he got introduced to the trio at a friend’s wedding three years ago and that they had boasted about having contacts in the Excise Department. They promised to get him the licence to open a liquor outlet in three months and quoted Rs 20 lakh as their fee. They later settled at Rs 16 lakh, which Kumar paid in two months.

My final problem arose when the local MLA of Shivajinagar refused to return Rs 400 crore to me when he did not get the (election) ticket. Instead of returning the money, he started sending his men to my office and residence. I and my family faced danger to our lives. I had to keep them in a village. I am in South Bengaluru but by the time you would be listening to this audio clip, I would be no more. “The only intention behind recording this audio is that I have Rs 500 crore worth of properties in Bengaluru, 30,000-carat diamonds as well as gold. Please take all of this into your custody and pay my investors. But beware of the frauds and pay only genuine investors. By the time you would be listening to this message, I would be gone out of this world. I don’t know what’s happening to me. Sir, please sell off my diamonds, gold and silver and pay the investors. The BDA’s Kumar owes me Rs 5 crore and the Shivajinagar MLA owes me money. Please collect all this money and give it to all the investors.” Starts crying and the clip ends.	jewellers,IMA Jewels,Bengaluru,	 Jun 11 2019
3,200 police complaints and counting	"At least 3,210 investors filed complaints at the Commercial Street police station after an audio clip purportedly recorded by the IMA founder, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, surfaced on Monday. Thousands of investors gathered outside the IMA Jewels store on Lady Curzon Road. They wanted to enter the building but it was locked. Police rushed to the spot and tried to control the crowd. They later told the investors to file complaints instead of protesting. Rahul Kumar Shahapurwad, DCP (East), camped at the spot as soon as the protest began in the morning. He urged the people to file complaints instead of raising slogans. When a man in the crowd wondered aloud whether filing complaints would serve any purpose, Shahapurwad replied in the affirmative, saying that would be recorded and help them get back their investment. Police later set up counters near the Bowring Hospital and the Commercial Street police station to receive the complaints. According to the police, most of the investors belong to the middle class or are small-time businessmen. ""We have deployed extra staff to receive the complaints. The fraud is estimated at Rs 500 crore. People have submitted documents of their investment along with the complaints. Most of the people lost between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 30 lakh. We received 3,210 complaints until 9 pm on Monday and more people have queued up,"" a police officer said. Speaking to DH, Shahapurwad said five teams had been formed to track down Khan and that they were also examining the authenticity of the audio clip."

IMA scam hit the poor the hardest	Thousands of investors who gathered outside the IMA Jewels store on Monday had different stories to tell about the hard-earned money that they invested in the company. Many had invested for future exigencies such as daughter’s marriage, children’s education, house construction, etc. But their hopes of earning profits ended in tears. Mohammed Khalid Ahammed, a 56-year-old contractor, said he invested Rs 1.34 crore in January 2016 after IMA founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan lured him with high returns. In a complaint to the Commercial Street police, Ahammed said the last time he received the monthly profit was in March. Suspecting fraud, he applied for the return of his principal amount but he’s yet to get it. According to Ahammed, the IMA Group also owed him Rs 3.50 crore as he had constructed many buildings of the company. Based on the complaint, police booked Khan under IPC sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating). Basheer Ahammed, a fruit vendor from Shivajinagar, invested Rs 5 lakh for his daughter’s wedding scheduled next month. Speaking to DH, he said he distributed the wedding cards believing he would get the principal amount as well as the profit. He had now sought more time from the groom’s family to arrange the money. Fathima, a homemaker, invested in the company four years ago. The monthly profit would be credited in her bank account in the first week of every month but the payment stopped in April. The company told her the business was hit due to the elections. When she applied for the return of her principal amount, she was asked to come on Monday. Police say Khan’s phone is switched off and suspect that he has fled abroad or to other states. A lookout notice has been issued to all railway stations and airports.	jewellers,IMA Jewels,Bengaluru,	 Jun 11 2019
Politicians, religious leaders backed IMA Group	"One of the reasons behind the meteoric rise of the IMA Group was its founder's proximity to politicians and Muslim religious figures. While Shivajinagar MLA R Roshan Baig is now embroiled in the case after the company's founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan blamed him in an audio clip, other politicians, too, had associated themselves with the IMA Group. In June 2017, then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah inaugurated the Government VK Obaidullah School, which the IMA Group had adopted. B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan visited the IMA Group head office soon after becoming a minister last year. Since the IMA Group claimed to deal in Halal businesses, it was quick to seek the blessings of Bengaluru's top Ulema. Mufti Mohammed Shoaibullah Khan Miftahi, who runs Maseeh-ul-Uloom seminary in Bengaluru, published a booklet in Urdu a few years ago, virtually supporting the IMA Group. Mohammed Maqsood Imran Rashadi and Haneef Afsar Azizi Rasheed, two of the well-known Ulema in the city, backed the IMA Group after the company failed to pay the monthly profits last month. Both of them reassured investors, asking them to remain patient. Previous fraudsIMA Group is the latest and the largest of Halal investment companies to go bust in recent months. In September 2018, Morgenall, a similar company, went bust, leaving investors in the lurch. In January that year, Capital Plus and Capital Infrastructure shut down after duping investors of Rs 300 crore. Previously, Injaz International, Ajmera, Aleef, Aala Ventures, Ambidant, Burraqh and other companies wound up. TV channel in extortion caseIn 2017, police arrested Lakshmi Prasad Vajpayee, the CEO of Kannada news channel Janasri, for extorting Rs 10 crore in cash and a kilogram of gold jewellery from IMA Group CEO Mohammed Mansoor Khan for not running a ""fictitious story"" about the company. Properties worth Rs 1,050 crIn a Facebook post on June 8, Mohammed Mansoor Khan stated that the IMA Group had properties worth Rs 1,050 crore in Bengaluru. ""It has physical assets but people don't have patience, people are greedy, people are anxious, people filled with anxiety..."" he wrote. Heavy discountsThe IMA Group offered attractive offers on its products and services. While IMA Jewels regularly offered a 50% discount on gold making charges, the fee was altogether waived during sales. Frontline Pharma, the company's pharmacy business with over 20 stores, offered a flat 20% discount on all medicines. IMA hospital remains openAmong all businesses run by the IMA Group, only Frontline Multispeciality Hospital, Shivajinagar, remained open on Monday."	jewellers,IMA Jewels,Bengaluru,	 Jun 11 2019
IMA Jewels scam: Fraud in the name of religion	The higher you rise, the harder you fall. This sums up the business trajectory of I Monetary Advisory (IMA), a company founded in 2006 by Mohammed Mansoor Khan. Until 2015, few people had heard of it. Khan, a Gulf-returned Bengalurean, tapped the so-called Islamic investment market to the hilt and quickly built a diversified business empire. As of June 10, when the company suddenly shut down and Khan went incommunicado, the IMA Group had businesses encompassing bullion trading, retail jewellery, gold finance, infrastructure development, housing, book publishing, print media, education, healthcare, perfume and what not. Khan targeted Muslims who shy away from investing in interest-based businesses. The company’s tagline was catchy: Your partner to (the) path of prosperity. Investors were called “sleeping partners”. IMA offered a bouquet of attractive investment schemes with monthly, quarterly and yearly returns. The amount to be invested was Rs 50,000 and its multiples. Withdrawing from the scheme was touted to be hassle-free: get your money back after 45 days. The company claimed to trade in gold and silver bars. At its peak, it doled out a 7% monthly profit. A person investing Rs 1 lakh made a neat Rs 7,000 a month. In a little over a year, s/he could easily recover the entire investment. But this profit percentage didn’t last long. It first went down to 5% before averaging 3% until February 2019. Investors started to panic when the company paid them just 1% in April 2019 in lieu of business for the previous month. Things came to a head in May when many investors didn’t receive any profit. The company’s head office — IMA Tower on Bowring Hospital Road in the heart of Bengaluru — was soon swarmed with harried investors. IMA tried to put up a brave face, saying it was in “sound” financial health and cited the temporary slowdown in bullion trading because of the general elections and the poll panel’s squeeze on investment. It claimed that profits had been paid out to 70% of the investors and that the rest would get it soon. A schoolteacher from Benson Town was among the lucky few to get the profit for April. In May, she received about Rs 3,000 on an investment of Rs 1 lakh.Investors felt reassured but many applied for withdrawal of their principal investment. But the company was in a deep mess. It couldn’t return the money. A resident of JC Nagar who sought to withdraw his Rs 2 lakh in March was promised that the money would be credited by May 15, at the end of the 45-day lock-in period. The date was pushed to May 25 and then to June 5. Then came the announcement that the company’s offices would remain closed between June 5 and June 9 for Eid holidays. IMA promised to return the investors’ money on June 10. But the day began with Khan’s now infamous audio clip. A retired professor of economics whose family invested a total of Rs 6.5 lakh was livid: “This is not Islamic investment. This is pure cheating,” he told DH. “If the company had suffered losses, it should have stated so. We are business partners and must share the loss if any. Why didn’t the company take us into confidence?”	jewellers,IMA Jewels,Bengaluru,	 Jun 11 2019

Also, some unknown person has filed 27EQ return of 4th quarter FY 2018-19 offline on May 7 (possibly at TIN-FC centre). ADA’s TDS Reconciliation and Correction Enabling Systems user ID and login password have been accessed unauthorisedly on May 14.The hackers have not only breached into the TAN login but also changed the user name, password, email ID and even a mobile number linked the certain account. They have even unauthorisedly updated the PAN number of the company belonging to one Aerospace Engineers Pvt Ltd. The police said the compromise could have happened between March and May this year, and came to light recently during verification of the official tax accounts.Confirming the TAN login compromise, a senior official of the ADA said that though there was a breach in TAN account, there was no security concern.“This is not a serious issue since the account was in an open domain. However, no confidential data pertaining to the agency has been compromised,” the officer added.	Cyber crime,Aeronautical Development Agency,hacking,	 Jun 11 2019

Rider, walker killed as bike crash-lands on divider	A teenager died instantly after his high-end bike went up in the air and crash-landed into a road divider on National Highway 7 near Devanahalli, North Bengaluru, on Sunday.

He retired three years ago.Since regulations mandate the ACB to seek permission from the competent authority to prosecute an official within four years of his retirement, the bureau approached the PWD.The competent authority refers to the department to which the official was initially appointed, irrespective of the department he is subsequently deputed to.Regarding Devaraj and the BBMP chief engineer, the Urban Development Department (UDD) and BBMP are yet to respond to requests to investigate.Mahendra Jain, additional secretary, UDD, said permission to investigate was being granted after the minister’s approval. “We will verify whether the ACB has sought permission,” he told DH.The backgroundAll the three are being probed in connection with irregularities in granting TDR while widening the Bhattarahalli-T C Palya Road, along the Kowdenahalli village.The ACB had filed an FIR in the case in April, naming Krishna Lal, an assistant engineer deputed to the BDA from BBMP, as the prime accused. Krishna Lal is absconding.“All the three officials were with the BBMP when the land acquisition took place. The role of the other accused can be assessed only after questioning them,” an ACB source said.	Bengaluru,Public Works Department,Fraud,	 Jun 09 2019

3 approach ACB claiming cheating in TDR process	Three people who lost their land to various BBMP projects have approached the Anti-Corruption Bureau, alleging cheating in the Transferable Development Rights (TDR) process.The allegations are in connection with the first FIR registered by ACB, in which TDR irregularities occurred in Kowdenahalli village of BBMP’s Mahadevapura Zone.ACB sources said the three - Hameed, Mohan and Reddy - had bought sites in Kowdenahalli village in 1989. However, the TDR for the land bought by the trio went to the original owner, as he was named in the RTC, rather than the new owners.While issuing TDR, the officials allegedly concealed the change of ownership of the land. Noting that RTC was still in the name of the old owner, they succeeded in securing General Power of Attorney (GPA) in the old owner’s name and subsequently sold TDR for the land and also the buildings in it.Revenue layout TDR, also issued for loss of buildings, was dependent on the age of the structure demolished for a development project. Circumventing this law, officials involved in the scam forged the buildings’ construction dates to bloat the value of the TDR sanctioned by the BBMP.In the case involving the trio, the accused changed the construction dates of the building by 20 years.While properties in the revenue layout acquired by BBMP were built in 1989, documents were falsified to show that the buildings were constructed in 2009 and were then sold in 2013 for a much higher value.“While acquiring buildings built two decades ago or more, agencies had to provide compensation as per the old rules. In order to bypass the law, the accused forged documents related to these properties,” sources said.Sources in ACB added that more victims of the scam cheated in a similar manner would likely approach the investigating agency in the coming days.

More state officials caught in TDR fraud	The transferable development rights (TDR) scam in BBMP seems to be getting bigger by the day, with investigating officials set to file additional FIRs in connection with the case. With the role of more government officials surfacing, ACB will write to the state government seeking permission to file FIRs against them.Additional FIRs — regarding the multi-crore scam that occurred since the TDR scheme was introduced in 2006 — are likely to be filed during the week. Meanwhile, the ACB has sought relevant documents from both the BBMP and BDA on the number of TDRs issued by the civic agencies.“Soon after the scam was unearthed, several individuals approached us with similar complaints. Indications are that the magnitude of the scam will increase from the initial estimates of Rs 700-800 crore, as more cases are being registered by the ACB,” sources said. ACB sources told DH that methods employed by scamsters to inflate TDR values were also discovered during the investigation. The TDR value, which is calculated by ascertaining the cost of the building lost during any development project and guidance value of the corresponding land, was inflated by changing either the cost of the building or guidance value or both.“Investigation also hints at possibilities of a single development rights certificate (DRCs) being sold multiple times in different zones of the city to benefit certain individuals,” sources said. Such fraud was encouraged by the fact that DRCs did not have a ‘time-locking’ period.Along with it, the delay in the scheme only increased the scope of the scam, according to officials.While irregularities unearthed by officials are in connection with the outer ring road (ORR) project, they suspect that similar methods were employed during land acquisition for Bengaluru Metro and other infrastructure projects in the city.Sources said that BDA, which was entrusted with rectifying unused TDR in 2015, was still sitting on 109 DRC files.

'Metro ‘terror suspect’ is a labourer seeking alms'	The so-called terror suspect who tried to enter the Majestic metro station on May 6 is actually a poor labourer from Rajasthan who came to Bengaluru to collect Zakat, or alms, from mosques during the ongoing month of Ramzan, police said. Sajid Khan, from Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, had arrived with his family and checked into a lodge in Cottonpet. Being new to Bengaluru, he wanted to ride the metro. But as he went through the security check, the metal detector beeped continuously and the security staff stopped him. He was wearing Taveez (amulet) on the wrist and the neck, resulting in the beeping. The presence of coins in his pocket only intensified the alarm. Khan got scared and left the metro station. He took an auto to go back to the lodge. Meanwhile, the metro officials leaked the footage to Kannada news channels, which aired it and branded him a “terror suspect” without verifying with the police. Neither Khan nor any member of his family watch television and had no idea what the Kannada channels were up to. The jurisdictional Upparpet police decided to track down the man in the footage. They stumbled upon an auto-rickshaw driver who told them that he had seen the man. He took them to the lodge. Police picked up Khan on Saturday. When Khan told them what happened that day, the police cross-checked with his relatives in Rajasthan and concluded he was indeed innocent. In a role reversal, Khan filed a complaint against all those responsible for branding him a “terror suspect”. “We have taken up the complaint and are seeking legal opinion to register an FIR,” DCP (West), Ravi D Channannavar, said. Besides the news channels, police will book metro officials who leaked the CCTV footage to the media. “A channel even claimed Khan’s Taveez was a bomb detonator,” another officer said.

Bharani Dharan told him he doesn’t have the change and promised to pay him later. But Selvaraj didn’t agree and got into an argument. 
The quarrel got out of hand when Bharani Dharan hit Selvaraj in the face with the two-wheeler keys. Shekar, a housekeeper at the theatre, rushed to the rescue of Selvaraj. The duo overpowered Bharani Dharan and dragged him into a room where they brutally assaulted him. 
Bharani Dharan sustained injuries on the head and the chest, and soon passed out. 
Seeing the fight, a film-goer called the police control room.

She wanted him to get a non-encumbrance certificate from India to prove that he is unmarried,” he said.According to police officials, Samuel’s former girlfriend residing in Bengaluru promised him to get a certificate and he arrived in Bengaluru on her assurance only to get caught for having an expired passport. “He has been remanded to judicial custody currently,” the officer revealed.Interrogation by the Bengaluru police has also revealed that he was previously arrested in a fraud case in Ukraine. The KIA police have written to the Ukranian embassy to provide more details about him. The police also clarified that he was not Pereira but Samuel.

Sub-inspector jumps metro fare gates in show of 'power'	Police “power” was on display again at Dasarahalli metro station where a sub-inspector jumped over the fare gates and challenged the metro staffers to take action.The incident took place two weeks ago, but came to light recently, days after a BMTC conductor was harassed by police after a woman constable was denied a free ride as she was not wearing the uniform.Ahead of Rahul Gandhi’s visit, two women constables had come to inspect Dasarahalli metro station on March 31. After their request for free entry was denied, they bought tokens and entered the station. The two returned to exit gates after an hour, which had attracted Rs 100 fine.The constables returned with a sub-inspector the next day. “He demanded the reason for imposing fine. The metro staffers were explaining something, but he kept on yelling,” a commuter who witnessed the incident said.According to the rule, passengers who return to the gates an hour after entry have to pay Rs 100 fine even if they have not used the metro.A challengeSources said the sub-inspector yelled at the staffers and said he could enter the station whenever he wants. “The station controller was explaining the rules to him. He was not in a mood to listen and jumped over the fare collection gates. Standing inside the station, he challenged the controllers to ‘take action if she can’,” the source said.The SI’s behaviour shocked many commuters and scared the metro staffers. “The staffers were visibly shaken. Throughout, they were trying to tell him about rules and procedure. He just yelled at them,” the commuter said.A senior official in Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) said clearances for free entry are given by operational control centre in Byappanhalli.“The police do not have free entry. Of course, if they are chasing a criminal, nobody will ask them. Here, the officer jumps the gates only to demonstrate he is powerful,” he said.When contacted, BMRCL Managing Director Ajay Seth said he was not aware of the issue.Deputy Commissioner of Police, North division, N Shashi Kumar, said he would look into the incident and take appropriate action.“I will speak to the competent authorities to sort out the issue.

Man found with 13 live rounds	A speech-impaired man who was found carrying 13 live cartridges at the Mysuru Road Satellite Bus Station has been released on bail after the police failed to investigate the source of the firearm ammunition.

Mahadevaswamy stuttered when Ahmed asked him what he was doing at the bus station. The havaldar checked his bag out of curiosity and was stunned to find 13 live cartridges of 0.22 calibre in it. Mahadevaswamy failed to give any information about the ammunition, and was handed over to the jurisdictional Byatrayanapura police. Police registered an FIR against Mahadevaswamy under the Arms Act and began an investigation into the source of the cartridges.

Voter slips seized from Cong workers	Acting on a tip-off from a rival political party, police seized electoral rolls and voter slips from Congress workers at Majestic on Monday. The Congress workers were found distributing voter slips bearing their candidate’s name and the party symbol. The electoral rolls and the voter slips appear to have been printed out from the election commission’s website. It’s illegal to distribute voter slips by stamping them with the name of any candidate or the symbol of a political party, a senior police officer said. Police are waiting for election commission officials to ascertain if there are any loopholes in the distribution of voters slips and if it’s okay to download the electoral rolls without permission from the poll body. “We have informed the BBMP commissioner, who is on the way. The returning officers have also been apprised of the seizure and they also are on the way. Depending on their scrutiny, a case may be taken up,” said B K Singh, Additional Commissioner of Police (West). Later in the night, electoral officers along with the police raided a complex and allegedly detained 16 people printing duplicate voter IDs, a source said. At least 10 computers and a printer were seized from the third floor of Prabhat Complex, Gandhinagar. They were printing duplicate voter IDs of people who hadn’t voted in the last 15 years. But police denied the raid, adding there were no arrests or detentions.	General Elections 2019,Voter slips,Police,Congress,Lok Sabha Polls 2019,	 Apr 16 2019

Treatment delay could have cost acid victim eye	"Stung in pain and shock after her brother-in-law threw acid on her face, Reshma Qureshi struggled without treatment for five hours. Doctors refused her treatment without an FIR. To make matters worse, her mother wiped her face with a dupatta, allowing the acid to penetrate her skin, while merely pouring room-temperature water continuously would have prevented extensive damage. ""Had the doctors treated me in time, I wouldn't have lost an eye,"" Reshma said at an interactive session organised by Prabha Khaitan Foundation, The Write Circle Bengaluru chapter. Reshma’s story — from a burqa-clad girl in the slums of Mumbai to walking the ramps at the New York fashion show — is documented in the book 'Being Reshma' by author Tania Singh. The book captures various shades of cruelty and how tragedy changes one's attitude to life.Despite a Supreme Court ban, Tania explained how easy it is for an attacker to stock acid and use it against women. ""There are more acid attacks in the UK, but they're against men. In India, the reasons are different,"" she said. ""While acid is freely available over the quota in India, it is banned in the UK."" She continued: ""In India, anyone can buy acid for Rs 40 a litre, cover their face and the number plate of their bikes, and fling it on the victim's face. They can never be traced. In the UK, acid is available only through the battery and the attacker can easily be caught,"" she said.Reshma's acid attack happened when her brother-in-law Jamaluddin tried to set her sister Gulshan on fire. Jamaluddin, who demanded dowry from Gulshan’s family, teamed up with two others and flung acid on Reshma’s face to hurt the family by defacing its youngest member. Reshma was only 17 when the attack happened. DH News Service"	Acid attack,	 Apr 13 2019

Real estate office fire: Foul play not ruled out	Police suspect the fire that tore through the third floor real-estate office in Basavanagudi’s Nettakallappa Circle on March 13 was not accidental. The blaze in Rajarajeshware Builddcon Pvt Ltd in the three-storey Sri Ranga Commercial Complex gutted loads of documents, directors of the company alleged in their complaint to the Basavanagudi police. A senior official said the fire could have been set off deliberately to claim destruction of documents relating to land, joint ventures, sale deeds and other legal papers related to the builder’s business activities. Intriguingly, the fire broke out in the evening when an FIR was filed against the directors of Rajarajeshware Builddcon Pvt Ltd and six other parties at the Kengeri police station. Directors Raman Lal M Sha, Mitesh Kumar Sha and six others were booked for cheating, forgery and using forged documents. Complainant Vishwanatha B N, a businessman from Jayanagar, told the police that he owned two sites measuring 6,800 square feet. In August 2013, Vishwanatha entered into a joint venture with Rajarajeshware Builddcon to build 20 flats, out of which 11 would belong to Vishwanatha and nine would go to the builder. “They forged documents and sold at least six of my flats,” Vishwanatha told DH. “They even pledged those property papers and obtained loan from finance firms. The builder duped me of at least Rs 12 crore.” He accused the builders of deliberately setting off the fire. “They wanted to buy time and hoodwink the police when they investigate (the fraud case) and ask for documents,” Vishwanatha said. A senior police official hinted that the builder could have used the same method to cheat more clients. The fire would allow them to escape police scrutiny. They could claim destruction of documents and buy more time to acquire the duplicates. Police suspect the builders could have shifted some crucial documents to other places. “We’ll investigate the case in detail and explore all angles to bring it to the logical conclusion,” the investigating officer said. What does the MD say?“Anybody can file a complaint against anyone. It was an accidental fire. I have not claimed any insurance. The entire third floor has been burnt, where there was a dining area, locker room and systems. I am not benefiting here. I know the complainant, who is a crook. He is already bankrupt. He has cheated many people and has left his house, closed his office and nobody knows where he is,” said Ramanlal Sha, the managing director of Rajarajeshware Builddcon Pvt Ltd.

Lakshmana murder clues hidden in 3 GB of data	The Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths probing the sensational murder of gangster Lakshmana said the plan to eliminate the gangster was hatched five months ago. The police pored over 3 GB of voice, text and WhatsApp conversations exchanged between Rupesh and Varshini to get to the bottom of the murder plot.B Balaraju, Assistant Commissioner of Police (organised crime wing), said the accused Rupesh and Varshini, who are lovers, hatched the plan in November 2018 after the gangster pressurised Varshini’s father to send her to Cambridge University in the UK in order to separate Rupesh and Varshini. “We had seized their mobile phones and retrieved all the data. We found that the duo had planned his murder five months back and their conversation runs into more than 3 GB of data,” said Balaraju.According to the police, the motive for the murder was not property-related but Varshini and Rupesh’s desire to end Lakshmana’s incessant interference in their love affair. The two conspirators received help from other gangsters who wanted to avenge the death of their gang leader CC Raja.We have asked for five more days of custody of Rupesh and Varshini as we need to interrogate them individually about their conversations, said Balaraju. A senior police officer said Lakshmana had become possessive of Varshini and decided to keep her as his mistress.“He tried all possible ways to spoil her relationship with Rupesh. This made the duo conspire to eliminate him,” he said. Days before Lakshmana’s murder, the accused met in Muthathi, a tourist attraction situated 109 km from Bengaluru. The accused took a room to plot the end of Lakshmana. The police visited the spot and conducted mahajar. CCB sleuths have so far arrested a total of nine accused, including Rupesh and Varshini.Three accused identified as ‘Cat’ Raja, Hemanth Kumar and Akash were shot at and arrested while they were on the run. Apart from these three, the police had taken custody of six accused till March 21.On Thursday, the 1st ACMM granted five more days of police custody of the six accused as the police said they needed to interrogate the accused. The arrest count in the murder case now stands at 12.	Murder case,Central Crime Branch police,Lakshmana,	 Mar 21 2019
TV journo in police custody for extorting Padma awardee	Television journalist Hemanth Kashyap on Wednesday remanded in four-day police custody in connection with an extortion case. Kashyap, input chief at Public TV, was arrested on Tuesday by the Sadashivanagar police after Padma Shri awardee Dr Ramana Rao B accused him and other television reporters of blackmailing him with a fake sleaze video. Kashyap demanded Rs 50 lakh for not broadcasting the video. Worried about his reputation, Rao paid him Rs 5 lakh on three different occasions. According to Rao, Kashyap had called him up on WhatsApp on March 5, saying he wants to speak to him. The same day around 4 pm, he came to Rao's Sadashivanagar clinic and introduced him as a television reporter. Kashyap told him about the video which, he claimed, was with five other television reporters. On March 19, Manjunath, a journalist with Samaya TV, contacted Rao and demanded money, saying he, too, has the video. Rao then called up Kashyap and told him about Manjunath. Rao made it clear to Kashyap that he will pay him all the money he wants if he guarantees that no one else would later blackmail him with the video. When Kashyap turned up around 6.30 pm, Rao motioned to plainclothes police who quickly detained him. Manjunath has, however, gone absconding. Police have confiscated his mobile phone and sent it to the CID's cybercrime cell for a detailed analysis. Police believe Kashyap is not a first-time offender and are reviewing his call detail record to dig more.	extortion case,	 Mar 20 2019

Talking on walkie-talkie, fake cop steals gold jewels	A man disguised as a police officer brandishing a walkie-talkie stole gold chains from unsuspecting women by employing a new mode of attention diversion in the city. Police arrested Syed Abubakar,40, of Chandra Layout, who used attention diversion on 40 women and took away their gold chains worth Rs 50 lakh. He targeted women aged above 50 as they are vulnerable. Dressed in neatly pressed police uniform and holding a walkie-talkie, Abubakar would introduce himself to his victims as a senior police officer. He would tell them that a chain snatching gang was on the prowl in the area. Abubakar would ask the women to remove their chains and cover them in a napkin. He would then give another napkin and offer to drop them till the end of the road. In many cases, he would place the napkin in the bag and make away with the gold ornaments, police said. He would tell the victims to uncover the napkin only after reaching home. When they opened the napkins at home, the women either found empty napkins, stones or fake jewellery. Abubakar diverted the women's attention by talking aloud on the walkie-talkie, which police say, is a new method of attention diversion. He would say a chain snatching gang was lurking in the area.

Pujari's extradition: Senior cop to fly to Senegal	An ADGP-rank officer from the Karnataka State Police will soon fly to Senegal to facilitate the easy extradition of gangster Ravi Pujari (50), who was detained from a barber shop there on January 19.The Ministry of External Affairs has granted clearance to a senior police officer to travel to Senegal to complete the process of extradition of Pujari. Rajneesh Goyal, Additional Chief Secretary, Home Department, refused to comment on which officer will be heading to Senegal and when.Since India has no bilateral ties with Senegal on an extradition treaty, the authorities are looking to extradite Pujari under the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, adopted in 2000, a senior officer said.According to sources, Pujari has hired a top lawyer in Senegal for Rs 7 crore to contest his extradition procedure. Since Senegal does not have capital punishment, the extradition process might require a guarantee that Pujari shall not be executed even if he is convicted under Indian laws, sources said.Indian authorities are confident of a successful extradition process as Senegal is tough on international criminals, with fugitives from Italy and China extradited in recent times. The Dakar police in Senegal had located and detained Pujari from a barber shop in January this year after he was tracked across West African countries with the help of Indian authorities, who received information about him becoming a business partner in a restaurant chain named 'Namaste India'.There are 97 extortion cases against Pujari in Karnataka alone. There are two cases in Mangaluru, from where he hails. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in one case.	Ravi Pujari,senegal,	 Mar 19 2019

Forensic analysis helps crack murder after a year	A murder that was swept under the carpet has been cracked after a year. A 30-year-old woman has been arrested for murdering her alcoholic husband with the help of her lover, police said. According to N Shashikumar, DCP (North), Sukhitha was in an unhappy marriage with Umashankar who often came home drunk and quarrelled with her. Married for 13 years, the couple were living at Dasenahalli, a village near Hesaraghatta in northern Bengaluru. They have a son and a daughter. Frustrated by marital discord, Sukhitha found solace in Srinivas, 31, their neighbour and a school bus driver by profession. The two eventually got close and started meeting secretly. Umashankar got wind of the affair and warned his wife. Sukhitha and Srinivas realised they didn’t have a chance as long as Umashankar was alive and decided to eliminate him. On February 25, 2018, Umashankar got drunk, fought with his wife and went to bed. The children slept in another room. Meanwhile, Sukhitha invited Srinivas over. As the two were having some intimate moments, Umashankar got up and caught them red-handed.He got furious but Srinivas and Sukhitha overpowered and smothered him. Srinivas left soon after. Sukhitha waited until the morning to raise an alarm that her husband wasn’t waking up. As relatives and friends arrived, she told them he had got very drunk the last night and died in sleep. But Umashankar’s uncle Ashwathappa suspected something fishy and called the jurisdictional Soladevanahalli police. A case was registered and the body was subjected to post-mortem. The police probe, however, failed to establish that it was a murder. It took a forensic examination to conclude that Umashankar was strangled. Police changed the course of the investigation and interrogated Sukhitha, whom they had suspected from the beginning. She couldn’t withstand the interrogation and revealed the truth.Police later arrested Srinivas. Both of them have been remanded in judicial custody, the DCP added.	Murder case,forensics,	 Mar 19 2019

When the cheque's due date arrived, Mathan tried to encash it but it bounced. He then filed a police complaint. Madiwala police have opened a case and are looking for Rai.	Fraud,	 Mar 18 2019

10 illegal borewells drilled on lakebed	Desperate to get water, people have drilled nearly 10 illegal borewells in Muthanalluru lakebed. The lake is located near Sarjapur village in South-east Bengaluru.Amid concerns by activists, the local panchayat has decided to launch a crackdown on those who drilled the borewells in the lake without their permission, alleging that nearly 200 tankers haul 5,000 litres of water a day.Being the only source for charging the ground water, the lake, which is filled with water, serves 20 villages in the vicinity.Activists in the area said water tankers ruthlessly exploit the water body. “This’s one of the oldest active lakes in the city,” said Major Santhosh Kumar who lives close to the lake.“Some borewells were drilled near the lake five months ago. Over the last 15 days, more than 10 unauthorised borewells had come up within the lake’s buffer zone,” Major Santhosh Kumar added.He said the offenders secured power to run the motors from Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited saying they need water for agriculture. “Generally, commercial borewell diggers buy land in the lake’s periphery from the farmers to illegally draw water,” he said. Under the Karnataka Groundwater (Regulation and Control of Development and Management) Act, 2011, every borewell in the city should be registered. The notification said violators would be fined Rs 10,000 and/or given three-year prison term.Anekal Tashildar Mahadev C admitted that borewells were drilled in the lakebed without his permission. “The offenders didn’t take permission; nor do they have proper licenses to drill the bores. Our staff is probing the matter and I’ll take action if they’re proven guilty,” he said.An acute water shortage has hit the Mahadevapura zone, including Sarjapura Road. In the last few days, borewells are being drilled on footpaths and lakebeds in Bellandur and Varthur areas.Tankers carrying water from these borewells are possibly supplying water to apartments along Sarjapura Road from Kaikondrahalli to Sarjapura village.	illegal borewells,Bengaluru,	 Mar 13 2019

Girish agreed to pay the money in instalments.Girish arranged the money by selling his ancestral property owned by his grandfather, selling gold jewellery his family had, along with a bank loan and borrowing from his friend. In all, he paid Rs 50 lakh to Sangapura in four instalments from October to December 2017.Following the payment, Sangapura introduced Girish to a senior High Court advocate identified as TC Hanumanthappa who claimed to be close to the KPSC chairman. He assured Girish that his name would be in the first list.The cheating came to light when Girish did not find his name even in the second list of successful candidates who secured a job through the KPSC. When he tried contacting Sangapura, his mobile phone was switched off. After repeated attempts, Sangapura’s aides picked up the calls and threatened Girish with dire consequences warning him not to contact him for money.With no option left, Girish filed the complaint with the Basaveshwaranagar police.“I am not the only victim,” Girish said. “Sangapura cheated many others. When they filed a police complaint against them, he filed a counter complaint accusing them of atrocity by playing on his minority identity. He’d blackmail the opposite parties to withdraw the cases using his lawyers."""	Job Scam,	 Mar 13 2019

Immigration officials uncover major foreign job racket	Immigration officials believe to have stumbled on a racket that aided Indians to get employed overseas by illegal means. They detained three people on arrival at the Kempegowda International Airport who travelled with passports containing fake validations. Labhu Ram, the Foreigners’ Regional Registration Officer (FRRO), said the three, including a woman, had been handed over to Bengaluru International Airport police on March 9. Unable to get a work visa, the three went to Malaysia on a tourist visa and got their passports validated with fake seals by travel agents without them having to get out of that country. Another person was arrested on similar offences on March 1. Police said travel and passport agents had duped the arrested people with jobs abroad. While one agent sent them on tourist visas, passport agents created fake employment passes for them on arrival and got them employed. They affixed fake signatures of Indian immigration officials with fake arrival and departure seals to ensure their clients are not caught in India. On suspicion, immigration officials detained Mithun Bhai Tulsibhai Khunt, 45, a resident of Surat, Gujarat. Khunt arrived at the KIA from Kuala Lumpur on March 9. Officials found his documents had been tampered with. They found that Khunt, a high school dropout, had a job offer from Mumbai Kiran Games as a manager. He flew to Kuala Lumpur on May 19, 2018, from Hyderabad on a tourist visa. But immigration officials denied him entry into Kuala Lumpur on arrival and sent him back to Hyderabad. Undeterred, Khunt flew once again to Malaysia from Chennai and met Jignesh Maaru, an agent from Gujarat. The agent got him a job as a waiter at a restaurant in Malaysia. When Khunt wanted to visit his family back home, Maaru told him he could not travel to India as he was an illegal immigrant in Malaysia. But later, the agent took money from him and got fake arrival and departure seals from Mumbai and Bengaluru, with which the Gujarat man flew back. While checking his papers, officials could not find corresponding arrival or departure documents in their records to match the seals on Khunt’s passport. Chhaya Dineshbhai Gondaliya, 28, an intermediate college dropout from Surat, was also sent from the KIA on a tourist visa to Kuala Lumpur on November 18, 2018. The agent, Jignesh Maaru, received her at KL and promised her a job. Despite staying for four months in the Malaysian capital, Chhaya could not find a job. Since her father suffered from diabetes, she wanted to return to India. Maaru reminded her of her illegal stay in Malaysia and told her she could not get home, but after repeated requests, got fake seals on her passport to enable her return. Hardeep Singh, 25, from Muktsar, Punjab, told officials on detention at the KIA that he paid the agent Kuldeep Singh a large sum for a job offer in Malaysia. On January 31, 2018, Singh flew to Malaysia on a tourist visa from the Amritsar airport. Having worked in Malaysia for more than a year, Hardeep wanted to visit his family. Kuldeep presented him with forged travel documents and got the fake seals and signatures of immigration officials in Delhi on his passport. On March 1, officials caught Jaswant Singh, a resident of Sangrur, Punjab, who arrived with forged travel documents. An agent named Gurjant Singh had also created a fake work pass for him. The Bengaluru international airport police took up all the four cases under various sections of the Passport Act and booked agents Gurjant Singh, Jignesh Maaru and Kuldeep Singh. Suspecting a larger racket, they are on the lookout for the agents.	Job Scam,	 Mar 13 2019

Sandeep Gururaj (38), former finance head of the city-based Manipal Group, along with his wife Charusmita, his lover Amrita Chengappa and Amrita’s mother Meera Chengappa were arrested on December 27, 2018, for siphoning off at least Rs 62 crore from Manipal Group’s accounts.
B Iyanna Reddy, the Cubbon Park police inspector investigating the case said prime accused Sandeep Gururaj had transferred more than Rs 52 crore to Somanna’s account on the pretext of investment, but banks were not cooperating with the police to freeze his accounts.
Somanna, a native of Kodagu, works as a pilot in Qatar Airways. D Devaraj, DCP (central), told DH they had written to the UAE government seeking Somanna’s custody, but there was no response.
“We wrote to Qatar Airways about the fraud committed by their employee, but we just got a reply saying they had informed him about the case and told him to appear before us. Somanna continued working with Qatar Airways as they did not even remove him from service. A lookout notice has been issued to all the airports seeking his arrest,” he said.
Meanwhile, a senior police officer said Qatar Airways replied to the mail because their office on Cunningham Road falls under Cubbon Park station jurisdiction.
Somanna had many joint accounts with his mother Meera Chengappa at various banks in the city. Gururaj would transfer Manipal Group money to accounts of Somanna and Meera. Meera, who had rights to operate the accounts, would route that money back to Gururaj’s personal accounts.
Somanna field an anticipatory bail application stating that if granted bail, he will come to India and cooperate with the investigation. But the bail application was rejected. The bail applications of three other female accused were rejected as well.
Police said the bail applications of Somanna’s sister Amrita and his mother Meera were rejected because he was absconding and had not surrendered to the police.

Pub staff evicts woman for staying beyond close, booked	A woman lodged a complaint against a pub manager who forcibly evicted her and two of her male friends as they stayed beyond stipulated hours.Authorities penalise pubs if they remain open beyond 1 am, but Rakshitha (name changed) and her friends Shiva and Ganeshyam stayed at the pub on Indiranagar’s 100 Feet Road till 1.15 am on March 3.When Farooq, manager of 657 Wall Street Bar and Kitchen, and staff told Rakshitha and her companions to leave the place as it was beyond permitted hours, the three refused. “We usually clear our patrons by 12.30 am,” said Pradeep, the pub’s accountant. “Our waiters told them several times the pub was closed for the day, but the three refused to listen.” Staff even explained the excise department officials would come on rounds and file a case if they found the pub open. But the three engaged in argument with Farooq. In the end, the manager asked his bouncers to throw them out.Shiva and Ganeshyam roughed up the bouncers, while Rakshitha tripped on the stairways and fell. “We couldn’t call the police to evict them because they’d ask us why we kept the pub open beyond the stipulated hours. So, we forced them out,” Pradeep said.An enraged Rakshitha and her friends went to Indiranagar station in an inebriated condition and filed a complaint against Farooq and his staff. She accused them of sexually assaulting her and attacking her companions. The police are yet to summon Farooq and the pub staff for questioning.	woman,pub,eviction,Indiranagar,	 Mar 07 2019

Phone snatchers target Bengaluru's CBD	Mobile phone snatchers have started targeting the central business district (CBD), especially MG Road, with three incidents having been reported recently.The modus operandi is straightforward: Miscreants on bikes swoop on unsuspecting people busy talking/texting on their phones and escape with their phones. According to the police, three such incidents have been reported in the recent past, but shopkeepers and autorickshaw drivers say there are many more which go unreported.One of the victims was Furquan Moharkan (26), a journalist. He was walking on the busy MG Road near Cauvery Emporium around 9.45 pm when a bike-borne duo approached him, snatched his mobile phone and sped away.“This is not the first such incident. I spoke to a few autorickshaw drivers nearby and learnt that another person was robbed in the same style a week before,” Moharkan said.On January 11, Ajith Pai (38), a corporate communications professional, lost his phone on Thimmaiah Road. Pai was speaking on his phone on a dimly-lit stretch around 8.45 pm when a duo on a Honda Activa robbed him of his phone. Pai filed a complaint with the Cubbon Park police.Also read: Phone stolen? Here’s what you can doAfter that incident, a netizen tweeted: “Bangalore is going down the way of Delhi. Soon it’ll also be the city people avoid for safety reason.”In October 2018, an IISc professor was robbed of his iPhone in the same fashion on Museum Road by two criminals riding a Honda Activa. The professor had filed a complaint with the Cubbon Park police.The city police have been unable to trace the criminals but said they had information on a few gangs. “It is difficult for us to trace the theft as these gangs are aware that police will knock on their doors if they use or sell the stolen phones,” said a senior police officer. “If the stolen ones are iPhones, they dismantle and sell the spares in the market. If they are other Android phones, they tamper with IMEI numbers and sell those phones in other states.”	theft,CBD,Bengaluru,mobile phone,	 Mar 05 2019
Families lose gold, cash to fake swamis	A three-member gang took advantage of a few residents’ belief in astrology and palmistry and decamped with their gold valuables and cash on the pretext of solving health and financial problems in south Bengaluru.The Chennammanakere Achukattu police have registered as many as three cases against the accused who targeted several families among which, police suspect, only a few have filed complaints with them.The accused have been identified as Avinash Suresh Khanvilkar alias Guruji, Chetan Dange alias Maharaj and Rajesh Tambe.Police said the accused paid special attention to their looks to lure their victims. Wearing long gold chains and rings, the conmen would observe people visiting temples and keep tabs on them.Later, they would gather information about their health and their children’s education. After getting the basic information, the gang members would begin their operation. The accused would call the victims to a temple and catch them off-guard with the personal information in their possession. Startled by their knowledge, the victims would get convinced of their abilities and do their bidding. The gang would convince their victims to conduct a special puja to address their financial and health problems. Once the house visits would begin, the gang members would ask their victims to bring their old jewellery for puja purposes. To gain their trust, they would return the gold valuables after the puja.Satisfied by their intentions, the victims would approach the accused again to seek solutions for their problems.This time, the accused would ask them to bring all their jewellery, including chains, mangalsutras, rings and other ornaments for puja. They would also make the victims transfer money through Google Pay to their accounts for the puja. After taking all gold ornaments and money, they would switch off their mobile phones and vanish.One of the victims, a 50-year-old resident of Kathriguppe East in Banashankari III stage, on condition of anonymity, said the gang members were partially right in what they said.“I believed that and gave them 170 grams of gold and Rs 1.75 lakh on various occasions,” she said. Apart from her jewellery, she also gave her family members’ gold.Suraj N, a resident of Revenue Layout in Banashankari IIIrd stage, lost 63 grams of gold jewellery and Rs 18,000 cash to the conmen.Another victim, Karthik M, a resident of Revenue Layout, lost 292 grams of gold jewellery and Rs 50,000 in cash.

MD, tax defaulter: Guard’s cup of woes boils over	Ramesh Chandramani (31), a resident of RT Nagar, is an ordinary security guard. With his meager salary of Rs 10,000, he doesn’t pay income tax. So when he received a notice from the income tax department demanding Rs 8.77 lakh for a transaction worth over Rs 2 crore, Chandramani was stumped.A native of Vellore district in Tamil Nadu, Chandramani initially ignored the I-T notice, reasoning that it was not applicable to him. But as warning notices began coming regularly to his Vellore address, he set out to inquire into the whole affair.At the I-T department, a series of shocks awaited him. First, he learnt that he was the MD of Majors SS Capitol Services on Brigade Road. He had an account in South Indian Bank and a transaction worth Rs 2.25 crore had been done through this account.I-T officials asked him to provide documents for his transactions and pay Rs 9 lakh as tax, failing which he would face stringent action.“I felt as of the world had come crashing down on me. I became suicidal but my friends and family members supported me and encouraged me to file a police complaint,” Chandramani said.To uncover the fraud, Chandramani visited the company’s office in Mittal Towers and learnt that the company had shut down. He also discovered that the firm had a CBI case against it. “They did not respond to my queries. In the bank, I found that my signature had been forged. I asked them how can they open a current account without my physical presence and attach my PAN number,” he said.He also tried to find the notary who attested his documents. Looking at the photographs submitted to open the account, he remembered that they were part of the documents he submitted while working as a security guard at JRG Security limited in HRBR Layout in Kalyan Nagar.The firm’s MD, Santhosh Kumar, had also taken photocopies of his PAN card and address proof to open his salary account. He left the company in two months. Later, Kumar told Chandramani that his documents had been misplaced.“Since they were just photocopies, I ignored them. But I did not know that I would pay such a huge price for it after a couple of years,” he told DH.Chandramani went in search of JRG Security but to his dismay found that it was also closed following which he approached RT Nagar police and filed a complaint. The case has been now transferred to Banaswadi police station.“I do not have money to pay tax. If officials wants to put me in jail, I will go as I am already in a lot of debt for attending this case and meeting I-T officials. Action should be initiated against bank officials and my previous MD Santhosh Kumar,” he told DH.	Fraud,RT Nagar,Guardsman,Income Tax department,	 Mar 04 2019

The caller also threatened Nataraja with dire consequences if he did not pay up.A senior police officer told DH that Poojari’s associates identify wealthy targets and watch them and their family’s movements.

Too much FB, Insta: Man kills wife, 3-month-old baby	Facebook brought them together. A year and a baby later, the social networking site was the trigger for a grisly end to the tale.On Jan. 19, Sushma and her baby boy were killed in cold blood by her Facebook friend-turned-husband S K Raju, just three months after the couple started living together with their love child.The reason: Sushma led a colourful social media life. She was active on Facebook and Instagram, allegedly chatting with unknown men. Raju suspected she was having multiple affairs.On Jan. 19 evening, the Reliance warehouse employee who was living with Sushma and their three-month-old baby in a rented house in Madanayakanahalli, planned a bike trip to Hassan.After reaching Mysuru Road, Raju took a deviation inside Hejjala forest near Kumbalagodu. He apparently said that it was a shortcut to Wonderla, which they were going to visit. He then stopped at an isolated spot, assaulted Sushma and bludgeoned her to death. Raju then smothered their three-month-old baby and proceeded to set the bodies on fire with petrol from his bike.Incidentally, the spot was just a few kilometres away from Eagleton resort in Bidadi where a political drama was playing out at the time.The next day, a forest guard on his rounds noticed the half-burnt body of a woman in Hejjala plantation and alerted the jurisdictional Bidadi police, who in turn were busy with the assault case involving Congress MLAs Anand Singh and J N Ganesh.The Bidadi police rushed to the spot and did a scene mahazar (details of crime scene).Later, upon checking complaints about missing people in the city, they learnt that Sushma’s father had filed a complaint about his daughter and infant with Madanayakanahalli police on Jan. 26. He was called to the station and shown the belongings and photographs of Sushma. He confirmed that it was his daughter.Bidadi Police Inspector K Jeevan and Sub-Inspector B C Harish picked up Raju and during the interrogation, he confessed to killing Sushma and the baby. He told police that Sushma was chatting with other men on Facebook and took no interest in domestic chores or taking care of the child.He was arrested and remanded in judicial custody.The police haven’t found the infant’s body. They suspect that some wild animals may have consumed the remains. The area is believed to have a considerable population of leopards.Sushma, a native of Tumakuru, first connected with Raju after he sent her a friend request on Facebook. The chats soon moved to an in-person and physical relationship. She then became pregnant. After she gave birth, the couple started living together due to pressure from their parents.

CRPF man's dog brutally attacks woman	A 41-year-old woman professor suffered grievous injuries after a German Shepherd belonging to a CRPF deputy commandant attacked her in the CRPF campus.It is the second such attack by the same dog at the CRPF campus in Yelahanka New Town, whose owner was earlier accused of negligence.After the attack, the victim, Neha Jain, wife of a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officer, was admitted to a private hospital for five days. As she was bedridden, her daughter Shivangi Jain, filed a complaint on Monday at the Yelahanka New Town police station, seeking action against Ramesh Kumar, the CRPF deputy commandant, 'who let dogs out in the campus where 2,000 families reside'.At about 10 pm on December 16, Neha Jain, a New Town resident, was out on a walk, along with her elder daughter Shivangi Jain and her dog. After covering some distance, they saw deputy commandant Kumar's German Shepherd and Labrador roaming free in the campus.The duo were scared, especially when they spotted the German Shepherd, as the dog had attacked Shivangi just three months ago. They waited for a while till the dogs disappeared from the vicinity. Neha then told her daughter to stay put, so that she would go home and fetch the car.As Neha was on her way home, the German Shepherd jumped on her from the nearby bushes, tearing into her legs and her jacket. She suffered deep bites on her legs and on her back.Neha was screaming and crying for help when deputy commandant Kumar came out of his house. Despite witnessing the attack, he did not command the German Shepherd to stop. When Neha showed her leg with deep cuts and flesh wounds, Kumar allegedly told her, that he was playing with his dogs and he will continue doing it.Soon after, Neha was rushed to the hospital on the CRPF campus, but the doctors said as it was a serious injury, they can't treat her there. She was then asked to go to a private hospital outside. However, Kumar and his family allegedly stopped Neha's car and told her that they cannot allow her to go outside, and tried to block the gate. They allegedly threatened her not to take up the issue further. Neha, with the help of her daughter's friends, managed to come out of the campus somehow, and was admitted to a private hospital near Hebbal. She got seven stitches on her left leg and her stomach. Her husband, Rajesh Jain, an officer with the CRPF presently posted in Delhi, rushed to Bengaluru the next day.Shivangi, the elder daughter of the victim and an eyewitness in the case, said it was not the fault of the the German Shepherd, but it was the officer who let the dog roam freely. Action should be initiated against him, she said, adding that he misused his power as an officer, and did not show any concern for the victim. Kumar even tried to interfere when the complaint was being filed at the New Town station, said Shivangi Jain.Along with the mental trauma, Neha's family incurred expenses of nearly Rs 2 lakh, including medical expenses, her husband's flight ticket fare, and a month's salary.Police have taken up a case against deputy commandant Ramesh Kumar and has charged him under IPC section 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal) and are investigating.

Vishwanath, a resident of Hanumanthnagar said, “When we ask BBMP to clear the mess, officials say they are short of men and machines. Trees have not been cleared even a week after they were uprooted and they are causing a stench in the locality.”When the BBMP forest cell was asked about the situation, they denied there was any shortage of staff or vehicles for the woek.“The situation is because of the unexpected rain. We did not expect it to create so much havoc in the city. We have a team to address these issues. I have also deputed engineers from other zones to clear the mess.

Poultry farmers seek dropping of notification	The Karnataka Poultry Farmers and Breeders Association (KPFBA) on Wednesday urged the Government of India to immediately drop the latest notification — ‘Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (egg-laying hens) Rules 2019’ — saying it would have an adverse impact on the entire poultry sector in the country.The members of the association alleged that the government was heeding the advice of animal welfare NGOs who have little knowledge about poultry farming.As per the new rules, the size of cages at poultry farms should not be less than 550 sq cm per bird and 6-8 birds per cage. It also regulated the use of antibiotics only for therapeutic use and under the supervision of a veterinarian, and called for regular inspection of poultry farms by authorised personnel who should follow proper bio-security protocols.The poultry sector has been given five years to switch over to new systems.“The parameters recommended regarding space requirement, behavioural needs and other welfare concerns are based on studies conducted in the European Union nations, which are not relevant to India. NGOs which have lobbied for a ban of cages have painted a wrong picture of the poultry sector.Healthy birds mean healthy business for poultry farmers and they have been continuously improving practices in farms to maintain hygiene and other conditions. Bird losses for a farmer mean loss of livelihood,” said Deve Gowda, vice-president of the World Poultry Science Association (India Branch).	KPFBA,poultry farming,	 Jun 13 2019
‘Morbid obesity, damaged knee trap patients’	The morbid obesity of a 71-year-old retired man has put the spotlight on a growing epidemic of unhealthy weight-gain, a common feature among India’s adults.The man, an Indian national residing in the United States, has been referred to Manipal Hospitals for a knee replacement surgery, after another hospital had refused to treat him due to concerns of medical complications.Dr Lokesh Veerappa, a joint replacement surgeon designated as the treating physician, identified a larger lifestyle flaw as the bedridden patient used a CPAP breathing machine to compensate for his respiratory problems.“His obesity was at the root of all his (health) problems,” Dr Veerappa said. “He stopped walking, which led to the worsening of his health, and was the onset of depression.” The combination of knee osteoarthritis and morbid obesity traps patients in a vicious cycle of bad health and lack of exercise, Dr Veerappa explained, as the knees suffer early damage and prevent the patient from exercising and losing weight.Dr Veerappa said the patient regained mobility following the successful knee replacement and lost several kilos of weight.A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research–India Diabetes noted how the country’s growing affluence is transforming the health issues faced by citizens. “Under-nutrition due to poverty, which dominated in the past, is being rapidly replaced by obesity associated with affluence, resulting in an estimated 88 million individuals in the country who are overweight,” it said.The study also said 135 million individuals have generalised obesity, 153 million with abdominal obesity and 107 million with combined obesity.City-based endocrinologist Dr A Sharda said the trend that afflicts all age groups reflects the changing nature of the Indian dietary preferences. The shrinking public space for exercise and recreation is a factor in the growing sedentary lifestyle of people, she added.	knee pain,Obesity,Health Care,	 Jun 13 2019

How 2 octogenarians are making toilets at a govt school	"Octogenarians Padmanabha Arkalgud and S V S Rao felt disgusted to see the pathetic condition of the toilet at the government higher primary school in Byrasandra.The school's 160 students have to use the toilet by turn as it has just one entrance. Also, one girl child must stand guard when her school mate goes in.""It was too painful,"" said Arkalgud, who began a crowdfunding drive with Rao to ensure the school has five toilets with separate entrances and running water. ""To minimise the inconvenience to the students, we plan to start the construction immediately."" While the project would cost them Rs 2.75 lakh, the duo had already raised Rs 31,000 donated by a temple trust in Jayanagar. They are reaching out to the public.

Karnataka Jain Association to complete 100 years	The Karnataka Jain Association on KR road, Bengaluru is all set to complete 100 years next week, and will be among the very few associations in the country to mark their centenary.Established in 1918 in Mysuru, the association was initially named Mysore Jain Association. M L Vardhamanaiah, the founder president of the association established it in the Chandragupta Road, in the heritage city. The association shifted to Bengaluru in 1971.According to members of the association, though they hail from Karnataka and speak Kannada fluently, there is a misconception that they belong to North India.“The members of Karnataka Jain Association belong to Digambara sects and we have origins from Karnataka. Since we also use the surname ‘Jain’ some people assume we hail from North India,” Jitendra Kumar, president, Karnataka Jain Association told DH. Jitendra will complete 20 years in office as the president of the association. He has decided to quit and will not contest in next election scheduled in September.Karnataka Jain Association has 8,000 registered members in Bengaluru alone and also has branch offices at all the districts of the state. So far, the association has seen only 12 presidents.The association had become dysfunctional for a few years in Mysuru due to lack of effective leadership in the early 60s. Later, the Jain community in Bengaluru took charge of the Mysore-based association and established it on KR Road in Basavangudi, Bengaluru by providing hostels, halls and a temple for people of the community.During the valedictory function of the centenary celebrations, a book talking about the journey of the society will be released.

Govt school’s walls coloured after whitewash setback	A government school in Victoria Layout, Yalagonda Palya, in the news recently for turning pale with an abrupt whitewash, has gained back its beauty.Volunteers who transformed the school with their wonderful art works in January saw the Election Commission whitewashing the walls on account of the model code of conduct, though the paintings did not have any political significance.The same group of volunteers turned up at the school on June 5 and painted it back to its vibrancy. Marking World Environment Day, the volunteers also planted saplings at the school premises along with the city police commissioner. The saplings planted were named after Kannada poets.Local residents and school students also joined hands with the volunteers from the Shilpa Foundation and Fedilitus Art Gallery, who beautified the school as part of their CSR initiative.“We painted the walls with new art works. Now, it sports flowers, pencil, plants and butterflies, among other things,” Achyuth Gowda, founder, Fedilitus Corp, told DH.He said the volunteers think it their duty to beautify the school once again. “This was like a welcome event for the students who are starting a new academic year,” Gowda said.The company spent Rs 20,000 on the initiative.On whether the volunteers had asked the EC the reason behind whitewashing the school, Gowda said: “Let’s not blame anyone here. The officials have only done their duty. We waited for the school to reopen and now we found the right time to (re-beautify) it.”	government school,Bengaluru,	 Jun 09 2019

Bengalureans leading the way in tackling water crisis	Every summer, water, or rather the lack of it, always becomes the topic of concern in Bengaluru. Recently, 670 Bengalureans signed a petition launched by the Bangalore Apartments’ Federation (BAF) to conserve water through various measures, keeping in mind the current water crisis the city is currently facing. This petition was for the citizens as opposed to the usual address to the authorities.DH had earlier reported that BAF, which represents over 70,000 apartments, had also conducted the BAFHalfBucketChallenge, a social media campaign urging its members to bathe in half a bucket of water to tackle the issue of water shortage. Their objective is to generate consciousness about water preservation among citizens.In this petition, the residents are provided with certain suggestions which could prove to be beneficial considering that Bengaluru is in the throes of a water crisis with erratic supply of Cauvery water and groundwater running dry in several places. Suggestions included installations of smart water meters, installation of tap aerators in taps, simple but effective measures like checking taps and faucets for leaks, using washing machines with only full load, cleaning vehicles without water, collecting RO waste water for household cleaning and so on.There have been initiatives taken up by various citizen-based associations and organisations to collectively come up with solutions for this problem which holds long-term implications.ADDA, a company that offers an integrated apartment management software for gated communities, organised a water workshop, a third of its kind to find solutions to the water crisis. It brought to light several ongoing sustainable water management measures.With a focus on gated communities, representatives of Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), citizen groups and activists met on March 23, at the The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) campus, Domlur, to seek solutions to the ongoing water crisis- monitoring of water consumption in apartment complexes, avoiding the usage of showers while bathing and working with Ward Committees to ensure proper drainage system to name a few. Improvement in utilisation of existing rainwater harvesting programmes and digging of wells to recharge groundwater are essential steps to be implemented.Whitefield Rising (WFR) is a civic group which has regularly made conscious and sustained efforts to rejuvenate lakes in Whitefield and to organise workshops on water management. Their emphasis has been on the need to reuse water and to set up Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in the area. STP-treated water can be used in gardens and car washing and dual piping installation can help in using the treated water for toilet flushing.The theory of ‘Ecowaternomics’ is widely discussed by almost every association aiming to make the situation better for future generations. It looks at the economics of using less water from two angles – using less and reusing more.True to its identity as a tech and start-up hub, Bengaluru has had innovations that could go a long way in tackling the issue at hand. Biome Environmental Solutions is another Bengaluru-based design firm having an expertise in providing knowledge services water management and rainwater harvesting, ecological wastewater treatment and sanitation practices, highlights limiting citizens’ demand for water since relying on the supply side was not a sustainable solution.SmarterHomes by Vivek Shukla (helps users track water usage), OpenWater.In by Sanjiv Sambadan, IISc professor (converts waste water to potable water) and the like have opened up new doors.Importance of individual contributions towards saving water cannot be overlooked. Furthermore, there is a need to engage knowledge partners, authorities and citizens in conversation to bring about real change and prevent the water issue from spiraling out, beyond our control.

Thunderstorm destruction writ large on city landscape	The downpour of the past two nights brought down hundreds of trees, electricity poles and transformers, besides inflicting damage on scores of vehicles and plunging large parts of the city into darkness. The damage was so extensive in northern and western Bengaluru that Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara had to visit many areas on Monday and order civic officials to get cracking. As per the latest count, at least 100 trees and 500 branches have been uprooted. Parameshwara, who visited Vijayanagar, Malleswaram, West of Chord Road and other areas affected by the heavy rain, asked the officials to clear the debris immediately. He also instructed Bescom officials to restore the power supply. Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, Vijayanagar MLA M Krishnappa and others accompanied him during the inspection. Speaking to reporters later, Parameshwara said a total of 61 teams from the BBMP, Bescom and other departments were working overtime to clear the debris from streets and restore the power supply. “The BBMP control room enabled us to be aware of the rain-related problems in real time,” he added. Stating that some parts of Karnataka had received more than 120 mm of rainfall in the past few days, the deputy chief minister stressed that the BBMP was well-prepared for the monsoon that was expected to arrive in Bengaluru in a few days.He said he had instructed the officials at an earlier meeting to take the necessary steps to tackle the problems arising out of monsoon. He said low-lying areas of the city had not been flooded and sought to take credit for that. Parameshwara held another meeting with BBMP and Bescom officials about the rain preparedness, asking the agencies about the steps they had taken to avoid the flooding of streets and the potholes on roads. BBMP officials replied that they were removing silt from stormwater drains and that a premix of bitumen and sand had arrived from Tamil Nadu to fill up potholes. Parameshwara further ordered the officials to clear garbage black spots as these might block rainwater and emit a foul smell leading to health hazards. He also asked the officials of the BBMP control room and other helplines to remain alert throughout the monsoon. Officials said they were planning to raise awareness about the dangers of power lines by conducting painting and essay competitions on the topic for schoolchildren.

Students spearhead menstruation campaign	"A group of 13 youngsters is reaching out to women, spreading awareness on menstrual hygiene. They are persuading the underprivileged to switch to eco-friendly practices. The informal bunch are school students from Bengaluru.Their goal? Every woman should be able to manage menstruation in a hygienic and dignified way.Led by a grade 12 science student, the team calls itself RutuChakra. Sanjana Dixit from the National Public School formed the group in January 2018.Having conducted multiple workshops and awareness programmes, RutuChakra has managed to raise Rs 4.5 lakh through crowdfunding.It all began when Sanjana visited an orphanage early last year and used a washroom there.""I started questioning the awareness level among underprivileged girls. I was wondering if they knew what safe menstruation meant,"" she said.Availability was a question, Sanjana observed. ""When I spoke to the person in charge there, I understood that many donate stationery and clothes. None gave money or donated supplies when it came to menstruation,"" she added.Sanjana believes, along with safety, sustainability is an important factor. As RutuChakra reaches out to women under 18, they are educated about sanitary napkins and are supplied reusable sanitary pads. However, for those above 18, options such as menstrual cups are recommended.RutuChakra has supported over 550 girls and women, distributed 33,000 sanitary napkins and conducted over 11 workshops so far.Sanjana said she was waiting to turn 18 so that she could have her NGO registered. ""For now, I have a team that is passionate -- school students from various backgrounds,"" she said.Sanjana hopes to pursue a career in either molecular biology or biotechnology."

Ouch! Itching powder available for Rs 50 online	"It could be used to play a prank or to mug an innocent passerby, but the alarming thing about the itching powder is that people can get it online. Weeks ago, the city woke up to the news that a gang using itching powder to steal is back in business, but no regulation is in place as the e-commerce sites are selling them for anyone. Sold in names like ‘itching powder’ or ‘itch powder’, the substance is touted by e-commerce portals as something to play pranks with. While anyone can get them for as little as Rs 50, doctors warn that the chemicals in the powder can be potentially harmful. City-based paediatrician Dr Manjunath Sharma believed it could be safe to use powders that contain natural ingredients as mentioned online, but the ones with chemicals could aggravate allergies as it caused persistent itching.“We’re not aware of the long-term side effects,” he said. While in some cases it leaves severe irritation, it could create permanent scars in others, Dr Girish M S, Head, Department of Dermatology, ESIC Rajajinagar. ""It is shocking that this is even available online. Although the main purpose could be a prank, there should be a discretely use. It leads to inflammation and irritation in children. It would lead to contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals,"" Dr Girish said.Iron causes irritationThough the powders are made of rose hips or maples, the tiny pieces of iron cause more irritation. “on scratching, this could leave permanent scars,” Dr Girish said.Meanwhile, having known about the way the itching powder is misused, Shashi Kumar D, general secretary, KAMS said, ""If it is available online, we will approach the government and seek a ban. Although school children might find it tough to purchase the powder without parents' knowledge, college students will be more vulnerable."""	Bengaluru,	 May 25 2019
'Aam aadmi': Now, postman to deliver mangoes	This season, your postman will deliver mangoes at the doorstep!In a first-of-its-kind initiative in the country, the postal department will venture into the business of distributing perishable items. The trial run is all set to take off in Bengaluru. Postmen across the city will deliver farm fresh mangoes to your doorstep.

However, arrangements will be made for delivery within one or two days,” an official communication by the postal department reads.The Mango Development Board has launched a website which hosts the details of farmers and the varieties of mangoes cultivated. It also has details about the location where they are grown. Customers can place their orders online.C G Nagaraju, managing director, Mango Development Board, said that previously the board had orders from 96 customers, most of which have been cleared. “We had challenges finding the postal code and address. Having thought about the possible solutions, we approached the GPO and they consented. We have on board 15 farmers who are certified to have good agricultural practices. This is being done on a trial basis here and will be expanded across the state,” he said. Farmers are expected to deliver mangoes to the warehouse before dawn from where the dispatch will happen. Packaging, ensuring the address is mentioned and the liberty of fixing prices have been given to the farmers.Orders can be placed on karsirimangoes.karnataka.gov.in. A minimum of three kilos must be ordered online.	Mangoes,Postal department,	 May 25 2019

LGBTQIA+ members now more open to dating, love: Survey	Compared to five years ago, there is less stigma attached to the LGBTQIA+ community today, says 70% of community members surveyed by online dating App, Tinder. This fresh insight into how the community feels about love, dating and friendships followed Tinder's foray into multi-gender relationships late last year. Probing deeper, the survey got the community talking about identity, public display of affection (PDA) and more. In an interesting revelation, the survey found that 61% had identified themselves as LGBTQIA+ on an online platform or closed group prior to formally coming out to friends/family.A Tinder statement explained why it surveyed LGBTQIA+ community members: To understand India’s shifting cultural paradigm, their attitude towards dating and dating culture, how dating apps are empowering authentic identities and helping erode stigma.Here's another insight from the survey: LGBTQIA+ are comfortable with PDA on a date when it comes to hugging (60%), holding hands (62%) or kissing (44%). But a high 70% want their date to be involved in issues that the community faces. Increased normalisation of different sexual orientations has made it easier for members of the LGBTQIA+ community to be open and honest about their dating lives (30%). This is particularly true for Tinder users (38% compared to 17% of non-dating app/site users), the survey notes.More than a quarter of LGBTQIA+ people (30%) say the pressure to be in a relationship has lessened in the last five years. One in five say they are less ashamed of their single status than they were five years ago The top three issues amongst LGBTQIA+ community, the survey found, are religious freedom (38%), workplace inequality (32%) and youth homelessness (32%). The research findings were based on a survey conducted across India between March 19 and April 18. As many as 500 respondents were asked general questions to explore their attitudes around their LGBTQ+ identity as it pertains to dating and dating culture. The study targeted consumers between the ages of 18-45 years old who identify as LGBTQ+.	LGBTQ,Tinder,	 May 15 2019

Irom Sharmila has twins on Mother’s Day	Irom Chanu Sharmila, known for her 16-year-long hunger strike in protest of the alleged atrocities of the army in Manipur, demanding to repeal the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958, delivered twin girls on Mother’s Day in Malleswaram, Bengaluru.Doctors said Sharmila’s condition was stable and she was too exhausted to talk to the media. Her husband, Desmond Coutinho, gave this reporter a bear hug and said “he was the happiest man in the world”. Dr Sriparda Vinekar, obstetrician and gynaecologist, in charge of the cesarean, said the procedure went by the book.“The couple has been in Bengaluru since the first month of Sharmila’s pregnancy. So, we were monitoring her progress. She gave birth today at 9.21 am,” the doctor said.The twins, weighing over 2 kg each, are named Nix Shakhi and Autumn Tara. “Both mother and babies are doing fine,” Dr Vinekar confirmed.Sharmila, (47), began her hunger strike back in November 2000, after the fatal shooting of 10 civilians, allegedly by the troops in Malom, Manipur. She had pledged to end her strike only after AFSPA, which gave the army extra-judicial powers, was scrapped.She collapsed six days into her strike on November 11, 2000, and thereafter was fortified with a Ryle’s tube, feeding nutrients directly into her body. In 2014, she weighed 46 kg, nine kg lower than the national average for women.Repeatedly arrested for “attempted suicide”, she continued with resolve.On August 9, 2016, with AFSPA still in force, Sharmila licked a drop of honey off her hand, signalling the end of her protest, pledging to enter politics to continue her fight against the act.Nominated in 2005 for the Peace Nobel, she is often called ‘The Iron Lady of Manipur’ and ‘Mengoubi’, meaning ‘The Fair One’.

Moonwalk with a twist	Twenty-five-year-old Prakash, can give other youngsters like him a run for their money, pulling off the Michael Jackson moonwalk. But what makes Prakash different is that he suffers from cerebral palsy. He is one of the many aspiring differently abled persons in the city, learning to dance thanks to the efforts of a group of volunteers.Differently abled dancers compete and perform in various events alongside the volunteers. The group has volunteers and differently abled dancers who strive to promote inclusive dancing through Attam, an inclusive dance school.“In 2015, Prakash was the only differently abled person in our group. He was incredibly talented and passionate about dancing, evident in his scintillating steps. We knew there were many like Prakash, who might not have a helping hand. It was then that we decided to fill this gap by teaching them dancing,” says Shruti Chinnasamy, dance coordinator and corporate professional.Other differently abled talents in the group include hearing impaired Annie, who performs in various dance events and Saroja, a visually impaired Bharatanayam dancer, whose steps speak her heart. Dinesh, a wheelchair-bound dancer loves Bollywood as his shoulders and arms sway to the tunes.“We train volunteers in teaching dance to the differently abled. There are certain techniques involved in teaching dance to them based on their abilities. Persons with hearing impairment are quick to learn the steps as they can watch and pick up,” notes Shruti.As for the visually impaired, one has to hold them and teach them steps. They may need more time to learn. Those with autism are not comfortable dancing to loud music and hence special care is required.“For those with physical disabilities that restrict movement, we have to teach them dance keeping in mind their abilities. In the case of the wheelchair-bound, we teach them dance involving their shoulders and hands,” says Shruti.The group meets twice a month and also performs in various dance events, corporate gigs and fundraising events.“A special memory close to our heart was when a marathon was kicked off with our differently abled dancers helping runners dance to their steps before the run,” adds Shruti.

Off duty, fitness a mantra for this sub-inspector	Despite his busy routine, Arjun C R, a 35-year-old police sub-inspector, finds time to work out and maintains a six-pack. Arjun is quite the craze in police circles. He even has a fan club of sorts that is inspiring many to squeeze in some fitness time amid tight schedules. DCP (South) K Annamalai and other senior officials have lauded the determination of this PSI posted at the Banashankari police station.“I had never visited a gym in my life until the last six to seven months,” says Arjun. In 2014, Arjun suffered an anterior cruciate ligament tear in the knee, which required surgery. The PSI, then a kabaddi player, was injured during a match. “I was on rest for 4-5 months, unable to bend my knees. I gained a lot of weight,” Arjun recalls.At 90 kg, Arjun wanted to lose weight and be fit. He hit the gym and followed a proper diet, apart from the 12-hour policing duty. “I was active during nights while studying engineering,” remembered Arjun, an engineer who graduated from the Ghousia College of Engineering, Ramanagaram. Arjun leaves home around 7.30 am and reports for duty an hour later. Until 10.30 pm, he is busy at work. After returning home, he works out from 11 pm to 1 am.

In the middle of nowhere, forced out of Uber ride	Questions over safety of travelling in Uber cabs came to the fore once again after a Uber driver left a family in the middle of the road for declining to utilise his service outside the ambit of the app. The cab aggregator is receiving brickbats online for the “callousness”.Rishi Bhatia, travelling with his wife and three-year-old child, booked a cab at 10 pm on Sunday night from Kempegowda International Airport. After starting the journey, the driver told the couple to cancel the trip and ride outside Uber’s network, which will save him the commission paid to Uber, which is 25% of the fare.The couple declined. “Since we were near the airport, we asked him to drop us (at airport) so we can get another cab. But he was not ready to do that either. He switched off the AC, locked the windows and doors. We felt really unsafe,” Neha Sehgal Bhatia, Rishi’s wife, wrote in a Facebook post, which went viral.The couple then called the police (100) and some security guards passing by for help to reach the airport. “(As) the security of the airport intervened, he (driver) just ran away, dropping our luggage in the middle of the road (sic),” she said.In between, they called Uber helpline. The recorded conversation shows that Uber will not offer any help in such circumstances. In the eight-minute conversation, the helpless executive at customer care says he can’t do anything other than advising the passenger to call the police.Repeated incidentsIn December 2018, DH contacted Uber several times over the recent trend of drivers urging customers to cancel the rides and travel off the Uber app. In one incident, a customer travelling to the airport was stranded on road.The cab arrived but the driver insisted that the customer cancel the Uber booking. “The driver offered that I can pay Rs 100 less than the amount shown in the app. But we did not want to take the cab owing to lack of safety,” said Aradhya (name changed).Responding to Neha’s post, Uber released a statement: “We regret the inconvenience caused to the rider. This form of misconduct by a driver partner violates our community guidelines. We are investigating this matter and will take necessary actions, as needed. Safety is paramount to Uber and we are deeply committed to it.”However, Neha noted that Uber never contacted her after the incident to enquire about her safety. Several individuals expressed shock and shared similar experiences online.Commenting on Neha’s status, many shared similar experiences with Uber and urged her to take action. “This is very common with Uber. You may file a case against Uber, since it’s their deficiency in service. They are liable for your safety,” John Deep Pandian wrote on Facebook.	Uber,	 May 02 2019
Techie bribes cop to get lost mobile phone	A software engineer has accused the Bellandur police of demanding a bribe to return her mobile phone that she lost while riding in an Uber cab.Following her complaint, the police had tracked and recovered the phone.Posting her complaint on the Bengaluru City Police Facebook page, Ritu Rawat said she had to negotiate with the police and paid Rs 2,500 to get her mobile phone back.Ritu mentioned in the post that her friend left the phone in the cab. “We were sure that cab driver had taken it, we went to Bellandur police station, we gave the driver’s number and cop called the driver and he was scared and next day, he returned the phone at the station stating that he told police that he found it in the car,” Ritu’s post read. “When we went to collect the phone, the policeman at the station asked half of the phone’s value (as bribe), which is Rs 7,000, for returning the phone.” She threatened to take the matter to the superior officers, but that only prompted the policeman to demand more bribe. “In the end, having no way out, we paid him Rs 2,500 and got the phone,” she said.She tagged City Police Commissioner T Suneel Kumar in the post, who directed senior jurisdictional police officers to look into the matter. Following direction from the senior police, Bellandur police inspector summoned all the staff and recorded their statements.“I have questioned the staff about the incident, but they are saying they’re not aware of it.

An inquiry will be conducted and action will be taken,” he said and suggested that Tobi Ajisegbede of Lagos, Nigeria, who lost his mother, Juliet, at Manipal Hospitals on April 14, should write to the commissioner, asking him to initiate an inquiry.Activists and lawyers pointed out that while the KPME Act can address matters of financial abuse, it offers little in the way of offering succour to victims of negligence.Vijayakumar Seetappa of the medical watchdog, Karnataka Janaarogya Chaluvali, said a few Indian victims of negligence are able to get justice, much less than the thousands of foreign visitors who come for medical care.“There is no mechanism for redressal at all because medical care in India exists in a regulatory vacuum,” Seetappa said.City-based lawyer Taji George, who holds the same view, provided evidence of several cases of negligence by hospitals. “About 10% of all medical failures are a result of negligence and most of the victims are foreigners,” George said. “And, what is the government doing? Nothing.”Though the government mandates treatment rates, George said that a few hospitals display figures right, leading to exorbitant charges for treatment.With increasing cases of negligence, Akhtar said the government will strengthen regulations. “We are planning to appraise and train our people to be more vigilant,” he said. However, the system will only work if the public files complaints with the committee, the principal secretary added. A recap of the caseTobi Ajisegbede from Lagos, Nigeria, who lost his 58-year-old mother at Manipal Hospitals on April 14, alleged medical negligence of the hospital staff, and a pattern of extortion by the administration. For $10,000 (Rs 6,98,000), the hospital offered quick and effective results to Ajisegbede’s mother who was suffering from Lumbar Canal Stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal, compressing the nerves). But what ensued, according to Ajisegbede, was five months of prolonged treatment, which not only cost him and his family over $20,000 (Rs 13,96,000) but also his mother’s lifeOverview of medical tourismBetween 2014 and 2015, there were 4,60,000 foreigners who sought some form of treatment in Indian hospitals — 41,237 of whom had come to India on medical visas. According to figures from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics of India, these tourists added Rs 5,800,000,000 ($86.6 million) to the Indian economy.	surgeries,Medical Negligence,Regulation of hospitals,	 Apr 29 2019
Horns used by garbage compactors a nuisance: residents	The BBMP’s garbage-collecting vehicles may be diligently performing their duties, but their high decibel horns are a bugbear of residents. Residents of Vidyaranyapura, Indiranagar and other East Bengaluru neighbourhoods have complained that the blast of high decibel horns by the garbage vehicles creates a ruckus, especially in the morning hours. “We know the vehicles follow a particular timing (every day) and we keep our bins ready by the time they arrive. But they make this unbearable noise. At least the (horns) must be low decibel,” said Narayanamurthy, a senior citizen residing in Vidyaranyapura.Garbage contractors said the residents do not come out quickly with their bins unless they blast the horns. “Our vehicles in Hagadur have horns with reasonable (decibel) levels. We don’t make noise, but in (some) areas, they blast the horns to alert the residents. We can’t help it,” said a BBMP contractor from Hagadur.BBMP special commissioner Randeep Singh said the compactors, which are secondary waste collectors, are not supposed to use horns, something only auto tippers can.“In areas like Indiranagar, auto tippers (primary waste collectors) use whistles or, sometimes, cycle bells. In some areas, they play music, but low decibel. If we come across garbage compactors using horns, we’ll take action,” Singh said.	BBMP,Garbage collection,	 Apr 28 2019
QR code to check plastic	Manufacturers of biodegradable bags often lie about the microns of plastic in their products. Now, Bengaluru-based Ibhaan Digital Edge Advance Solution Pvt Ltd has come up with a solution to identify such substandard products.The city-based company along with 22 other biodegradable bag manufactures have joined hands and started imprinting QR code (Quick Response) on the bags.The QR code will help the consumers authenticate the bags on sale are indeed biodegradable.“It shows the name of the manufacturer, their details, date of manufacture, microns and durability of the bag,” S Sairam, director, Ibhaan Digital Edge Advance Solution told DH.“As many consumers are contributing to the mess, this move helps them use authentic products that are eco-friendly as proposed by the civic body. This has been supported by the Indian Compostable Polymer Association (ICPA) and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. 22 top biodegradable bag manufacturers are about to get permission from the BBMP,” said Sairam.In 2016, Karnataka government imposed a ban on manufacturing, storing, using and distributing single-use plastics such as carry bags, flex banners, plates, cups, spoons and the like.But the ban has not been completely effective due to many reasons including the fact that policy makers and manufacturers have failed to provide sustainable alternatives and raise community awareness.The BBMP had imposed a ban on the use of plastic below 40 microns in its limits.“This can also be termed as the aadhaar card for the bags as it helps both lawmakers and the common man,” Sairam added.

Security beefed up at city churches for Sunday service	A week after the Easter blasts in Sri Lanka, several churches across Bengaluru have made elaborate security arrangements for Sunday services.With the Home Department in Karnataka sounding high alert across the state, several churches have sent out multiple advisories to devotees and members of the parish regarding masses on Sunday (observed as Divine Mercy Sunday by the Roman Catholic Church).The Bengaluru City Police had issued a security alert in the wake of the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka, and directed religious heads to beef up security and report to police about any suspicious activities on their premises. Following the orders, the churches have streamlined the entry and exit of devotees and general public for masses on Sunday.Separate gatesSt Mark’s Cathedral in the heart of Bengaluru has sent out messages to its congregational members about the security measures. “Three gates have been created for the entry and exit of people. All members have been issued stickers for their vehicles....,” a message said. At some prominent churches, the city police have deployed forces to keep a tab on the movement of public.The churches have appealed to devotees not to bring any metal objects. Frisking will be done if necessary. Cabs and autos have been banned from entering the premises. Backpacks and large bags are also banned inside the churches. A few churches have also formed volunteer groups to keep a vigil during service hours.A Presbyter with a prominent church in CBD area told DH that besides the Divine Mercy Sunday mass, special services and prayers are being organised in memory of those who died in Lanka blasts.A senior police officer attached with the Central Division told DH that they have visited a couple of churches and analysed the security arrangements. “We have directed all churches to install CCTV cameras at all vantage positions. We have tested them for quality of pictures,” he said.As the Sunday service will draw thousands of devotees, police personnel will constantly patrol those areas.The police have also asked community members to employ private security guards for frisking and checking vehicles and baggage. The police have also asked the members to be alert and inform about any suspicious activities to the police control room.	Security beefed up,Sri lanka blasts,Churches,	 Apr 28 2019
Laser therapy for animals offers faster healing	Animals treated at the Government Veterinary College will soon have a better chance at early recovery with the addition of new technology.A laser treatment centre was inaugurated on Saturday as part of the World Veterinary Day celebrations in Bengaluru. World Veterinary Day is observed in the last week of April.Speaking to DH, professor H A Upendra, head, department of medicine, said with the new facility, several animals would benefit from early healing.“Laser therapy is known to help cattle, goats, sheep and dogs. It can treat animals with arthritis, chronic wounds, mastitis, leg injuries, especially in goats. There are several wounds that do not heal. Pets with such injuries will benefit. It is also used for skin treatment,” he said.This would benefit animals with joint pain as well, much effective than conventional methods.The instrument costs about Rs 15 lakh and was donated as part of the CSR initiative by LabIndia Healthcare. “We provided them with infrastructure and they gave us equipment,” Upendra said.It was inaugurated by professor H D Narayana Swamy, vice-chancellor of Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University.The hospital sees about 160-170 cases everyday. According to Upendra, at least 20 of these cases could benefit from the new tech.As part of Veterinary Day, free immunisation is being offered to cats and dogs. On Saturday, about 100 were immunised.He added that there are a few surgeries that would be offered free of cost if the caretakers register in advance.

HC orders deportation of Pak couple	The high court on Friday ordered the immediate deportation of a Pakistani couple convicted for illegally staying in India.It directed the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Foreigners Regional Registration Office to initiate necessary steps to complete the process of deporting Kashif Shamsuddin and Kiran Ghulam Ali before May 5.Hearing the petitions filed by the couple who hail from Chakraphot in Karachi district of Pakistan, Justice Aravind Kumar ordered: “There shall not be any delay in their deportation. The couple must immediately be taken to the Wagah border and deported to Pakistan.”Even though Additional Solicitor General Prabhuling K Navadgi requested the court to grant a few days’ time as they have been waiting for confirmation from the Pakistan High Commission about the couple’s background, the court refused the request.The judge said allowing the couple to stay either in jail or outside would not only be a burden on the state’s exchequer but also amount to putting a premium on their illegal stay.Sources said the couple had been living in Bengaluru at a rented house in Kumaraswamy Layout since 2016, had obtained an Aadhaar card and were working at a local firm. They were identified by the Kumaraswamy Layout and Banashankari police and booked under the IPC as well as the Foreigners Act and the Passports Act.	Karnataka High Court,Deportation,	 Apr 27 2019
‘Avengers: Endgame’ opens to packed theatres	Even before the highly anticipated Avengers: Endgame hit the screens on April 26, it had broken the record for the highest-ever advance ticket sales for a Hollywood film so far on the online portal, BookMyShow.With 18 tickets sold per second, the total recorded sale was a whopping 2.5 million. But thousands struggled to arrange tickets for the weekend or on the release day.Sources said the tickets transferred hands with jacked up prices in black with fans, eager to watch the first day’s show, voicing no protest. Marvel brought their decade-long series to an end with the final sequel, Endgame, and fans were ecstatic about it.So unprecedented are the hype and frenzy around this movie that the law has made an exception and allowed multiplexes to screen it round-the-clock, giving loyal fans a chance to watch the early show.Shaun Joe, a student of Christ University, was eagerly awaited the 6 am first day, first show. “It was one of the best culmination of MCU movies. It was a little difficult to arrange the tickets, but, trust me, it was worth it. It’s amazing how they paved the way for the climax, along with all the logical explanations that were necessary,” he told DH.Exceeded expectationsEnthusiastic fans walking out of movie theatres were in full praise of the fine cinematography and decade-long climax. Their reactions reveal that this movie has surely exceeded every Marvelite’s expectations.“It’s the end of an amazing journey, the ultimatum to all the evil. It, kind of, turned out to be one of the greatest treats to anyone who has been following Marvel throughout,” said Abhishek Chowdhary, a student of CMS.The movie has emerged as a must-watch across the city, with theatres running packed shows.“The movie was a perfect blend, where the characters had reclassified introduction. The fight scenes were jaw-dropping, along with an on-point storyline and cinematography. This is the sole reason why I would recommend more people to watch it,” claimed Shree Krishnadeva, a Marvel fan for over 10 years.	Movie,Bengaluru,	 Apr 26 2019

‘Important to know how to cover news’	While freedom of the press is important, media personnel should follow a set of principles, Sanjoy Hazarika, Director of Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), said.Speaking about ‘Rights of Media: Increasing pressure on free media’ on Thursday, he said four journalists had been killed in the past four years. While some were shot dead, others were kidnapped and killed.Calling the deceased journalists martyrs he said they were exercising their duty under Article 19 that ensures freedom of expression.India ranks 140 of the 180 countries listed in the World Press Freedom Index. The top two countries are Norway and Finland while India is ranked lower than the UAE and Jamaica.Hazarika pointed out that most organisations have human rights policies for salaries and leave. But they should have one for internal governance and women’s security also. Due to the lack of safety in workspaces, there is a drop in the number of working women over the past 10 years.Similarly, there should also be an external policy for coverage. Apart from knowing what to cover and not, it is important to know how to cover an issue, he said adding that the civil society should look at media as its partner in disseminating information and not as its consumer.Instead of covering news, media men are becoming the news. Truth is a powerful tool and media should be clear on it. The media has a duty to reflect facts in all diversity.	Sanjoy Hazarika,	 Apr 26 2019
HC serves notices to state, KSPCB	The high court issued notices to the state, KSPCB, a taxi drivers’ union, Uber India and Ola while hearing a petition challenging the grant of auto permits.Fresh permits would be subject to the result of the writ petition, the court said. The court was hearing a petition by Nithin Puthige, a software professional, who challenged the transport department’s notification enhancing the ceiling of auto permits from 1.25 lakh to 1.5 lakh. Puthige contended that in 2013, the HC, alarmed by the increase in city noise pollution, initiated suo moto proceedings. The court’s direction was not taken to a logical end, he contended.The petitioner sought directions to protect the environment and to fix a ceiling by considering the traffic density of the city.

Undergrad BU students must study environmental science	From the next academic year, 2019-20, the undergraduate students at the Bangalore University (BU) and its affiliated colleges will compulsorily read environmental science, irrespective of their streams.The move from the varsity comes as climate change and other allied environmental challenges loom.Environmental studies will carry 70 marks for theory and 30 marks in internal assessment.“It has been decided to introduce the subject compulsorily across all streams. Graduates should be aware of their role in protecting the environment. A few autonomous colleges have already made environmental studies mandatory. Curriculum for the same has already been designed. We are yet to finalise in which semester the various streams can introduce the subject,” a senior BU official told DH.In order to spur further interest among students, the BU has decided to keep multiple choice questions in English and Kannada for environmental studies. Curriculum would include theory classes and practicals to give students a first-hand experience of the field activities. BU has also decided to lend their campus to other affiliated colleges, deprived of lung spaces.However, the managements of a few degree colleges are crying foul over the move. Requesting anonymity, the principal of a BU affiliated college said having a separate faculty for the subject is not required.“As part of social responsibility, we are conducting various eco-friendly events through NCC and NSS. Also, our students took part in eco-friendly events to mark the Environment Day and Earth Day. So, I don’t think compulsory environmental studies at the college level is justified,” she told DH.

Planetarium decked up for Zero Shadow Day	The Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium is decked up to attract students and astronomy enthusiasts for ‘Zero Shadow Day’ on Wednesday.On this day, the sun will be at the zenith of Bengaluru, as a consequence of which it will cast no shadow.According to officials at the planetarium, at around 12:17 pm, the city will be a no-shadow zone. “This celestial phenomenon can only be observed twice a year. The first time, it can be observed when the sun traces a path towards the northernmost point at the Tropic of Cancer, or what is called the Summer Solstice. On its way towards the northern point, the sun passes directly over the zenith of Bengaluru. The sun then retraces its path towards the south, and the zero shadow phenomenon is yet again observable as the sun’s path passes over Bengaluru for the second time,” said a technical officer.The expert staffers have organised a day-long workshop from 10:30 am to 3:30 pm which can be attended by students of class 8 and above.“We had about 50 students for the workshop and about 400 people who came to the planetarium to observe the Zero Shadow Days last year. We have also done various trial runs to ensure that everything goes smoothly,” said Pramod Galgali, the Director of JN Planetarium.Galgali hopes that more people turn up this year to observe the phenomenon.

Dumped after black magic, injured slender loris rescued	Staffers of the Press Club of Bangalore in Cubbon Park rescued a sub-adult and badly injured slender loris during their morning walk on Sunday. Surrounded by stray dogs and crows, the nocturnal animal was found writhing in pain. The staffers contacted the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the Wildlife Rehabilitation and Rescue Centre in Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP). Rescuers told DH that the animal had severe injuries on all its paws, a clear indication that it was tied up. “This is only done when the animal is used for black magic. It is severely malnourished and has injury marks on its body,” a rescuer said. WRRC volunteer M N Simhadri said people, unfortunately, continue to indulge in black magic using animals even in a cosmopolitan city like Bengaluru. This is the year’s first case of a slender loris being rescued in Cubbon, from where they have virtually disappeared due to habitat changes. The nocturnal animals were once a common feature in the city’s prime lung space where they have not been sighted for the past two years. But the person who threw away the animal at the park was unaware of its disappearance from the green space.Slender lorises are used for black magic due to their big, bright eyes, though their use in black magic rituals is based on myths. In reality, the animals are harmless and shy. They are now found in pockets of the IISc campus, Sankey tank, Lalbagh, GKVK-Hebbal, Bellandur, Turahalli, Bannerghatta and the Bangalore University campus.Forest and BBMP officials have urged the citizens to inform them when they find injured animals in the city.

Not the one to give up, Pudota experimented with conventional recipes and came up with much tastier dishes, which he began sharing on his YouTube channel ‘Millet Mantra’. Now he is a rising star among the city YouTubers. Be it Jowar Methi balls, Foxtail millet coconut rice, Ragi/Finger Millet Vermicelli Upma or Ragi Paneer Paniyaram, Pudota blends the mouthwatering effect of the dishes with the nutritious value to educate his 2,000 YouTube subscribers and 7,000 Facebook followers. The channel is also turning out to be one of the best sources on millet varieties and their health benefits. “I’ve got feedback on how my channel helped people. Some shared their most interesting recipes, while a few reached out to learn more about millets,” the teenager said. His brother Arya’s channel on organic farming was an additional impetus to choose YouTube. “His videos sensitised me to problems of the farmers who see no demand for millets. I encourage people to make millet a part of their diet and create a demand,” Pudota said.“Smaller portions of millet dishes make you full. That’s why they’re great substitutes for rice, which we need to eat more to feel satiated. Millets are also more nutritious,” said the teen. Millets also benefit farmers as they are not water-intensive and are best suited for arid regions.	Recipes,YouTube,Millet,	 Apr 20 2019
Scouts help seniors, differently abled to vote	"Some polling booths in Bengaluru were inaccessible for voters with disability and seniors.Elderly voters were made to walk up 2-3 floors to cast their votes and the ramps set up proved to be inadequate.At the Government Primary School behind Hoskerehalli bus stand, a bunch of scouts carried the wheelchair-bound elders and people with disability to the second-floor polling station. Voters relied on the 10 or 15 scouts since the ramp set up here was uneven.“We’re doing our bit for the nation. We’re still not eligible to vote and the least we could do is to assist the voters. We noticed the plight of the voters last time and decided to help,” Sanjeev, a member of the scout team, told DH.Some voters were furious that the EC did not set up the facilities properly to allow them to reach the booth unaided. Nagaraj Nayak (89) made no secret of his feelings. “Polling booths should be on the ground floor and should be easily accessible. We’re thankful to these kids, but the EC should take notice and correct this next time,” he said. The scene was no different at another booth in Uttarahalli, where the NCC cadets carried the elders and those with disability.The government school in Vasanthpur had the polling station on the first floor, making it difficult for the seniors to reach.Paralysed man carried to polling boothA 52-year-old paralysed man did not allow his challenge to stop him from exercising his democratic right on Thursday.Ajaz Ahmed, who suffers from a host of health issues that includes kidney problems, diabetes and blood pressure was carried to a polling booth to vote by his family members to cast his vote.Speaking about his commitment to vote, Aejaz Baig, Ahmed's brother-in-law says "" He got up early in the morning and was geared up to cast his vote . He kept pushing us to take him to the voting booth. He has never stepped back from voting as he believes that one must vote without fail as a proud citizen of India.""He also adds that Ahmed's failing health has never stopped him from performing his duties and he is an inspiration to his family.On Thursday Ahmed arrived in an auto from which he was carried by four of his family members to a polling booth in Chikkabasavanapura in K R puram constituency to cast his vote. Ahmed is married with two young children."	Senior citizens,Lok Sabha Polls 2019,disabled,polling booth,General Elections 2019,	 Apr 19 2019

Arshad gifted the autorickshaw two months ago.Shanta waited for an opportunity to express her gratitude for what Arshad did and the opportunity presented itself on the morning of the polling day, when she picked him up from his residence and rode him to the United Theological College in Millers Road (Bangalore Central Constituency).“I like him not just because he helped me earn my livelihood, but also because he looks like Rajiv Gandhi,” Shanta said. “I asked one of the media persons to let him know that I’d like him to take a ride in my auto one day. The media person helped me talk to him after which Rizwan spoke to me. I’ve been requesting him for the past three months, but he finally took a ride.”Rizwan, who rode with his wife to the polling station, said Shanta is a good friend. “She has been asking me to hitch a ride for the past three months and I didn’t want to deny her wish,” he said.

Senior citizens turn nostalgic about old times	"When G Nanjappa cast his first vote, he wrote the candidate's number on a paper and dropped it in a box. Today, the 89-year-old's constituency has a VVPAT.DH spoke to senior citizens to draw a comparison between their first election and now.""I have lived here since I was five and have come to the same booth ever since,"" Nanjappa told DH.Now, it is the third generation of voters in his family. ""I have not missed an election. I encourage youngsters to vote. All they need is an identity proof,"" he added.A retired transport inspector, Nanjappa recollects booth 49, where he voted on Thursday, as a place that wasn't easily accessible. ""As I was the inspector, I requested at least one bus,"" he remembered.Over the years, the process has become easier, felt Nanjappa. ""Even candidates are better now,"" he said. Nanjappa's wife who is 83, was accompanied by her grandson.Lakshmamma (67) and her two daughters cast votes at Govindarajnagar in Bengaluru South.""I first voted when Indira Gandhi first came to power. Back then, I was given Rs 300. In fact, we weren't aware who sent the money. Now, the situation is different,"" she recollected. Today, Lakshmamma lives on a meagre Rs 1,000 pension.A few senior citizens believe nothing changed over the years and promises by candidates remain on paper. 76-year-old Lakshmi Bai believes otherwise.Over the years, candidates have turned more responsible and work better, she thinks. Jayakakshmi recalls when campaigns involved megaphones, roadshows and groups knocking on doors seeking votes.Senior citizens believe the focus has now shifted to social media and smartphones. Campaigns on Facebook, WhatsApp and such, overpower real-time campaigning, they say."	General Elections 2019,Senior citizens,Lok Sabha Polls 2019,	 Apr 19 2019
Junk food, not alcohol, causing fatty liver	"Even if you have never touched alcohol, you can still get liver cirrhosis. A new study in the UK has found that a large number of teenagers and young adults have Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver (NAFL). A Bengaluru-based gastroenterologist sees five patients in the 16-20 age group with NAFL in a month, underscoring the prevalence of the condition closer home. ""Eating junk food, cheese, drinking carbonated drinks and not exercising much cause NAFL in the long run,"" said Dr M S Sandeep, a gastroenterologist at Apollo Hospitals. According to him, the profile of people with fatty liver has changed from alcoholics to consumers of processed food in the last five years. The liver bears lots of abuse and allows the patient to lead a normal life until it is 70% damaged.""It takes decades for someone to develop the liver disease,"" Dr Sandeep said. ""When it's diagnosed, a lot of time is lost. Though there are medication and lifestyle changes, you can't actually cure fatty liver."" Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is the result of fat build-up in the liver and is more serious among fatty liver diseases. If you have NASH, you have inflammation and liver cell damage, along with fat in your liver. Surprisingly, women in their late teens and early 20s are developing liver cirrhosis. Autoimmune hepatitis, for instance, is more common among women than men and can begin at a very young age. It may cause abdominal pain, jaundice, fatigue, weight loss and disabling joint pain. If left untreated or undiagnosed, autoimmune hepatitis can develop into cirrhosis."	Junk food,fatty liver,Alcohol,	 Apr 18 2019
Just 20% in state have access to Hemophilia treatment	"Though treatment for haemophilia is free of cost at government hospitals in Karnataka, just 20% of individuals suffering from the condition have access to it. According to Vikash Goel, president, Hemophilia Federation (India), a large population is still undiagnosed, leading to complications and untimely deaths. ""Even the medical fraternity is not aware of haemophilia and its diagnosis, especially in rural areas,"" adds Goel. In Karnataka, the treatment for haemophilia was regularised in 2017. About 2,645 patients are treated free of charge in government hospitals at a cost of Rs 15 crore per year. Dr Swatantra Banakar, deputy director, blood safety, Health and Family Welfare Service, says the number of patients is increasing every year. ""The treatment is for life where blood factors are given in the form of injections. The drugs are mainly imported, procured through tenders,"" he adds. According to Dr Cecil Ross, a haematologist at St John's hospital, early diagnosis and access to treatment are giving children a near normal childhood. ""Proper physiotherapy plays an important part in ensuring that they remain active and healthy. The current standard is to treat all children with regular replacement therapy — prophylactic infusions of clotting factor concentrates to prevent bleeding,"" he says.There is a need to create awareness about haemophilia through education, knowledge sharing and information exchanges, says Dr Anoop P, senior consultant in haematology and pediatric hemato-oncology, Apollo Hospitals. ""If haemophilia is not diagnosed early, the repeated bleeding into joints, bones and muscles may lead to synovitis, arthritis and permanent joint deformities. The bleeding itself can lead to wasting and atrophy of muscles,"" he points out.What is haemophilia?Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder where the person suffers from defective clotting protein and requires external blood factors to avoid bleeding in case of an injury. Based on the clotting factor the disease is categorised into haemophilia A and haemophilia B. Patients with severe haemophilia A constitute nearly 70% of the sufferers. It occurs in one in 5,000 males while haemophilia B is seen in one in 20,000. Though considered an inherited disease, around 30% of patients do not have any history of family members with haemophilia, making it very difficult to identify the condition."	treatment,Hemophilia,	 Apr 17 2019
New authors aim for bestsellers despite 95% rejections	Inspired by the meteoric success of established Indian writers, legions of new authors are trying to make it big in the face of rejection rates of 95% and little monetary gain.Samhita Arni, a New York Times-bestselling author known for adapting Indian epic poems into modern narratives, and who also teaches a creative writing class at a university in the city, revealed that the royalties from her bestselling books can barely cover half of the rental costs on her apartment here. Her rent is Rs 20,000.“We have so many young students in our creative writing programme that I wonder how they will make it in this country where it is difficult to be a full-time writer,” Samhita said, adding that Indian authors have little access to grants and other financial support that authors in the West enjoy.According to data provided by Penguin Books, Random House and Simon & Schuster Publishing, the number of books being published in India is growing at a rate of 15%. Simon & Schuster, which often fields 15 books a month, aspires to sell at least 4,000 copies every month. The average book in India sells only 50 copies.“In India, the minimum sale number required for a book to be classified as a bestseller is 2,000 copies,” said Madhukar Raj, who wrote Hack the Job (2018), a guide which aspires to offer advice on staying relevant in the age of automation.Raj, who said he quit his job as a software engineer to become an author, took almost two years to write the book, during which he expended his life savings within a year and was forced to rely on funding from relatives to continue. “The book was eventually published, but I could not think of becoming a full-time writer in order to support myself because the royalties would never allow me to make a proper living. Now, I am looking to get back into software.” According to figures released by the publishing industry, 82,000 books are released every year in India.	Bengaluru,literature,	 Apr 16 2019

Assamese create a piece of home in city for Bihu	"The city’s Assamese community, including several young IT professionals on Saturday converged at the Freedom International School playground in HSR Layout to celebrate the spring festival of ‘Bohang Bihu’.With the Assam Society of Bangalore (ASOB) rolling out the 20th edition of its spring festival this month, the community marked Bohang Bihu or Rongali Bihu with a dazzling array of dances and cuisine from the ‘Seven Sister’ states of Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim and Assam.Tunes from the traditional folk instruments and a concert by singer-composer Zubeen Garg left many with memories of home.While 30 performers presented the Husori dance on one side, participants of the Bihu kuwori competition busied themselves amid those checking out the traditional mekhela savor and gohona on display at the flea market, even as the aroma of northeastern food wafted in from the 15 eateries that did busy business.Avoiding an arduous journey home for the festival season, nearly 3,000 Assamese from across South India made it to the ground here. “We certainly miss the festival back home,” said Shanthi Tummala who lives in Shivajinagar. “But the celebration here fills our hearts with joy.” Over the past five years of her stay in Bengaluru, Shanthi could go home for the festival only twice. “This is my third new year in the city. I can’t have enough."""	Assam,Bihu,	 Apr 14 2019
A morning feast for astronomy enthusiasts	It was an unusual sight at the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium on T Chowdiah Road early morning Saturday. As Bengalureans were deep asleep, more than 100 astronomy enthusiasts and kids flocked to the planetarium to catch a glimpse of various planets of the solar system.What initially began as a small event at 4.00 am, soon turned into something big, with several people along with their kids descending on the planetarium for the ‘Sky Watch’ programme organised by the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium along with the Association of Bangalore Amateur Astronomers (ABAA). As the event coincided with the summer holidays, kids turned up in big numbers for the event. Speaking to DH, Pramod Galgali, Director of the Planetarium, said, “The event was organised as Mercury, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn are visible in the morning sky. Though it is possible to see these planets during the day, they can be best seen during the morning sky. Hence the event was organised early in the morning from 4.00 am till the sunrise.”The free event was attended by several astronomy enthusiasts and students. Vikas, a student from Vasanth Nagar, said he was “thrilled” to see the planets for the first time.“Even though I had seen them in television documentaries, watching them through the telescope was indeed a different experience. I enjoyed the programme besides getting to know some unknown facts about sky watching,” he said.The different telescopes for public viewing were arranged by the members of the ABAA. The organisers were hopeful that the event will attract more visitors.“A few months ago, we had organised a similar event and it was attended by a huge crowd,” Galgali said.

Don’t buy, just try: Gadgets, toys go rental way	Ever tried aqua aerobics with water dumbbells or toyed around with a cozmo interactive robot? Worn an Oculus VR headset? But why buy such fancy, expensive stuff when you can actually rent them for a day or two, the items of choice home-delivered for a price?This is precisely what a Bengaluru-based startup, Yopik.in, has to offer for experience-hunters, who would rather try than buy.Launched in December 2018, the platform has added over 100 rental items across 11 categories.Most customers rent out stuff just for a day, informs Yopik founder Ojas Parikh. “People want to try out modern equipment, which they would otherwise not buy. For instance, we have this golf-swing analyser that many feel pointless to buy. But they would rent it since everyone is in a rush to experience new things,” Parikh explains.Homemaker Minal Sanghvi had seen her five-year-old son’s fascination for electronic toys. But she knew that fascination was a passing phase, and spending thousands would be a waste.She chose to rent out the Cozmo robot instead. “Imagine his joy when we got home the high-end robot that plays with you, learns from you, reacts and becomes your buddy. No, we didn’t buy this set worth Rs 10,000, but just rented it out for the weekend,” she recalls.Parikh used his Amazon experience to merge e-commerce’s ease of delivery and transaction with the rental services. “Majority of products we offer have been bought by us from across the world, giving us total control over their availability, quality and condition.” To ensure the rented products are returned in good condition, a security deposit is levied. This is refunded once the product is returned and checked.Once a particular product booked online, a confirmation and status of the order is sent to the customer. The platform’s delivery personnel take it to the customer’s home and demonstrates how the product works.Before taking a rental decision, the customer could also check a product demo video and usage manuals online.DH News Service	gadgets,Rental,	 Apr 13 2019
Summer camps get 21st-century makeover	Organisers of summer camps are abandoning traditional activities like cooking and craft, offering in their place app building and entrepreneurship for students eager to learn the 21st century skills.Parents, on the other hand, like to sign their wards up for courses on manners and etiquette, while a few also groom them on how to conduct themselves in public.Many such courses are designed for children aged 5 to 10 and are offered for the first time. Not so surprisingly, parents queue up in large numbers to find a place for their wards.“I was searching for a different summer camp and came across the Android app building,” said Chetan L, father of a nine-year-old boy passionate about technology and aerodynamics.Poorvi M, who signed her daughter up in a course on manners, found the offering “different” from other programmes. “There’s no harm if children learn more,” she added.Ashwin Yadiyala S, Managing Trustee, Sparrows Group of Education, introduced the course on manners and etiquette for the first time. “It’s important that they learn discipline. It’s also important that they recognize and respect other people, something that should be taught at an early age,” he said.Since both their parents are busy working, they spend very little time with their wards, resulting in children learning less manners and etiquette from them. “We teach them how to greet and behave with others in social gathering,” Yadiyala said.Narasimha Naidu, a STEM educator from EduTech Stem Studio, said courses are designed on 21st-century technology skills. Students are trained on engineering and science education platforms.Besides, students between ages 8 and 14 show a greater level of interest in courses on mentorship, budget planning, marketing management, entrepreneurship and partnership firms. Some are fascinated about setting up farm-centric businesses like beekeeping and mushroom farming.	summer,Summer camp,	 Apr 08 2019
Sparrow workshop draws young and old alike	Bengalureans usually spend their Sundays lazing around but some dedicated the day to learning about their friendly neighbour, the house sparrow, and how to bring it back to the city. A group of 100 people, along with children, took part in ‘Bringing Back Sparrows’, a bird’s nest-building workshop organised by Ragi Kana, a hub of cultural activities along Bannerghatta Road in southern Bengaluru.The workshop was facilitated by J N Prasad, a bird watcher from Hakki Goodu. The participants not only learnt the reasons for the dwindling population of sparrows, which were once found in abundance in the city, but also how to create bird’s nests using things commonly found in homes to give sparrows a comfortable, yet safe space, such as shoe boxes and reusable materials. For many, especially children, learning about sparrows and working on creating their nests was an eye-opening experience. Arun Kumar, a volunteer from Ragi Kana, said they had been conducting workshops on different themes every Sunday to bridge the gap between rural producers (farmers) and urban consumers.Weekly marketThe other objective is to create awareness about social and environmental issues. They also set up a weekly market to help people buy groceries, vegetables and handlooms directly from farmers. The workshop on sparrows was the 98th such event organised by Ragi Kana.	sparrows,	 Apr 08 2019
Pvt bus operators make hay while festive sun shines	Fares of most of the private buses shot up on Friday night due to festive rush, as people made all efforts to reach their hometowns. Most of the operators stuck to the 50% hike - the limit set by the State Transport Authority (STA), though some charge more.Last month, the STA called a meeting of private bus operators and warned them against hiking the rates beyond 50% of the normal fares. The instruction was given following complaints by the public that they are forced to pay a bomb during weekend rush and festive season.However, unlike the KSRTC, private buses do not have a base fare. Officials said some private operators were using this loophole in the STA’s argument to charge more than 100%.On the Bengaluru-Hubballi route, the normal fare for non-AC sleeper bus went up from the range of Rs 800-900 to Rs 1,100-1,400. On the Mangaluru route, a leading operator charged Rs 3,000 for a seat, which usually costs less than Rs 1,000.A senior official from the regional transport office (RTO) said they were monitoring the fares for violation of the direction. When asked about the Rs 3000 ticket for Mangaluru, he said RTO inspectors were trying to book the ticket, which will be used as evidence for action against the operators.“We are also trying to book tickets online through app and web interface of some operators and aggregators. Buses charging high fares will be penalised,” the official added.The state government has been sitting on a proposal by the RTO to fix minimum and maximum fare per kilometre for buses running on contract carriage permit (running from point A to B without stops). The existing fare rules apply only for buses running on stage carriage permit (operating like city transport with multiple stops).Last week, Transport Commissioner V P Ikkeri said the subject will be taken up after the elections.

The police also said that the owner of the building had provided shelter to Mallappa’s family.	K R Puram,Drowning,	 Mar 29 2019
NLSIU professor frames draft law on water management	Professors from National Law School India University (NLSIU) have prepared a comprehensive law on water management that proposes to have all departments concerning with water under one umbrella of law, implement and follow it.Agriculture minister N H Shivashankara Reddy in December 2018 had approached Dr M K Ramesh, professor of law, NLSIU, and his team, to prepare a thorough law to include all aspects of water and its protection. Accordingly, the law professor and his team have come up with a draft law.According to Dr Ramesh, till date, no states have come up with any comprehensive law on water except Rajasthan that had a law with some inputs from the law university.“A law on water would bring all the stakeholders, i.e. the departments, under one umbrella of law to follow one set of rules. As far as Bengaluru is concerned, there is already an uneven distribution of water to the city dwellers. Incorporating water law and enforcing it would help everyone to get equal water supply,” he said.Explaining about people-centric initiatives and traditions like Jal Biradari in Rajasthan and Pani Panchayat in Maharashtra, which have demonstrated enduring value of traditional wisdom and communitarian contributions to good water governance, Dr Ramesh said these traditional water conservators should be recognised and accommodated into the system of water governance in the state of their origin.“There are traditional conservators even in Karnataka. It is just a matter of time for the government to identify them and their contribution,” he added.The objective of the law** Legal empowerment of water users by crystallisation of their rights and securing them.** Accommodation and adoption of good traditions and best-practices in water resource management by communities.** Developing linkages and strengthening the bonds of the relation between water users, line agencies, statutory bodies and constitutional institutions and evolving mechanisms for their coordinated and harmonious functioning.** Law for conservation, protection, equitable and efficient use and to safeguard water, food and ecological security and sustainability.** Law to converge, consolidate and harmonise all existing laws and institutions of enforcement.** Guiding principles, the doctrine of public trust, equity, sustainable use and conservation.** Top priority to human and ecological needs.** Community participation, restoration, efficient, equitable, beneficial and optimal use-strategies of governance.

The court was hearing a petition filed by Jitendra Kumar Rajan, a computer science student at Khaja Bandanawaz College of Engineering (KBN), who had moved the court seeking directions to the university to declare his results. A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy disposed of all the applications filed by the student after hearing them.The nightmareJitendra Kumar Rajan, a resident of Karkala, Udupi district, got admitted to KBN College in 2005. His ordeal began in 2008 when he was not issued a hall ticket to take the exams. In 2009, he was forced to take readmission as the university did not announce the result of exams conducted in June 2009. In 2012, his first- and second-semester results were not announced following which he filed his first petition. His ordeal continued with the university not declaring his results but permitting him to appear for the examinations. In his fifth semester, the student had moved the court against the university contending that “the university was not giving the results at the right time”. Speaking to DH, the petitioner said: “The university said they have destroyed my answer books but are not giving a valid reason for the same. I want to know as to why my answer books were destroyed and why my results are being withheld.”	High Court of Karnataka,Visvesvaraya Technological University,	 Mar 28 2019

Range Rover crash: Sagar wasn’t at the wheel, say cops	It wasn’t businessman Sagar Jayram at the wheel of the Range Rover Evoque involved in the ghastly accident, which in fact killed him near Hoskerehalli toll booth on NICE Road on Tuesday. Sagar’s friend and business partner, Gowtham was driving the vehicle on a test drive, the police said on Wednesday.Soon after the accident, as the victims were taken to the BGS Global Hospital, Gowtham allegedly told the police that he wasn’t driving.Demo car driver Shivakumar, in the co-passenger seat next to the driver, after receiving first-aid, headed to the police station and confirmed that it was indeed Gowtham who was driving.Shivakumar has been made the complainant and an eyewitness. Byatarayanapura traffic police have pressed charges against Gowtham for causing accidental death due to rash and negligent driving, not amounting to murder. The police are waiting for Gowtham, (27), a resident of Girinagar, to recover to arrest and question him.“As all victims were in shock soon after the accident, our men initially presumed that it was Sagar who could be driving. It later turned out as Gowtham,” said DCP Soumyalatha S K.Shivakumar told the police that though Sagar was the one interested in buying the car, Gowtham was driving it while Sagar and his wife Sandhya along with their six-year-old son Samarth sat behind. The family members were not wearing seat belts and when the car toppled. Sagar hit himself against the front seat and window panes sustaining injuries to his face and bleeding from his ears, the police said.Gowtham was driving the car in a rash and negligent manner, at least between 150 to 180 kmph, when he lost control. The vehicle hit a toll booth road median, ploughed through the guard rails and an iron fence, toppling into an open ground 10-12 metres beneath. The accident instantly killed Sagar, while his wife Sandhya fractured her spine. Their son Samarth escaped unhurt. Gowtham and Shivakumar survived as they wore seat-belts and their airbags deployed.Meanwhile, the bereaved family members of Sagar Jayram claimed his body from the Victoria Hospital after the postmortem on Wednesday. Sagar’s wife is still in a critical condition.		 Mar 28 2019
12 injured as BMTC bus topples on flyover	A BMTC bus toppled after crashing into the side ramp of the Chord Road flyover at morning rush hour on Wednesday, wounding 12 people but giving a narrow escape to many others. The bus (bearing registration number KA 01/FA 2309) was plying on the route number 180A from Kaval Byrasandra to Karnataka Housing Board in northern Bengaluru. The route belongs to the BMTC’s Sumanahalli depot. As the bus approached the upper ramp of the flyover near Rajajinagar 1st Block around 10.45 am, its front wheels hit the retaining wall on the left side. The bus toppled in no time. The Malleswaram traffic police rushed to the spot and shifted the injured to the nearby Fortis Hospital. The driver, the conductor and four women were among the injured. One woman sustained multiple fractures to her hand and is being treated in the ICU. Others are being treated at the KC General and Fortis hospitals, police said. “We have received and treated 12 patients following the BMTC bus mishap that happened in the morning today. Of them, one has been shifted to ICU for further treatment, one requires surgery, five have already been shifted to the ward and the rest were discharged after giving necessary treatment,” said a spokesperson for Fortis Hospital, Rajajinagar. Traffic divertedTraffic was diverted to two alternative routes. Police used a crane to lift the bus and tow it away to clear the traffic on the flyover. Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) P Harishekaran visited the spot and supervised the towing away of the bus. Soumyalatha S K, DCP (Traffic-West), said there were no children on the bus.

Residents pay a bomb to get rid of monkeys	"The loss of green cover, the mushrooming of apartment complexes and the growing piles of garbage have compounded the monkey menace in the city, especially on the outskirts. Now, it’s a double whammy for citizens. They have to pay a bomb to get rid of the animals. Apartment associations are being asked to pay anything between Rs 65,000 and Rs 1 lakh for the capture and release of monkeys to conducive habitats. “Monkeys raid our place every day. They rummage through garbage buckets, snatch lunch boxes from children and even enter our homes. We approached the Karnataka Forest Department, which routed us to monkey catchers, who in turn demanded Rs 1 lakh. The relief lasted just a week... the monkeys returned,” said Dinesh, a resident of an apartment complex in Vidyaranyapura.Sujatha from Sarjapura Road had a similar experience. “Initially, the rescuer demanded Rs 1 lakh. He claimed to be an expert from Maharashtra. When we tried to buy time, he brought the fee down to Rs 85,000. Monkeys have attacked children and women,” she said.Some apartment complexes are using firecrackers to drive away monkeys. This “special” duty is entrusted with the security guards.Karnataka Forest Department officials said that it was up to the apartment owner and animal rescuer to fix the cost. The department has only given permission to catch monkeys and release them into conducive habitats under Section 11(1-A) of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, said R Gokul, Chief Conservator of Forests, Bengaluru.“People approach us, saying there is a threat to children and that properties are being damaged. Appropriate directions have been issued to the deputy conservator of forests. Unlike rural areas, monkeys face no threat from predators like leopards in the city. Food is also in abundance. They are unable to move around, as there are no vast spaces in the city. Thus, the menace is increasing,” Gokul said.Forest Department and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials cite garbage mismanagement. “Since citizens are not managing their garbage, monkeys and street dogs are thriving,” said a BBMP official.However, urban conservationists are divided on whether to capture the simians or let them be. Fruit trees to feed monkeysThe Forest Department has come up with some novel initiatives to address the monkey menace in urban spaces. It plans to plant as many fruit trees as possible in the forest areas surrounding Bengaluru. The decision has already been implemented at the Jarakbande Kaval forest area near Yelahanka where the department officials have taken up planting of native species, especially fruit-bearing trees, on close to 50 acres. Speaking to DH, a senior official of the Bengaluru Urban forest department said, ""Currently, most of the forest patches around Bengaluru have eucalyptus trees. But ever since the government banned these trees, we have been clearing them in a phased manner as and when the plantation is ready for harvest. Soon after clearing these trees, we are planting native species, including fruit varieties like mango, tamarind, jamun and ficus species, so that they provide food for the monkeys. This has begun at Jarakbande Kaval,"" the official said.It is the lack of food in the forest that has prompted the primates to stray into human habitations, the official observed."

Man killed in high-speed Range Rover test drive	An accident during a high-speed test drive of a Rs 65-lakh Range Rover Evoque claimed the life of a 31-year-old businessman and left his wife with a fractured spine.The deceased, Sagar Jayaram, an interior decorator, was a resident of Girinagar. Sagar’s wife Sandhya (27) sustained a fracture in her spine and is admitted to the BGS Global Hospital off Uttarahalli Main Road near Kengeri.Sagar’s son Samarth (6), and his friend and business partner Gowtham, and the demo driver Shivakumar escaped unhurt in the accident near Hoskerehalli toll booth on NICE Road, in west Bengaluru on Tuesday afternoon.Sagar planned to buy a Range Rover and had booked a trial drive on Tuesday from a Jaguar showroom in Rupena Agrahara on Hosur Road. The five of them, including demo driver Shivakumar, took the NICE Road for the demo and were headed towards their home in Girinagar around 2.35 pm.“It happened in a couple of seconds,” said a toll booth staffer. The car was travelling at a speed of at least 150 to 180 kmph. It looked like the driver lost control and avoided hitting the toll booths, the police said. There were no tyre marks on the road to indicate braking, said a police officer at the spot. The car initially hit one of the extreme left dividers meant to segregate vehicles.It then hit the guard rails, and ploughed through a fence and fell 10 to 12 metres down an embankment. The toll booth staff and other motorists rushed to the victims’ help and tried to extricate them from the car fearing it could catch fire.The police rushed to the spot and shifted the victims to BGS Global Hospital. Prima facie it looks like Sagar was driving the car with the demo driver Shivakumar in the passenger’s seat. The car flipped over several times and Sagar was found bleeding from his face and ears. The driver and the co-passenger were wearing seat belts and the air-bags deployed.Sagar was declared brought dead at the hospital after which his body was shifted to Victoria Hospital for postmortem.Sagar’s sister, who is abroad, is on her way to Bengaluru after she was informed of the accident, the police said. The Byatrayanapura traffic police have registered a case and are investigating.	Bengaluru,Car accident,	 Mar 26 2019
Realtor’s bungalow gutted in fire	A massive fire broke out at a realtor’s house in Mallarabanavadi, rural Nelamangala, on Monday. The blaze gutted the house in its entirety. According to fire department officials, the fire may have started due to a short-circuit or the lamps lit in the puja room. The house belonged to Ramadhamaiah, who is also a local BJP leader. He is the owner of Garudashree Properties.His wife and daughter were present at the time when the fire broke out. Noticing the smoke, they rushed out and called the fire services. The fire started around 3.30 pm and went on until 5.30 pm as the two fire tenders at the Nelamangala fire station had rushed to a ground grass fire at a eucalyptus grove near Begur in Dobbspet.Two fire tenders from the Magadi Road fire station near Sunkadkatte had to be summoned from the city to reach Mallarabanavadi to contain the fire. The firefighters took at least two to three hours to extinguish it. The worth of the damage is yet to be ascertained by the owner. The air-conditioned bungalow had expensive wooden fittings and accessories which were completely burnt.	Fire Accident,	 Mar 26 2019

New Lalbagh shows the way, drop by drop	The whole of Karnataka is reeling under severe shortage of water, with farmers facing a bitter crisis in the wake of groundwater levels fast depleting and reservoirs drying up.But the elite coconut seed farm at Kannamangala in East Bengaluru managed by the Horticulture department — where the government is developing a new Lalbagh — has shown the state what best can be done with the little water it has.Using every drop judiciously, the farm has not only increased its coconut yield from previous years, but is also paving the way for the creation of a verdant lung space in a region where the water table has depleted beyond 1,000 to 1,500 feet. Until last year, the farm in Whitefield limits used to wilt under scorching heat. The yield dropped considerably for 30 years. But the farm has sprung to life with the announcement of creation of a new Lalbagh in the area.Rudresh, the proprietor of Lalbagh, said that judicious management of water sources resulted in a 30% increase in yield. “Besides the shortage of labour, the borewells had also dried up. But our efforts to revive the farm by providing nutrient inputs and judicious management of water sources resulted in a good yield. Each palm is giving us about 80 to 100 coconuts a year,” Rudresh said.The 152-acre coconut farm has about 3,500 palms of different varieties.The officials and labourers recharged the dried up borewells and also switched over to sprinkler system of irrigation. It saved a lot of water, which will be used to raise fresh saplings.“As the new Lalbagh is taking shape, it requires even more water in the days to come. Hence we have linked with surrounding industries and residential layouts to source treated water for the garden maintenance. We have plans of raising mixed cropping, multi-tier cropping, inter-cropping and border cropping plantation with a variety of palms and other flora and thereby creating the largest lung space in the region,” a senior horticulture official revealed.

Activists issue climate SOS to get political attention	The searing heat on Sunday offered an ideal condition for a group of activists gathered before the Town Hall to declare a ‘climate change emergency’.As smoke curled up from the blacktop in the 36 degrees Celsius heat, activists hoped forcing an emergency would stir a public discussion and create a list of action points for the government to address on the issue, which is threatening to cause widespread destruction.“The elections are round the corner and we wanted to do something more than just talking about the issue,” said Dr Sanjeev Kulkarni, one of the organisers of the event.“My suggestion is to gather a larger group, prepare a list of demands, keeping mother earth and climate change in mind and ask the political parties to include them in their manifestos and commit themselves to implement them,” he said. Such efforts by citizen groups may have failed to move the government, but Dr Kulkarni believed that it would be possible to extract a promise from a politician facing an election.Environmental writer Nagesh Hegde said Karnataka’s climate scene is dreadful. He agreed that protecting the environment will not be possible without educating the public, but blamed India’s growing consumerist society for damaging the ecology.“India was the model for sustainability. We had it in us not to waste food or water. But with the advent of the Western culture, we lost our way,” he said, pointing out that the idea of ‘Westernism’ is something prevalent in the country for the past 50 years.Part of Dr Kulkarni’s proposal to the government was to urge the passing of legislation mandating farmers to devote 1/3rd of their land for tree-based agriculture.“This would help regenerate and percolate the topsoil. Trees would offer biomass and fruits to the family,” he added. The activist said this could be one of the issues that the public could discuss.

Glimpse of future: Drone recharge atop streetlights	As part of the ambitious Smart Cities Mission, the researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have designed charging ports for drones atop streetlights.Battery backup is a major challenge that drones are facing at the moment. The technical team working at the Robert Bosch Centre, IISC, has addressed this problem. Now, drones can skip returning to base stations or crash landing once the batteries are drained.The innovation is the brainchild of Dr Ashish V Joglekar, a technical staff at the Robert Bosch Centre. Joglekar, along with the assistance of Vishwas Navada, designed the charging ports, which will be installed on top of streetlight poles.At the recent IISc Open Day, the team demonstrated how the system works. “When the battery is about to be exhausted, drones will search for the nearest charging port installed on streetlight poles. Drones can independently search for the nearest port using GPS and can home in,” Joglekar told DH.This will initially cater to online shopping platforms, planning to deliver merchandise using drones, where battery backup is the prime concern. A drone low on battery will complete charging within an hour.“We are working on reducing the charging time,” said Vishwas Navada adding that the facility will serve many other purposes than just product delivery.”The team is to hold talks with concerned authorities like the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and power generators bodies to bring in norms and specifications for the ports.“We are expecting norms to be passed on the mode of drone landing assistance, types of drones that can have the feature, safety and charging capability,” Joglekar further added.

Deported Kyrgyz woman sneaks in KIA	A 34-year-old woman from Kyrgyzstan, deported from India for violating visa norms, not only was caught working for the same firm here but also managed to obtain an Indian passport.Narina Dokturbekova, was arrested at the Kempegowda International Airport on March 21, while she was about to take a flight to Nepal.Dokturbekova presented her Indian passport at the immigration counter for clearance. When the immigration officials crosschecked her name in their database, they found that she also had a passport of Kyrgyzstan.She was then apprehended and questioned in detail. She had come to the city from Kyrgyzstan on a business visa, and was illegally working at the marketing division of an adhesive manufacturing company.In November 2018, the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) found her visa violations after which she was deported from the city via Delhi to her home country.However, Dokturbekova managed to sneak back into India through the porous borders along Nepal and came to Bengaluru on road, joining the same company for work. She then managed to obtain an Aadhar card and PAN card by which she applied for a passport, which was issued later. She was produced before a court and remanded in judicial custody. The BIAL police have booked Dokturbekova under appropriate sections of Foreigners Act, 1946 and Passport Act, 1967 along with cheating. Further investigations are on to ascertain how she procured other documentation.DH News Service	Kempegowda International Airport,Kyrgyzstan,	 Mar 24 2019
Students, science enthusiasts flock to IISc on Open Day	For children, Saturday did not seem like the leisurely affair as their teachers ushered them into the sprawling Indian Institute of Science (IISc) campus. The institute — the 371-acre lung space where innovation thrives — had thrown its gates open to the public to glimpse the technological wonders brewing in its labs. The much-anticipated Open Day at the IISc brought people from cities from other states a few hours from Bengaluru, apart from bringing thousands of local residents. Besides students, the event also lured science enthusiasts. The exchange of ideas and feedback on the researches are regarded as important by the organisers. The event featured lectures, experiment demos, poster presentations, quiz contests, science competitions and exhibitions in various departments. The ‘Kids Zone’ was the main draw for young students where various science and technology demos were on display. “This was something I had been waiting for after my exams. This event gave me clear ideas of the latest innovations that will help my studies,” said Vaibhav M S, a student at Christ Public School, Mysuru, told DH. One of the visitors, Siddeshwara from Chitradurga, said scheduling it in mid- or last week of April would increase its audience. “The SSLC exams are going on. The second PU students, who could be significantly benefited from this event, are busy preparing for the CET,” he said, adding that a day is insufficient to visit all the departments. The segments that lured more visitors included aerospace engineering, robotic science, brain research, ecological sciences, civil engineering and mechanical engineering. The summer heat had made visitors hop on to the e-rickshaws recently introduced on the campus, while some students used the bicycles.

At IISc’s Open Day, take 'Stoch' of the situation	Visitors to the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) campus on its ‘Open Day’ on March 23 will be welcomed by a dog-like walking robot.The Open Day is when the public can interact with the researchers on the campus, besides watching experiments live between 9 am and 5 pm.The Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered robot on display — developed in-house at the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems and christened “Stoch” — can walk on different terrains.Also vying for the visitor’s attention will be projects on AI, machine learning and live demonstration of drones. Prof Y Narahari, divisional head at IISc’s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, said the robot is just two feet in length.“Stoch has 12 joints (three per leg) to generate motion similar to a quadrupedal animal (a dog or cat),” added Dhaivat Dholakiya from the Institute.The prototype of the self-operational robot which the Institute has developed could also be used as a rover on the moon, Prof Narahari revealed. “We have used Reinforcement Learning and AI-based technique to generate these walking behaviours,” Dholakiya said.“In a nutshell, we’ve tried to make the robot learn the walking behaviour by itself using the algorithm.”The unmanned aerial vehicles show by the department of aerospace engineering is expected to draw more crowds this time as well.IISc said at least 1,000 of its 4,500 students are involved in organising the Open Day. Visitors will be engaged in science lectures, demos and exhibitions.A special children’s zone has been planned at the old aerospace building. Parents and teachers are barred at this area.The IISc, taking cue from the recent fire incident at Aero India, have decided to stay on high alert.They have sought permission from the department of fire and emergency services to station a fire extinguisher on the campus.

No consent for new borewells in core areas of Bengaluru	In an effort to conserve the existing groundwater level, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has decided not to give permission to sink new borewells in the core areas of the city.Following the decision taken in a joint meeting with the members of Karnataka Groundwater Authority on February 27, the board, which is the authority to grant permission for new borewells, has not processed a single application since March 01.According to a BWSSB official, it was decided not to grant permission for new borewells in the core areas where Cauvery water is supplied and that no applications would be processed till the monsoon.However, those areas where there is no supply of Cauvery water, especially in 110 villages located on the outskirts of the city, new applications may be entertained.The official said as people living on the fringes of the city completely depend on borewell for their water needs, new applications will be processed there. But of the hundreds of applications received, hardly three to four are from the 110 village areas, he added.Kemparamaiah, BWSSB engineer-in-chief, said as there is more demand for water during summer, it is quite obvious that more people want to sink new borewells.“We are not completely restricting. However, we also have to check excessive drilling of borewells that leads to exploitation of groundwater,” he added.Kemparamaiah said there should also be some restriction on the extraction of water from borewells also as they are bound to be exploited. There is a need for some metering system to limit drawing of water from certain borewells.According to an official from the Karnataka Groundwater Authority there was no metering system to check the extraction of water from borewell till now. However there are plans to implement the system in the future, he added.Saving groundwaterSince January 2019, 633 applications received to sink new borewells. Only 138 applications have been processed and approved.Most of the applications from the core areas rejected. According to official records, there are about 3.71 borewells in the city.

Lake buffer zone: Builders want green OKs reassessed	"Builders are asking the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) if green clearance issued to them could be revisited after the Supreme Court reversed the NGT buffer zone order. In February, the apex court issued an order reversing the National Green Tribunal's order to maintain a 75-metre buffer zone around lakes, which the Karnataka government had challenged in the court. ""Builders have been enquiring if they can reapply for fresh environmental clearance or if existing clearance could be modified,"" an SEIAA officer said. ""The enquiries are of two categories: the ones that have obtained clearance and the ones applied recently. Around 25 clearances were given in 2017-18, but now around 30 enquiries have come so far."" The officer said builders are now reviewing all their projects, including the ones designated for expansion. This is the first time such reviews are happening. Some builders are also confused about the order. Following the NGT order, the SEIAA asked builders to reassess their applications to comply with the stipulations or face rejection. It issued clearances based on the NGT specifications of leaving a 75-metre buffer zone around lakes and a 50-metre space around rajakaluves (stormwater drains. The authority is yet to issue new clearances for new projects after the Supreme Court order. Vijaykumar Gogi, member secretary, SEIAA, said he was yet to receive any enquiries. He, however, said people could seek modifications on projects that were yet to begin construction, though nothing much could be done once construction had begun. He said the applications will be relooked into by the committee. ""They could come back (for reassessment) if there's a change in the plan that allows for modification,"" Gogi said. He did not see a need for fresh notification, clarification or new order by the Urban Development Department since the NGT order, which superseded it, has been reversed by the Supreme Court."

CIMA revises integrated BCom course syllabus at Christ	"The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) launched its revised syllabus at CHRIST (Deemed to be University) in the city on Tuesday. CIMA, a leading professional body of management accountants, offers a CIMA-integrated BCom professional course with a focus on management accounting. This is the 10th year of the collaboration between CIMA and CHRIST (Deemed to be University). According to CIMA, CHRIST has the highest number of students pursuing a professional course in the world, higher than the number in the London School of Economics as of the previous year. Biju Toms, Head, Department of Professional Studies, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), said the revision of syllabus happens once in every two years and this year's launch was in India. ""They have covered 150 countries to identify the learning gap and formulate a syllabus that includes concepts that make students industry-ready,"" he said.""Last year, 43 students took the course. CIMA benchmarked our syllabus and found a lot of common areas. Students have to clear 17 papers to qualify, which will help them get better jobs. Being upskilled is needed as several jobs would soon be taken away due to automation,"" he added. Dr Noel Tagoe, executive vice president, Academics, CIMA, said the new syllabus was designed in consultation with 5,500 professionals working in 2,000 organisations across the world. He said that with automation putting a need to several jobs students are required to learn new concepts such as Cloud Computing, Data Analytics, Data Visualisation, Block Chain, Internet of Things, 3-D printing, Process Automation and Artificial Intelligence. Speaking about India's economy, Tagoe said political and economic openness is needed in India. Drawing a comparison between India and China, he said: ""China is the second largest economy in the world. They have nearly the same resources as India. It is just a matter of time that they will outdo the world's largest economy,"" he said."	Chartered Institute of Management Accountants,Christ (Deemed to be University),	 Mar 20 2019
'Knives, pins safety tools for blind women'	Facing safety challenges, visually impaired women across the state are forced to carry folding knives and safety pins.A survey on the condition of working women with visual impairment conducted by Karnataka State Government Employee's Association for the Blind also stated that the government has not trained them in navigation and smart mobility technology such as the smartphone app Eye-D, electronic canes, Google Map and other navigational aids.Out of the 87 women affiliated with the association, 4 of them took part in the survey. “We’re going to submit the report (of the survey) to the Administrative Training Institute in Mysuru, which in turn will submit the report to the state Chief Secretary,” the organisation’s president Ramesh said.“The survey’s intended to check what needs to be done in terms of welfare and empowerment of visually impaired women in the state. Through the survey, we’re also asking the state to train them in using the safety and mobility aids,” Ramesh added.The survey found that in the absence of technology training, visually impaired women resort to primitive aids like folding knives, safety pins and even the stylus they use to punch the Braille code for self-defence.While most of them use technology, those unfamiliar with modern aids are willing to get trained at the earliest. “Mobility training is vital for all blind people to navigate freely,” he said.	safety measures,	 Mar 20 2019
Once there was a sparrow	Try as you might, you will be find it hard to come across sparrows in Bengaluru. Once ubiquitous, the little bird is yet to return to the city, thanks to reckless urbanisation.Ornithologists are now calling for sustained efforts to revive the dwindling sparrow population in the city.According to them, just keeping nest boxes and feeders have yielded little results over the years. Since the last five years, on every World Sparrow Day on March 20, ornithologists and conservationists distribute around 100 bamboo-made, nest and feeder boxes free of cost. Each box costs the distributor around Rs 400. But the initiative doesn’t seem to have helped.As a result, sparrows have now become localised to smaller places in the city, such as Yeshwanthpur or KR Market, which is not a good sign.Ornithologists are now requesting the government and builders to change the construction pattern and build more eco-friendly buildings having crevices.They add that city outskirts, where sparrows are found, need careful planning. According to them, the Kempegowda International Airport is a threat for sparrows. Ecologist and ornithologist M B Krishna says there has been little success with the nest boxes. “It is important to understand that it is about just nest boxes but creating an environment for sparrows. Pollution, loss of native trees and lung spaces are also a major concern,” he says.According to him, sparrows need insects, which can be found on native and fruit-bearing tree species, instead of mono-culture and lawns. The idea of BBMP creating smaller parks is good.“To bring them back a lot needs to be done, especially in town planning,” says Krishna.Sudhira H S, Director Gubbi Labs, who did a study on sparrows, says over 40 sparrows were seen near Yeshwanthpur railway station on Tumkur Road.“But after the tree was cut to make way for foot overbridge, they disappeared. A few individual sparrows were seen in Malleswaram 5th Cross, but since last year they are not to be seen. Some can still be seen in Sudhamanagar, Jakkur and Sanjayanagar,” says Sudhira.Mohammed Dilawar, Founder and President of Nature Forever Society, popularly known as ‘Sparrow Man’, advocates planting local tree species apart from keeping nest boxes.“There is also a need for sustained effort. Many pay attention for a month or so and later forget. Government and builders should also be roped in for eco- friendly buildings,” he says.	Bengaluru,sparrows,	 Mar 20 2019

Disaster management, film media among new BU courses	Bangalore University (BU) is all set to offer disaster management, film media and animation graphics courses from the next academic year, 2019-20.The framework for the same is already set, where the film media, animation and graphics courses will be functioning under the electronic media department and the disaster management course under the department of geography.“A team from BU’s geography department had visited flood-hit Kodagu last year, where the design of the course was planned. Though the course was in the pipeline much before that. So, the curriculum has been finalised, where the admission for the same will happen from the next academic year. This would be one of the professional courses in geography,” a senior official from BU told DH.BU will be offering MSc in Disaster Management, MA in Film Studies and MA in Animation and Graphics from next academic year. As the most number of seats remained vacant the previous year, the BU syndicate decided to give importance for professional courses. Since film media and animation and graphics have greater scope, they have finalised the curriculum.“We have the infrastructure to start the above courses. For animation and graphics, all we need is computer systems, which will be set up at a reasonable cost. And for film media, we are planning to tie up with film institutes, which will be more than happy to help us in practicals. A few years down the line, we will be having our own film institute on the campus,” Venugopal K R, vice-chancellor, BU, told DH.Talking about disaster management, Venugopal added: “It’s not necessary to approach disaster management from a negative perspective. It could also be about avoiding the adverse effects of a natural calamity or the management after a disaster. Due to climate change, the world is open to the risk of many natural calamities. The course is designed in such a way that the students will be exposed to all the aspects, like medical emergencies and others.”	Film Making,Bangalore University,disaster management,new courses,	 Mar 19 2019
Bengaluru girl to attend LindauNobel laureates’ meet	City girl Rijutha Jaganathan is all set to meet Nobel laureates from across the globe, where she hopes to gather further insights from the renowned personalities.Rijutha is one among the 580 young scientists from 88 countries, chosen to attend the 69th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in Germany scheduled from June 30 to July 5.Rijutha, 25, is currently doing her PhD at Aarhus University, Denmark. She is also a part of the EU project - Europah, where ongoing research focuses on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.A resident of Koramangala, Rijutha studied at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai before moving to Denmark in 2017 to pursue doctoral studies.Her passion for astronomy was kindled at a young age when she would stay up all night, along with her parents, to watch the occasional meteor shower or the lunar eclipse. She was a regular at the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium.“I combined my passion for astronomy to my work. I am doing research on experimental surface science techniques like Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy to study and understand the catalytic properties of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium,” she told DH from Denmark.In 2012, Rijutha was one among the 30 undergraduates selected from all over India to attend the 6th Asian Science Camp in Israel, where 5-6 Nobel laureates interacted with young scientists over a few days.“It was a turning point in my life. Till then I had believed that only highly intelligent people studying in the best universities in the world can be scientists. Listening to Nobel laureates and their stories made me realise that passion and dedication are all that one needs,” she said.She said the Lindau Meet will be the perfect opportunity to widen her network in the scientific community and get inspired to come up with original research ideas for her career in science.

Govt hospital runs out of medicines for rare diseases	Six-year-old Jaishruthi is waiting to get treatment for a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) at the government-run Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH).However, the hospital has discontinued treating the patients with rare diseases for the past 10 weeks as it has run out of medicine stock. The fresh supply can be purchased only after the government releases grant after which the hospital floats tenders.Pavitra, Jaishruthi’s mother, said they had approached the court to get an order for their daughter to be treated free of cost for LSD at the hospital.“We have been meeting many officials and ministers to get our daughter treated. While this is taking time, my daughter is running out of time,” Pavitra said.Similarly, Revathi (12), who was under medication for Gaucher, also a rare disease, has not been given a dosage of the medication since January.Shivashankar, her father, said he was also struggling to get the medicines. “It has been 45 days since my daughter has received her dose of medicine for gaucher. Although she is attending her school, she is getting tired very quickly which is not a good sign,” said Shivashankar.Meanwhile, Prasanna Kumar Shirol, executive director of Organisation for Rare Diseases in India (ORBI), said as the IGICH does not have a director, procuring medicines is taking time as they have to call fresh tenders.“Treatment for LSD including, gaucher, pompe and mucopolysaccharide (MPS), is very expensive. The amount depends on the weight of the patients. So for 10 kg, the cost of the medicine would go up to Rs 40 lakh per month. The high court has directed the government to treat these patients and the government allocates funds for this purpose,” he added.Dr Naveen Benakappa, the in-charge director and medical superintendent, IGICH, said the government granted Rs 3 crore to get medications for the rare diseases. “We have got the funds three days ago and will shortly procure the medicines directly without floating any tenders,” he added.	government hospital,	 Mar 19 2019

Sunscalded trees to get soothing balm this Holi	Thousands of trees in the city that die or get affected due to sun scalding and insect attacks will get a new life this Holi, as a group of youths has come to their rescue.The Heartfulness Green has launched an initiative ‘PeaceTrees’ in over 40 cities across India, where they will paint the trees with a mixture of herbal extract and natural lime. In Bengaluru, the event is scheduled to be held in Indiranagar on the day of Holi.“This initiative will be carried out to give a special meaning to the festival. Heartfulness, its partner organisations and local communities aim to spread the message of peace by applying this mixture on the trees on the festival of colours,” Sourabh Shinde, the organiser of the campaign told DH“Painting trees with the mixture of lime and herbal extract helps protect them from the scorching summer heat, termites, insects, infections and cracking of the bark. So Holi is not just about playing with colours. We want to make it eco-friendly,” Shinde added. Beside painting trees, the campaign also includes planting endemic tree saplings. The month-long event is scheduled in over 40 cities all over the country.Sourabh said: “The initiative is very economical. To paint 500 trees, it will cost us anywhere between Rs 700 and Rs 1,000. It is the same amount an individual or a group spends to celebrate to get Holi colour. So its not hefty on our pockets.” More than 500 volunteers are said to be taking part in the campaign and the number is expected to cross thousand.	Holi,trees,	 Mar 19 2019
Illegal borewells on Muthanalluru lakebed wind up	The 10-odd illegal borewells that were dug on the Muthanalluru lakebed for commercial purposes have been shut down by the officials.Unauthorised water traders drilled borewells in the buffer zone of the lake. “None of the borewells were authorised by the concerned authorities. Nor they were used for agricultural purposes. The water drawn from the borewells was sold as a commodity,” said Major Santhosh Kumar.“The authorities took action immediately after it was brought to their notice. I had written to the tahsildar and panchayat officials. Finally, the borewells were closed,” he added. Under the Karnataka Groundwater (Regulation and Control of Development and Management) Act, 2011, every borewell in the city should be registered.The notification said violators would be fined Rs 10,000 or sent to three years in prison.	illegal borewells,Muthanalluru lakebed,	 Mar 19 2019
Woman accuses investigating cops of harassment	A woman accused of cheating a US-based software engineer has filed a complaint against the police investigating her. Ramya Nair, employed with a private company, complained to the city police commissioner that the Parappana Agrahara police were harassing her and her father by filing a false cheating complaint.The police registered an FIR against Ramya and her father Kunjiraman T K following a complaint filed by Jothi Krishnan, a US-based software engineer. It was alleged that she had cheated him to the tune of Rs 18 lakh on the pretext of marriage.Instead of investigating the case, the police are making continuous phone calls and forcing her to marry him, she said.Ramya said she came into contact with Krishnan on a matrimonial website in 2013. “I was preparing for my civil service exams. He wanted to marry me, but my family members did not agree.“Later, we continued as friends. I needed money and borrowed it from him, but I returned the entire amount after two years and I have proof of that,” she said.Ramya said Krishnan began pressing her for marriage again, but she did not agree. He then sent her obscene messages, and when she completely ignored him, he filed a false complaint against her.“The police are now threatening to arrest me and tarnish our image. After harassing us for nearly a week, they finally registered an FIR on March 14,” she stated.“We stay in Puttenahalli near JP Nagar, but the complaint has been filed at Parappana Agrahara. The police are supporting Krishnan,” she said.Ramya also said despite filing a complaint against Krishnan with the Puttenahalli police a month ago, no action has been taken.Krishnan, for his part, said in his complaint that he paid Ramya Rs 18 lakh on various occasions since 2013.Though Ramya and her family agreed for the marriage, they vacated the house when he visited them on February 20 to speak about their engagement.	harassment complaint,Bengaluru City Police,Cops,	 Mar 18 2019
Things to do at weekends in Bengaluru	There’s a lot more to Bengaluru than its pubs and breweries. Tourists should not only visit the city’s watering holes but also explore its rich culture. This is the crux of the state government’s latest move to redefine the Brand Bengaluru. Taking the budget announcement forward, the government has directed the Tourism and Kannada and Culture departments to prepare plans on how best the local culture can be showcased. The government wants to expand the Brand Bengaluru beyond the Pub Capital of India element. “This is not what Bengaluru is all about. There is nothing much for people to do during weekends. We do not want to shed the Pub Capital image, but want to add more elements,” government sources said. Cultural showsOne of the ways to make the city more vibrant, said Priyanka Mary Francis, Director, Department of Tourism, is to create museum and music circuits along with weekend cultural shows. The department is drawing a plan by roping in KPMG, the global professional service company, to host night-long mythological and historical theatre plays during weekends. Folk music shows on the lines of rock shows, Yakshagana performances and dramas are also on the cards. Janapada Jatre The chief minister’s budget speech spoke about holding Jatres (fairs) across Karnataka, including in Bengaluru. But the two departments are not keen on holding the Janapada Jatre because of traffic congestion on Bengaluru roads. A traditional Jatre would comprise Goravara Kunitha, Veeragase, Dollu Kunitha, Pata Dance, Thamate and Jaggalige drums. B H Anil Kumar, Additional Chief Secretary, Kannada and Culture Department, said Jatres could potentially block traffic on the city’s roads. That’s why the focus is on other activities that attract the youth. Events with limited reachAccording to Kumar, cultural shows are happening in the city but they are organised by private organisations or individuals, limiting their reach and scope. Besides, they hardly attract youth.	Bengaluru,events,	 Mar 17 2019
Unlucky streak shatters street vendor’s dream	Here’s a story quite resonant with the times we live in — of unemployment and the struggle to make ends meet. Many are losing out like this vegetable vendor, whose dream of upgrading his trade ended on a bad note. Suresh G K, 41, came up in life competing with e-commerce giants, earning Rs 500 a day selling vegetables in his small shop. He rented the shop after being evicted by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) from a footpath he had set up shop in Kamalanagar near Basaveshwara Nagar. Suresh had to take care of his family — a 6-year-old son, an 11-year-old daughter, wife and parents. He convinced his wife that he would do well in the vegetable business if he purchased a goods auto-rickshaw. His wife, over the past four years, had saved up for the children’s school fees. The couple used the money as down payment and bought a brand new goods auto worth Rs 2.20 lakh. The rest of the money came from a loan. The accidentOne day, dreaming of his flourishing business, Suresh was riding his new auto-rickshaw with a temporary registration plate, taking it for alteration work to stack vegetables. But fate had something else in the store. To avoid a bike that was about to collide head-on with his auto and to save a child perched on the petrol tank of that bike, Suresh veered to the side but collided with a stationary Maruti Ritz. Car owner Raghu seized the auto and demanded Rs 15,000 for repairs. Until Suresh brought the money, Raghu would not release the vehicle. Since Raghu did not have space to park the auto, he sent it to his sister’s house in Annapurneshwari Nagar. Suresh scrambled and arranged the money, but sadly his mother was hospitalised. Suresh told Raghu that he could give only Rs 10,000. Raghu agreed and said Suresh could collect the auto the following day.Auto stolenA relieved Suresh was about to leave his house the next day when he received a call from Raghu, asking if he had already taken the auto. Suresh said no. As fate would have it, the auto was stolen. Later, Suresh, along with the car owner, searched for the auto, but in vain. Suresh approached the Basaveshwara Nagar police on March 12 and filed a complaint of theft. He is now back on the footpath selling vegetables.	Street vendor,	 Mar 17 2019
RTO official dining with actor assaulted by her friend	An RTO official was caught in the crossfire when he tried to intervene during a heated argument between Kannada actor Ragini Dwivedi and one of her friends at a star hotel on March 15. He was left with a head injury after the actor’s friend hit him with a beer bottle. Ravishankar, the RTO official, was having dinner with Dwivedi and other friends at the Ritz-Carlton, Residency Road. Shivaprakash, a friend of the actor’s, came up to their table around 11 pm and got into a heated argument with her. When Ravishankar tried to intervene, Shivaprakash grabbed a beer bottle and smashed it on his head, bleeding him in no time. Other members of the group separated them and whisked Ravishankar away from the hotel. Ravishankar later approached the jurisdictional Ashoknagar police and filed a complaint. Police booked Shivaprakash under IPC sections 324 (assault using dangerous weapons), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke the breach of peace).Dwivedi could not be reached for comment as her phone was switched off. On his part, Shivaprakash claimed that he was in Mysuru and that he was being “unnecessarily” dragged into the matter.	Ragini Dwivedi,	 Mar 17 2019
BBMP raids shopping malls	"It has been three years since the government banned the manufacturing and use of plastic, but traders and the public remain obsessed over its use.So, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike decided to launch a crackdown on plastic use, and on Saturday, targeted swanky malls in the city. They found a flagrant violation of the plastic ban by traders, who used plastic materials disregarding rules.As the team of BBMP health officials raided six shopping malls — Orion mall (west zone), Garuda mall (east zone), Forum mall (south zone), Phoenix mall in Mahadevapura, RMZ Galleria in Yelahanka and Meenakshi mall in Bommanahalli — they found a popular supermarket chain and ice cream stores violating the plastic ban.Firms operating in these malls did not segregate dry and wet waste. The shops were collectively fined Rs 13.15 lakh, while officials seized about one tonne of plastic materials (1,010 kilograms), including packing materials and cups.""The civic body received complaints that many malls have failed to comply with the plastic ban,"" BBMP health officer Balasundar A S said.""The malls in the six zones were found using plastic in shops, food courts, supermarkets and upscale showrooms."" The BBMP has also cancelled trade licences of four hotels operating in these malls."	BBMP,	 Mar 17 2019

Life on Bengaluru's Namma Metro	Travelling in private cars or on two-wheelers has become a tiresome task in Bengaluru. And Namma Metro has come as a boon for those, including this author, to escape the drudgery of driving back after a tiring day at work.The Metro is a great way to get around in Bengaluru. But it can be a tough ride at peak hours in jam-packed coaches, with commuters getting squeezed and subjected to a lot of jostling. This is one of the negative sides of a Metro ride. But, it is not all bad news. There is an ample number of people amusing fellow passengers with their antics and thus providing comic relief during a trying journey.Silly antics I have witnessed can be stress busters, but some dangerous things people do make me wonder if they just don’t care about their or fellow passengers’ safety.Wrong platform Deciphering the signage to enter the right platform can be a tough task for those who are not regulars on the Metro. But it does no harm to ask the Metro staff about the right platform. This author saw a recent incident when a young couple barged onto a platform, but saw their train entering the station on the other side. “Oh s@!&” went the gentleman before commencing the long trudge to the right side.Eager for entry Everyone is clearly told to give way to alighting passengers. Along comes a guy who firmly believes he is within his rights to enter before others can exit. Sure, all of us would like to get into the car quickly. But his exuberance in trying to get in surely made other passengers and me wonder what he is going to gain out of doing this. He is clearly inconveniencing others. The bloke fell into line only after getting a mouthful from the security staff.No entry It seems like all common sense can fail at times. Standing in a long queue to enter is boring no doubt. Wondering why the rush on that day, passengers had to sulk and bear it. There was one lady who decided to do something about it – trying to enter through the exit gate. Much to the amusement of the passengers in the queue, she repeatedly tried to swipe the token despite a red ‘X’ on the display indicating no entry. Better sense prevailed after a few failed attempts and passengers in the queue had a bit of entertainment.In your face Travelling during peak hours can be uncomfortable no doubt. But it can get embarrassing too as passengers are stuffed like sardines in a can. I, just like other passengers, find it rather annoying when my face is just a few centimetres away from another person’s. What makes things worse is realising that one can’t even turn away. Even if one manages to wriggle in another direction, there is every chance of another ‘in your face’ encounter.No network Watching videos on YouTube or listening to music is a great way to kill time on the Metro. The odd passenger can get frustrated if the data transfer stops in the underground sections. What is amusing is the fact that the hardcore movie and music lovers don’t want any pause to their ‘entertaining’ journey. Funnily, they don’t give up and try to refresh the page, press play/ pause more than a few times. No avail, theirs is an agonising wait till the train emerges from the underground section.Door confusion Again, occasional Metro travellers have a tough time figuring out which side the doors will open where they need to get off. Which side the doors will open is announced well in advance. There are a few who are in a different world and pay no attention to the announcement. The result is a heroic effort to get through the maze of people. The more aggressive ones manage it. For a few, it is a return journey back to the right station.Use deodorant pleaseNamma Metro cars are air-conditioned and travelling is a ‘cool’ experience. No question about pollution or dust, but one has to put up with another problem – smelly passengers. The last thing one would want is a smelly fellow passenger as a neighbour. If it was the Mumbai trains, the breeze would take away some of the odour. But, in the Metro, one has to just tolerate it. The thought of telling the ‘offending’ person to use deodorant unfortunately can only remain a thought.Escalator charge Not seen Carl Lewis and Marion Jones in action? The Metro could provide you with a glimpse of their extraordinary speed. The announcement says the train is about to pull into the station. That is the trigger for a quick sprint up the escalator to catch the train, but that success is only after pushing and shoving a few people up the escalator.It is understandable that people are in a hurry to get to their destination as quickly as possible. However, it is important to spare a thought for fellow passengers. It might be funny at times, but some of these antics could lead to a serious accident. A dozen alighting passengers could knock a person down because they are in a hurry to get off too before the train leaves.Namma Metro has framed rules for a safe and a comfortable journey.

Big rally against elevated corridor project today	Taking to the streets against the elevated corridor project, various citizens’ groups from different parts of Bengaluru have called for a mega protest rally on Saturday at the Maurya Circle behind the Race Course. More than 50 RWA members will stage a demonstration demanding cancellation of the tenders for the controversial project. The protest will begin at 10 am in front of the Gandhi statue at Maurya Circle.The citizens’ groups that had rallied against the steel flyover project a few years ago, have again come together with a bigger coalition of civic, social and RWAs from different parts of the city.In fact, considering the large turnout, several political parties have expressed their support for Saturday’s demonstration.However, the citizens’ groups have rejected any political support citing that all political parties have collectively contributed to the growing mess. Organisers have clarified that it will be a peaceful demonstration.	elevated corridor project,	 Mar 16 2019
Contaminated groundwater could be destroying kidneys	Next time you drink a glass of water, remember this: The city’s groundwater is filled with deadly chemicals and radioactive metals. When used for drinking water purposes, contaminated water can lead to a host of health problems. One of the toxic substances found in the city’s groundwater is uranium - a radioactive substance that is known to cause kidney damage.A 2015 study by the Department of Physics in Bangalore University - “Radiological and chemical toxicity due to ingestion of uranium through drinking water in the environment of Bangalore, India” - found presence of uranium in borewells in southern Bengaluru.In the study, 61% of 96 borewells contained uranium within the safe limit of 30μgL−1 (micrograms per litre) as set by the World Health Organisation. About 6% of the samples showed values higher than the acceptable level for radiological risk and 39% of the samples showed risk due to chemical toxicity of uranium.Dr N Nagaiah, professor, department of physics, Bangalore University, said that uranium is a naturally occurring radioactive element found in certain groundwater samples. “Whether this concentration of radioactive elements has affected the health of the citizens through kidney damage is something which needs to be studied in the long run,” he added.Dr Manjunath, nephrologist, BR Life SSNMC Hospital, said ingestion of heavy and radioactive metals through water and air can damage kidneys.“One of the major cause of kidney disease in recent days is uranium-contaminated water,”said Manjunath. “This causes chronic interstitial nephritis and leads to kidney disease. Increased exposure to an excess amount of uranium can cause permanent damage to the kidneys. It also increases the risk of hypertension, and anaemia or low blood count. The pollutant in the water gets stored in the body, especially in the bones, kidneys and liver after oral ingestion or inhalation.” Dr Sushma Rani R, senior consultant, Nephrology, Sakra World Hospital, said uranium in groundwater gets accumulated in kidneys and other organs. “It especially affects the tubular functions of the kidney and may cause chronic kidney disease. Problems arise when there is chronic ingestion of uranium in drinking water. Uranium is more harmful due to its toxic nature rather than its radioactivity and it has been identified as a kidney toxin by World Health Organization (WHO),” she said.

Garbage piling up on Whitefield's Nallurahalli Main Rd	Garbage is piling up along the Nallurahalli Main Road near Whitefield. The residents are blaming the BBMP for irregular garbage collection.Residents say the black spot appeared last week. “There was never such a pile up, except for some plastic. Now it is piling up over the past few days, the place stinks. We requested the health inspector to take action after which the garbage was cleared. But today, the garbage pile has appeared again,” said Sharma Desi, a resident.“We have raised complaints with the BBMP via Sahaya app. Hope it gets cleared up soon,” Desi added. Another resident, Hemamalini said: “The BBMP doesn’t pick up the garbage regularly from the area and obviously, this will force residents to throw garbage on the roads.”	Bengaluru,Garbage crisis,BBMP,	 Mar 15 2019

Dehydrated birds, animals suffering this summer	Erratic weather pattern is threatening the life of birds and animals in the city. With temperatures soaring, the mortality rate of city fauna is set to surge.Activists and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) are now conducting awareness campaigns to keep water bowls in the open for birds and animals.Recently, K Mohan, member of the BBMP animal rescue team (forest cell) saved five different varieties of birds, found lying unconscious due to dehydration from heat stroke in the city.The maximum temperature in the city touched 37 degrees Celsius last week, severely affecting birds and animals in the predominantly concrete landscape.Various Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) along with the civic body have rescued more than 300 birds from the start of February.“The animals are dying due to dehydration. More than 300 birds and animals have been rescued till now,” Mohan told DH.“Birds such as black kites, owls, sparrows, pigeons, crows and animals like dogs, cats, cows, squirrels and monkeys are suffering. Most of the calls we receive are to rescue these animals and birds,” he added.Rescue teams rush to the spot and immediately shift the bird or animal to the nearest veterinary clinic or hospital and inject a dose of glucose. They will be kept in the rehabilitation centre till they recover and will be released later.“The volunteers from NGOs and the BBMP are now advising the residents on how to protect animals from heat strokes. Placing water bowls in backyards and terraces is the first step,” explained Mohan.Sanjeev Pednekar, the founder of ‘Prani, the pet sanctuary’, near Somanahalli off Kanakpura road, blames the lack of green cover and seasonal changes in environment.Both citizens and authorities have to play a role to save the fauna during summer. The citizens should place water bowls and provide facilities like birdbaths in the garden, he added.Pednekar also stressed the need for more veterinary hospitals and doctors in the city.“The BBMP should make it mandatory for future developmental projects and high-rises to incorporate architectural elements like birdbaths,” he said.	weather,Bengaluru,Heat,	 Mar 13 2019
City inventor shows ‘Make in India’ solution for piles	A city-based inventor and a government health official unveiled a new device to address the sticky problem of piles, which they said contributes to a 40% decline in workforce efficiency.Speaking to DH on Tuesday, Dr Rajah Vijay Kumar, described piles or hemorrhoids, as not only being one of the oldest known ailments known to humans but also the most secretive. “Husbands don’t tell wives, wives don’t tell husbands,” he said.In an effort to keep the condition secret, sufferers spurn their doctors and instead turn to unlicensed medical practitioners for ointments, creams and suppositories, added Dr T S Prabhakar of the Karnataka Department of Health and Family Welfare.“This new device is a way to fight back against quacks,” Dr Prabhakar said adding that the government had registered several deaths due to treatments recommended by unlicensed practitioners. Dr Prabhakar could not be reached later for clarification.The device, which is priced at roughly Rs 6,900 per unit, involves cooling its inner nano-material to a temperature of -18 degrees C, using a common freezer. Once cooled, the device is applied to the affected area where the nano material gradually releases cold temperatures over a 10-minute period.Dr Kumar insisted the procedure could be be done in the privacy of one’s home and was relatively non-invasive. “There is no cold shock or frostbite,” he said. “I am proud to say that I was patient number one.”When queried about the cost of the product which might deter some Indians, Samson John, director of a renewable energy company which has partnered with Dr Kumar, insisted that it is the cheapest solution to treating piles in the market. “Ointments are a temporary measure and surgeries are expensive and time-consuming,” he said. “Of the 1,291 people who used the device in clinical trials, 88.7% said they had been cured.”As per figures released by WHO and the Rajiv Gandhi Institute, roughly 41 million people in India suffer from piles. Furthermore, 1.2 million new cases are diagnosed every year, said Dr Kumar. Nearly 40% of these are pregnant women while 60% are people living in South India. The harmful effects of the condition is said to cause job absenteeism and a 30 to 40% drop in efficiency across the job market.	Bengaluru,Make in India,Piles,	 Mar 13 2019
 1 lakh saplings for more green cover in all 198 wards	At a time when the city’s green cover is declining rapidly, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is to take up a massive planting drive in all the 198 wards. Around 1 lakh saplings will be planted across eight zones of the BBMP with the support of volunteers from various non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The BBMP has earmarked Rs 5 crore in the recent budget for the initiative. “To improve the city’s green cover and beautification, we have already finalised tender for 75,000 saplings. The saplings are ready in our four nurseries and will be planted soon,” M K Cholarajappa, deputy conservator of forests (DCF), BBMP, told DH. The civic body has already distributed around 6 lakh saplings through the BBMP Green app, launched to give away saplings to residents. “The Palike is distributing free saplings through the mobile app. Citizens can go to BBMP-managed parks and collect the saplings. The saplings can be planted in residential compounds or along the side of the road,” added Cholarajappa. The saplings include mostly indigenous varieties -- among them are trees valued for timber, honge and mahogany.Flowering tree saplings that will be made available are hole dasavala, huvarasi, sampige, basavana pada, tabebuia, jacaranda and tabebuia guayacan. Fruit-bearing trees kadu badami, jamun, gooseberry, cherry and medicinal trees like neem, simarouba and tapasi also figure in the list.“The saplings will be planted in areas that require green cover, BBMP lands and protected lands across the city. The BBMP alone cannot be responsible for the watering, and tending to all the saplings. Hence, partnering with NGOs and people are important,” the DCF explained.	BBMP,Tree plantation,	 Mar 12 2019
Amid water crisis, citizens get half-bucket challenge	The largest body of apartments in Bengaluru is running a social media campaign, urging its members to bath in half a bucket of water so as to reduce the pressure on the city’s depleting water resources. The BAFHalfBucketChallenge thrown by the Bangalore Apartments’ Federation highlights growing concerns over water scarcity in the city as the summer sets in. One of the social media messages reads ‘Looming water crisis in Bengaluru! I took bath with half a bucket of water! Can you?’ The BAF has about 400 apartment complexes as members, representing over 70,000 flats and two lakh people. The federation believes Bengaluru is in the throes of a water crisis with groundwater running dry in many places and the supply of Cauvery water becoming erratic.While the government and civic agencies are working towards reviving the lakes and improving the water supply, citizens can do their bit by reducing water consumption through simple measures. Srikanth Narasimhan, the general secretary of the BAF and a resident of Brigade Paramount, Old Madras Road, said that all these years, their apartment managed with borewell water, but this year they were compelled to buy water from private tankers. “I have been bathing with half a bucket of water for quite some time and it’s pretty easy. It just takes a little bit of a mindset change and a focus on water conservation,” he added. Ajay Mehrotra, joint secretary, BAF, said their aim was to make the campaign viral where people could post simple messages on Facebook or Twitter, saying they had done it successfully and tagging at least three friends, throwing them the same challenge. K V Prasanna, vice president, BAF, said people must take the challenge a notch higher and see how they could reduce the overall consumption of water by half.“This is very important as the city’s water resources are going to be continuously under strain as the population keeps increasing,” he added.	water shortage,Bengaluru,	 Mar 12 2019
Farmers to protest today over PRR delay	Over 3,000 farmers will gather at the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) head office on Tuesday in protest against the government over the delay in the Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) project.The farmers, who have lost land to the ambitious project, said they are not against the PRR. Instead, they want the project to start so that they can get proper compensation and move on with their lives.Raghu, a farmer participating in the protest, said: “We were given notice for land acquisition in 2005. But to this day, nothing has happened. We can use the soil for cultivation, but cannot dig borewells. We cannot mortgage the property for a loan or seek help from financiers as our land has been marked for the project.”Most of them have to get their daughters married, support the education of their children or meet the medical expenses of ailing family members.“In the last 10 years, the government has only conducted meetings. In the last two years, the BDA has not even called for any meeting. Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, who claims to be a pro-farmer CM, has also done nothing. In the name of loan waiver, he has neglected us, as our land is listed to be acquired for development,” said another farmer.Due to the uncalled-for delay, farmers have now agreed to part with their land for cash compensation as decided under the land acquisition bill of 2012. They are not interested in the 40:60 land-sharing scheme.“We have seen what happened in the case of Arkavathy Layout. Those who lost land are still suffering. If the land costs around Rs 10 crore, we demand that the government give us Rs 5 crore immediately and put the remaining in banks, so that we can at least earn interest from it,” Raghu said.Many farmers said they are now making a living by selling vegetables and doing odd jobs in the city, as part of their land is infertile and they have no money for labour.The BDA is said to acquire 1,800 acres of land from around 4,000 people.	farmer protest,Bangalore Development Authority,Bengaluru,	 Mar 12 2019
BBMP may hire different vendor for eggs in midday meals	Though dependent on the Akshaya Patra to run its midday meal programme, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is considering asking another private player to supply eggs as a supplement.The chairman of the Palike’s education committee Imran Pasha told DH that adding eggs in the midday meals will meet the nutritional needs of students in BBMP schools and colleges. “The eggs would be provided by another vendor, while the Akshaya Patra foundation would continue to supply the meals,” he said.He said the BBMP has allotted Rs 1 crore for the meals, while funds specifically for the eggs would be set aside after preparing a proposal.The mid-day meals are provided by the Akshaya Patra Foundation to more than 17,000 students in 138 BBMP schools, 14 PU colleges and four Undergraduate colleges in Bengaluru.An Akshaya Patra foundation spokesperson said the organisation would not object to the BBMP procuring eggs from a different vendor and supplying it to the schools.“The Akshaya Patra midday meals programme for schools follows the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) principle of vegetarianism in its cooking. It strictly avoids meat, fish, and eggs,” the spokesperson said.“If the BBMP wants to provide eggs, we will not supply them to the school directly. The school management or concerned authority can procure eggs by other means and provide them to school,” the spokesperson added. Pasha said the eggs will be supplied by a separate vendor.In December, the inclusion of onions and garlic in the Akshaya Patra midday meal programme kicked up controversy even as several NGOs demanded eggs to be added as a supplement.Organisations and a few experts wrote to the Women and Child Development ministry saying including eggs would greatly enhance the nutritional value of the meals supplied to children.

Bengalureans lament destruction of green cover	"In the season of blooming, when everybody is sharing photographs of flowering trees in their neighbourhood on social media, there is a large section of people who are concerned about how new projects like the elevated corridor will contribute to the destruction of the remaining green cover of the city.""Through the generations, people have been contributed to maintaining the green cover of the city. Now destroying the trees for projects such as elevated corridor is really depressing,"" says Srinivas Alavilli, member of Citizens for Bengaluru. ""At least with the Metro, thousands of commuters were helped even though trees were felled. But the elevated corridor can only accommodate cars,"" he says.A few nature lovers, who shared the photographs of the season’s blooms on their Facebook walls, felt that ""It is important to contain the city's development and spread out more evenly without losing out its greenery"".""As we see people sharing pictures of trees and flowers they have clicked with love and affection, it is so ironic that we also get to see trees in public spaces being cut down,"" adds Srinivas.""It is our responsibility to protect the green cover. If not, what will we leave for our future generations,"" he asks.With the spring coming early this year the flowering trees in Bengaluru are in full bloom.Now it is the time for the 'Silver Trumpet' tree!In Bengaluru, there are many Silver Trumpet trees, which are mostly found in old Bengaluru areas like Jayanagar, Rajajinagar, Basavanagudi etc.A native of South America 'Tabebuia Argentea' (yellow flowers) is commonly known as the Silver Trumpet tree. The fluorescent yellow flowers are trumpet-shaped with some species having double-layered petals.""The flowering season starts from February and will be on till April. These trees will be in a vegetative for almost 11 years,"" says M Jagadeesh, Joint Director of the Lalbagh Botanical Garden’s Horticulture Department.A Silver Trumpet, planted in Lalbagh Botanical Garden by former prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru during his visit to the city, is in full bloom and it is thanks to the efforts of the Horticulture Department.“With the help of tree surgeries and regular pruning, we are able to keep the plant growth in check and maintain the shape. Also, with the help of a good canopy balance these trees can survive for 50-60 years,” Jagadeesh adds.The tree provides good shade and attracts everyone with its bright yellow blooms. It is surely an attention-getter. Vijay Nishanth, environmentalist and 'tree doctor', shared the pictures of the 'Silver Trumpet' tree on his Facebook wall saying ""Bengaluru streets holds this beautyeverywheree in summer.[sic]"" Nature lovers hope to see the 'Silver Trumpet' in full bloom the next spring too!"	elevated corridor,Bengaluru,Nature,	 Mar 10 2019
26 Whitefield policeman win awards for crime detection	The Whitefield division police have awarded 26 police personnel with Rs 10,000 in cash and four days’ holiday for the best crime detection.Abdul Ahad, DCP Whitefield, said those awarded included police constables and sub-inspectors who used exemplary skills and interest in detecting criminal cases. The photographs of award-winning policemen will be displayed at their respective police stations to encourage other policemen.In a major property recovery parade, the Whitefield division police detected numerous cases of housebreak thefts, robberies, bike thefts, drug peddling and cattle theft cases reported from December last year till March this year. The police recovered gold valuables which would be returned to the owners after court procedures, he added.Among the interesting cases was one where the K R Puram police took a 40-year-old Bangladeshi national into custody from the central jail and recovered gold valuables worth Rs 6 lakh from him. The accused Aslam had committed as many as six robberies in Whitefield division and was later arrested by the Delhi police for a similar crime. The KR Puram police, based on a tip-off from Delhi police, obtained his body warrant and got his custody.The KR Puram police also arrested a gang of seven involved in robbery cases. They recovered gold valuables and three mobile phones worth 1.8 lakh from them. The accused, Vishwanath (23), Kitty (31) and Prakash (30), along with others, would move around in an autorickshaw targeting IT employees returning home late in the night and rob them.The HAL police arrested a truck driver and his associate from Tamil Nadu and recovered red sanders worth Rs 30 lakh from them.

Pvt-aided school teachers to lose pay over poor results	In a move that will come as a shock for teachers in private-aided schools, the state government has decided to hold them responsible for poor student performance. As per the new rules, the Department of Education can hold teachers’ promotion and salaries besides annulling the grant-in-aid if a newly recruited teacher fails to ensure more than 60% result. Permitting management of the schools to fill vacant posts, the government has cautioned that if freshly recruited teachers fail to ensure good results in their respective subjects, not only their salaries and promotions will be withheld but their grant-in-aid will also be annulled if they continue with their dismal performance for three consecutive years. In the corresponding five years, if 50% of students in aided schools do not pass, grants to these schools would be withheld. According to the order, teachers have to ensure 60% results, failing which that year’s salary would be withheld. The Deputy Directors of Public Instruction have been asked to submit a detailed report on teachers and their performance every year. According to the state government, until 2015, the government had permitted to fill as many as 3,633 vacant teachers’ posts in private-aided schools. However, going by the government’s diktat - that only schools with more than 60 per cent result or on par with the average result of the district be allowed to fill the posts - aided private schools were able to fill only 781 seats. In fact, this condition had triggered an intense debate in the Legislative Council and the government was under due pressure to relax the rules. But according to teachers’ representatives, the latest results have turned out to be even more stringent.Commenting on the move, BJP MLC Arun Shahpur said, “This will create job insecurity among teachers. The government has relaxed one norm and added another five. This is nothing but slow poison for aided schools.” Niranjanaradhya V P, Fellow, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), termed this as the last resort for the government. “They cannot have a discriminatory attitude. There are several private and government schools as well who are not up to the mark. Before you punish anyone for performance, it is your responsibility to create an enabling environment for them to perform,” he said. Terming employment is a matter of social security, he said, “You cannot just hire and fire. Relaxations of the previous norms are bad. The onus is on the institution and management to perform. It is wrong to punish individuals.”	Education,	 Mar 10 2019
BDA hands over 240 flats to Canara Bank	The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) on Friday made its first bulk allotment of flats to Canara Bank.After nearly six months of talks and negotiations, 240 flats in Phase 6 of Valagerahalli were allotted to the bank employees. Bank managers handed over a cheque of Rs 101.45 crore to BDA Commissioner Rakesh Singh.“This is the first bulk allotment done by the BDA. With this, there is hope that more such sales will happen,” said Vinay G Sugur, engineer officer, BDA.“The BDA is in talks with many other companies and banks, but things are yet to materialise,” said a BDA official. “Discussions were going on for very long because of the pricing with Canara Bank. But the BDA has handed over the flats at the cost of Rs 42 lakh each. This, however, does not include the registration charges and possession of the flats will be given by the end of March, once money is deposited to BDA account and after all procedures are completed.” All flats under Phase-6 of Volegerahalli come in two bedroom-hall-kitchen configuration. The BDA constructed three blocks, with each comprising 120 flats. Canara Bank has occupied two blocks, and in the third block 30 flats have been sold to individuals.Flats in Volegerahalli are most sought-after. The BDA has created six phases and all of them have been sold out. Under Phase-5, 415 three BHK flats were constructed and all sold out only recently.

Bengaluru is most forgetful: Uber lost and found index	"For the third time in a row, Bengaluru is the most forgetful city in the country. This year, Bengaluru is followed by New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata, as per the Uber Index. A study by cab-aggregator Uber revealed riders have forgotten live fish, milk sachets, prams, ukulele, bunch of banana, aluminium storage shelf, yoga mat, knee pad, and even sarees, in 2018.""Over the last year, we've seen objects including phones, cameras and bags top the list of items left in Ubers across India, followed by utility items like wallets, keys, clothing, and umbrellas rounding off the top ten,"" it said.Besides leaving 'the usuals' like bags and phones, other items like knee pads, gold chains, baby prams, ukuleles, and live fish as well, it added.Other items include personal hotspot devices, toy cars, footwear (Crocs), while the other common items that people frequently leave behind include glasses, water bottle and phone charger.Afternoon siestas seem to be the most at fault leading to forgetfulness, with the data revealing most such instances happen between 1-3 PM, while weekends emerged as the most common days.In 2018, the most forgetful days were September 1, followed by June 9, September 2, July 15 and September 8.The company, which operates in 15 cities and counts on India as one of the biggest markets globally, however, did not reveal the quantum of instances of forgetfulness.Riders can trace their misplaced objects by selecting that trip and the 'I lost an item' option in the app, it said."

Alert at airports leads to long queues at KIA	Just recovering from the fog and Aero India-related flight disruptions, the Kempegowda International Airport is witnessing long queues yet again, but for a different reason: elaborate security checks triggered by a high alert following the Indo-Pak aerial showdown.The queues at the country’s third busiest airport are widespread, with passengers forced to stand for long hours at the baggage and security screening gates. Stressed over this, many travellers are taking to social media to vent their frustration.Ananth Sampath, a passenger, observed that he had to take off his shoe and belt at the security check. “I have not seen this in India before. Guess they need to buffer additional time at the airports. One hour is not enough,” he tweeted.The stress levels have gone up not only for passengers, but for the airlines and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) as well. “Tickets, too, have become more expensive due to cancelled flights,” noted another passenger, Mathew Thomas.The airport operator, Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) had this to say: “Access control at all gates of the airport have been tightened and the screening intensified. There were slight delays due to intense passenger screening, but all within acceptable limits.” On Saturday, the Centre had directed all airports and airlines in the country to enhance the existing security measures. Issuing the alert, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) had marked it to senior police officials of all states, in-charges of security at all airlines and airports and CISF officers.The alert applied to all civil aviation installations such as airports, airstrips, airfields, air force stations, helipads, flying schools and aviation training institutes. Twenty specific enhanced security measures were cited to be in operation until further orders.Enhanced screening of passengers meant a 100% full pat-down search at pre-embarkation security checkpoints.The BCAS directive also required enhanced random screening of the airport staff and visitors at the main entrance to the terminal building.Even before the alert, long security queues have been an issue at KIA. BIAL had introduced the Automatic Tray Retrieval System (ATRS) to speed up the screening process.	Kempegowda International Airport,alert,	 Mar 07 2019
Ride-sharing only way out of chaos: Drivers’ union	The government should make it mandatory for IT companies to hire buses for employees’ transportation, which will boost ridesharing and ease traffic congestion in Whitefield and Electronic City, taxi drivers have said.The Indian Vehicle Drivers’ Union has appealed to Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy to address the issue.“There are 6,500 IT-BT and IT-enabled companies in Bengaluru. Approximately 15 lakh people are employed in these companies,” said Gandasi Sadananda Swamy, president of the union. “While they are contributing to the economy, the city’s limited infrastructure is leading to traffic problems due to abnormal growth in number of vehicles. Ride-sharing is the only solution for the problem.” The union also said that several IT companies had stopped “day trips” and instead were giving travel allowance to their employees. “Companies are giving Rs 5,000 transport charges (allowance) to employees, which is encouraging them to use own vehicles. Instead, they should embrace cost-effective solutions like hiring buses for a particular number of trips,” he said.The drivers’ union said that congestion was directly affecting their revenue because of delayed trips, while the increasing amount of time spent on the road was affecting their health. The union has suggested that the government make it compulsory for companies to hire BMTC buses.M R Kori, president of Whitefield Area Commerce and Industries Association, said the government should encourage IT firms to hire buses. “They should start by encouraging them and then make it compulsory. Ride-sharing is the best solution within the limited infrastructure,” he said.“Though many know the problems, they may not be aware of the solutions. We will conduct a meeting with members of our group and start a discussion in this regard,” he said.	Public Transport,IT companies,ride-sharing,	 Mar 07 2019

Bringing world’s folktales to city kids	Tikki Tikki Tembo might sound like the rhythmic beat of a reggae number, but it is actually a popular Chinese folktale.As Shylaja Sampath narrates the tale animatedly at a Banashankari park, children seated around her watch with wide-eyed wonderment and a slight smile.Tikki Tikki Tembo, which tells why the Chinese names are short today, is among the most popular tales of the storyteller.“Storytelling is one art that is rapidly gaining popularity in the city,” Shylaja says, talking about her initiative ‘Stories in the Park’ through which she tells popular folktales across the globe with the flourish of a performance artist.Each month, she conducts the storytelling session at the Banashankari park that has brought children and adults alike. Shylaja brings stories to life by blending narration with performance. She has been a storyteller and a theatre person for the past 20 years, and so the skill is almost second nature.At the end of each story, she teaches children folksongs related to the origin of the story she narrated. The wide array of stories from Japan to Bengal is a treat to both their eyes and ears.“The best thing is, everyone has their own takeaway from these stories; their own perception about them. This’s beautiful,” she says.Storytelling is not restricted to children. Shylaja holds sessions for the adults that draw their subjects from short stories of famous authors like Rabindranath Tagore.“Children may find it harder to interpret those stories,” she says. “For children, it’s always the folktales from India and other countries, besides stories from children’s authors.”Shylaja is also the founder of Ninety Bold Tales, a performance art-based collective. She brings parents and children together with interactive methods, encouraging them to learn through storytelling.	Folklore,Storytellers,	 Mar 06 2019
Lalbagh vehicle ban hits project roadblock	Change of guard at the Horticulture directorate in Lalbagh has put the department’s ambitious plan to make the sprawling botanical gardens a ‘Walkers’ Paradise’ on the back-burner.The horticulture department had planned to enforce a complete ban on the movement of vehicles, including vehicles belonging to the horticulture department, inside the gardens. However, the project, despite support from the horticulture minister, has still remained on paper.A complete ban on movement of vehicles inside the park was one of the demands put forward by walkers and joggers during ‘Janaspandana’— a citizen interaction programme organised by Deccan Herald and Prajavani on November 26. Citizens wanted visitors and officials to walk or move around using a battery operated vehicle.The move had the backing of both officials and Horticulture minister M C Managuli, who expressed his support for the use of buggies.The previous director of horticulture, Y S Patil, had assured that the plan will be put in place in about one month with the purchase of buggies. However, even after a month, there is no sign of proposal seeing light of day. Officials at the horticulture directorate revealed to DH that the project has stalled due to change of guard at the department level.A few weeks ago, the state government transferred horticulture director YS Patil as Deputy Commissioner of Vijayapura and posted Dr M V Venkatesh as the director of the horticulture department.“The new director has taken charge recently and is briefed about the pending projects. We will also brief him about the problems raised by public, walkers and joggers and soon a ban on vehicles will be ordered as suggested by the minister,” a senior official from Lalbagh said.Meanwhile, the department has also hiked the entry fees to the gardens with effect from March 1. The entry and parking fee have been increased by Rs 5 to Rs 10 over and above the existing fee across various categories.	Horticulture Department,Lalbagh,Vehicle ban,	 Mar 06 2019
Here’s how a group of climbers can inspire you to hike	The city may be well-known for its music scene, but rarely mentioned is the passion for rock climbing and the opportunities hikers find in the nearby hills.Among the passionate group of trekkers is ‘The Climbing Project’, which inspires people to get outdoors and in the middle of nature. They invite many to explore the Turahalli forests, Ravugodlu and other scenic areas that also promise a good workout for the body.And what more, the group encourages those taking part in their programmes to let their Labradors and Great Danes to tramp along in their trekking expeditions. The group mainly holds workshops for people of all ages to prepare them to climb the toughest of terrains from boulders to hills. “The Project also wants to make climbing accessible for everyone,” its co-founder Saurabh Chauhan told DH.“Unlike other sports, climbing requires several equipments not so easily available in India and the ones available are expensive,” he said, adding that the project is aiming to buy the equipments for the use of the climbers. The gear can be bought from the funds raised out of workshops.As a sport, climbing is liberating; it enhances focus, strength and flexibility.“Climbing has different forms,” Chauhan explained. This includes, among other things, bouldering, sport climbing done in teams of two with protective ropes and bolts, traditional climbing on cracks in the terrain with removable gears.Beginning in 2017, the project has already trained 500 people in various forms of climbing.They host climbing adventures each weekend around the city, besides organising climbing trips once a month to Hampi, Mysuru and other places.

Green warriors, CSR funds come to Nandi Hills' rescue	An ongoing green initiative has helped revive ponds and lakes as well as increase green cover in Nandi Hills in the last three years.The Nandi Lake and Pataala Ganga have been revived through the untiring efforts of former IFS officer and noted environmentalist AN Yellappa Reddy’s Bangalore Environment Trust and the United Way Bengaluru - both of whom have used CSR funds to rejuvenate water bodies as part of the “Save Nandi Hills campaign”.According to a report on the campaign’s activities, Nandi Lake was in terrible shape, with uncontrolled removal of soil and dumping of waste and debris virtually destroying the lake.The NGO along with the district administration and zilla panchayat took up a scientific study to revive the lake. The feeder canals blocked for several years were cleared and rainwater was allowed to flow into the lake.Apart from that, kalyanis (small ponds) were also revived. One such kalyani, Paataala Ganga, was choked with silt. So, the feeder canals were cleaned and water is now flowing into the Paataala Ganga, which is now raising the water level up in the Amrut Sarovara. To enhance bio-diversity, tree plantation drives and seed ball throwing initiatives were also carried out.The fertile red soil, manure and cow dung was used to make the seed balls by engaging volunteers from various companies.Drastic changeAbout 2,000 saplings of native fruit and flower-bearing species have been planted since the campaign began. This has also discouraged the proliferation of eucalyptus, which is known to be harmful to soil and water.Speaking about the rejuvenation project, Special Officer to Nandi Hills, Ramesh N, said that a drastic change could be seen ever since the activities began.“Although the government allocates funds for improving and maintaining Nandi Hills, it is not enough especially with the manpower crisis. The volunteers come in hundreds, take up the task and finish it. More than funds, it the scientific method and the huge number of volunteers that is making the difference here,” Ramesh added.About 70 acres of Nandi Hills is controlled and maintained by the Horticulture department, while the remaining 3,500 acres of land is under the forest department.

Begur residents install tilting dustbins	The residents of Begur on Sunday installed tilting dustbins along the Begur road with the help of the BBMP, as they spread awareness on cleanliness.While residents fixed the dumpsters under the banner of Federation of Beautiful Begur, women and children in the locality participated in a walkathon.“Around 12 tilting dustbins were sponsored by the corporator of Begur ward, Anjanappa, and the Redbridge International Academy. The installation was done by volunteers. Half of the work has been completed. We will complete the rest in the coming weeks,” said K Prakash, vice president, Federation of Beautiful Begur.Other campaignsThe citizens group will also take help from the Palike to install e-toilets soon as part of their ‘Beautiful Begur’ campaign.The federation celebrated its 52nd week of the Swachh Begur cleaning drive with the programme ‘Parikrama’ on Sunday by conducting a walkathon. As part of the event, they also conducted a free health camp for BBMP workers.“We’re working to support the government machinery to complete the pending civic works. We still don’t have the Cauvery water connection, which will be our top priority. We also want good roads,” Prakash added.	Begur,waste management,	 Mar 04 2019
We proved them wrong: Team Tarini	The team of Six Indian Navy women called Tarini, the first Asian team to circumnavigate the globe in eight months, interacted with Mount Carmel college students.It was a part of National Geographics’s #GirlsWhoSailed initiative, ahead of International Women’s Day.Just like the sail, the crew comprising Lieutenant (Lt) Commander Pratibha Jamwal, Lt Commander Aishwarya Boddapati, Lt Commander P Swathi, Lt Commander S Vijaya Devi and Lt Payal Gupta, was lead by Lieutenant Commander Vartika Joshi (skipper).“We never lost hope and never wanted to quit. We faced resistance from our parents and concerned senior colleagues. They said we might never return. But we proved them all wrong,” said the women crew. “This is the message we want to give everyone, especially women…that we are equal. Capabilities are important. The sea does not know male or female. It will not differentiate. Nothing in the world can stop us, if we decide,” they added.A film ‘Tarini’ has also been made chronicling their journey known as ‘Navika Sagar Parikrama’.On September 10, 2017, the team took off from Goa. Their gruel voyage of 254 days covering 21,622 nautical miles ended on March 21, 2018.The team recounted their two storms of 20 hours each. The worst being the one they encountered in the Southern Hemisphere, close to Antarctica, called the Graveyard of Ships. The speed of the storm was 200 kmph against boat’s speed of 6-12 kmph.The crew recollected their experience in temperatures of 45 degree Celsius, 15 degree Celsius, zero degree Celsius and -7 degree Celsius.They recalled how they cut Chocowalnut cake when they crossed the Equator at 4.50 am, as a ritual to King Neptune, and sang Happy Equator song (reprised version). They recollected how they would touch earth each time they landed on ports and some lighter moments of fights and birthdays.Lt Commander Swathi said unlike solo circumnavigations, they had each other. The team drew inspiration from their trainer and first solo (2009) circum-navigator Dilip Done.“But it was difficult to leave families and others behind on this long voyage, especially for me as I was the only one who was married. We not only built a bond among ourselves, but also with the boat as we saw it getting built from a price of wood,” she said.	National Geographic,Tarini,Mount Carmel College,	 Mar 02 2019
Govt plans to modify guidelines to regularise houses 	The state government on Thursday hinted at modification of guidelines for regularisation of houses in BBMP limits under Akrama-Sakrama scheme, in an apparent move to woo members of low income groups ahead of the forthcoming Lok Sabh polls.“The coalition government will consider modification of guidelines under Akrama-Sakrama scheme for properties falling within the 18-km radius of BBMP limits,” said Revenue Minister R V Deshpande.He was speaking at a function to issue possession certificates to over 10,000 beneficiaries.Deshpande said that the government itself hads completed property registration process to avoid inconvenience to beneficiaries.The Revenue department had digitised the entire process to ensure transparency. Last date to obtain possession certificates under 94C of Karnataka State Land Revenue Act (KSLRA) had been extended till March 31, he said.Deshpande said that the government would issue cultivation slip to farmers cultivating government lands outside BBMP limits.The process of disposing applications relating to bagair hukum lands has been speeded up, he added. Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy said that the government had received several representations seeking possession certificates to people who had constructed houses illegally in the BBMP limits, and the request would be looked into.The government had already transferred 1,600 acre land to construct group houses in the BBMP limits. While the state and the Central governments would contribute Rs 1.5 lakh for each beneficiary, the beneficiary contribution will be Rs one lakh.	akrama-sakrama,guidelines for low income groups,	 Mar 01 2019
BIFFES 2019: Hattrick will sweep you off your feet	The organisers of the 11th Edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival picked Iran as the focus country and the audience couldn't get enough of the films from the region. Not only were a variety of films showcased from Iran, but viewers also braved long lines to catch most of them. Hattrick, a film by Ramtin Lavafi, was one such film which saw a packed theatre. The film had the audience rapt in attention and also evoked from them apt reactions. From the 'oohs' to 'wow' and even whistles. Hattrick is a film that tells a story, creates immense mystery, has light moments and yet is simple. The simplicity lies in the film's narration. Set in not more than three to four locations, the entire film travels deep into the characters' lives. As the story unravels, the audience will feel the shock, sadness and joy along with Farzad (Amir Jadidi), his wife Lida (Parinaz Izadyar), their friend Keivan (Saber Abar) and his girlfriend Raha (Mahoor Alvand).The main plot of Hattrick begins with the four friends on their way to their homes from a party when Farzad, who is driving, hits something or someone, yet chooses to drive away. They are engulfed with worry, guilt and even anger. What follows is just discussion that leads from one thing to another and brings in focus some uncomfortable truths and hypocrisy of the characters. But Hattrick is not your everyday thriller which will keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Rather, it is an entertaining piece of cinema which conveys some serious messages without creating any tension. Like a funny instance when Lida, who is tired of husband's immaturity, keeps storming away from him in anger, and each of the time, Farzad quips- 'She will return'. Those instances were greeted with laughter by the audience, but all it showed was how Farzad had taken Lida for granted amidst all his follies and childish decisions. In fact, Amir Jadidi and Parinaz Izadyar play their characters to such perfection that even though one will find Farzad's emotions childlike and beautiful, we hope Lida never returns to Farzad (keep an eye out for the scene where Farzad is engrossed in TV while in the background Raha and Keivan are involved in a serious discussion)At times, films that have nothing but only conversations tend to move at a slow pace, but not Hattrick. With every conversation, the audience is clueless if it will be a serious revelation or a fun, everyday joke. Either of the two will definitely keep you glued to your seats till the very end. All four main actors win every scene that is beautifully placed by Lavafi. Lavafi not only speaks volumes with small scenes, but he is successful in creating a lasting impression on the audience's mind with this masterpiece. Hattrick is a no-miss and totally worth a shot!Hattrick will be screened at the BIFFES 2019 on February 28, Thursday at 4:20 pm at Screen 5.	Cinema,Film festival,Biffes 2019,BIFFES,Iran,	 Feb 27 2019
BIFFES 2019: Great cinema, serpentine lines on weekend	"On the third day of the 11th Edition of the Bengaluru International Film festival, visitors turned up in large numbers and had an exciting line-up of film to catch up on. According to the Artistic Director of BIFFes, N Vidhyashankar, the weekend saw almost 15 to 20 thousand visitors thronging the PVR to watch a film. Among almost 50 national, international and regional films a serpentine line was seen for films like The Guilty (from Denmark), Ranganayaki (a classic Ambareesh starrer Kannada film ) and 3 faces (from Iran) among several others on the third day of the festival. Amidst the craze for these critically acclaimed films, visitors also found joy in finding out that food at the PVR cinema was served at slashed prices. ""The food prices are cut by almost 70%. We have picked the best selling food and cut down the prices for the visitors. The organisers want people to enjoy the festival to the fullest,"" a PVR staff said. DH caught up with some of the visitors for their verdict on the first three days of the festival. ""I did not come here on the first day, but the last two days have indeed felt like a festival,"" Dhruv, a literature student said. He rushed from one screen to another to watch films that he had been waiting for. ""I wanted to watch The Burning (a South Korean film) but missed it because my friend wanted to watch The Wild Pear Tree. And then I caught with Shoplifters (a Japanese film). later on, in the day I managed to watch two more films, not fully though,"" Dhruv says who walked out of the screen before the films ended so that he could watch other films. Though the visitors realise it is practically impossible to watch all the movies scheduled, they did not expect the crowd that welcomed them at every screen. Like Raagini P, a corporate communications executive had planned to watch The Guilty but had to settle for The Realm owing to a long line and filled the theatre. ""I think the BIFFes has attracted an amazing response. It is also the weekend crowd but not something I expected,"" Raagini says. Her friend, Sneha, a content writer agrees about the crowd and suggests multiple screenings of some of the popular films might help ease the crowd. ""Some popular films are lined up at the same time, maybe they could be screened again,"" she says. ""They could also create a list of 'hist-list' of films the visitors could watch. Many of them are clueless about what to watch,"" Sneha adds.However, Raagini and Sneha like several others have no complaints about the kind of the genre of the scheduled films. ""The list caters to all kinds of film enthusiasts. I think it is a good mixture of all kinds of films,"" Raagini says. They also have a suggestion to tackle the problem of visitors waiting in long lines for a film, but ending up reaching the door to a filled theatre. ""A facility to book slots online might solve so many problems. it will also give an idea to visitors and the organisers about the footfall,"" Raagini says. ""The energy here is amazing. I love everything about the BIFFes except for the long line. Maybe next year they should have more venues to screen the films. Though a single venue is great, it is small for the number of people,"" Preeti, a techie said. Sharath Kumar, a software professional feels it is natural and visitors should have patience. ""The quality of films, the variety and the convenience of being in one venue are the positives of BIFFes. Naturally, several people will come to enjoy the experience. We have to enjoy even the long lines, be civil in it and savour the fruit of patience- the films,"" he says."	Film festival,Biffes 2019,BIFFES,	 Feb 24 2019
"@KarachiBakery tweets ""Absolutely Indian"" by heart"	"Two days after the iconic Karachi Bakery in Indiranagar in East Bengaluru was in the spotlight after a group of ""patriots"" came and threatened to take out the name ""Karachi,"" the Hyderabad based Karachi Bakery clarified on Saturday that it was ""absolutely Indian.""In a tweet @KarachiBakery, it said ""We would like to clarify that Karachi Bakery was founded by Shri. Khanchand Ramnani, who migrated to India during the partition. The brand was established in 1953 and is an Indian company based out of Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The popularity and love for its products has contributed to its growth throughout India and abroad. The essence of Karachi Bakery is absolutely Indian by heart and will remain so. We request everybody to refrain from any kind of misconceptions.""#KarachiBakery pic.twitter.com/S5KHB7Nm0b— Karachi Bakery (@KarachiBakery) February 23, 2019Sections of the media reported even other outlets of Karachi Bakery in Bengaluru have also received threatening calls since February 17 from groups demanding that the firm should change its name or shut down the business, employees said. Employees at the company’s Mahadevapura outlet said that they had complained to the police about the calls.Nine people have been arrested by the Indiranagar police who have been booked for unlawful assembly, and criminal breach of trust. Among the nine, seven of them claimed that they were all social workers and were ""patriots"" locally, the police quoted them as saying.Meanwhile, the East division police also claim that they have been receiving calls stating the arrested men have affiliations with Right-wing outfits.Around 20 men, on Friday, had barged into the bakery and questioned as to why the bakery had such a name and also demanded to know who the owner was. However, they did not resort to damage property. The bakery staff had called the police after which they covered the word “Karachi” from the signage and even put a national flag in front of the bakery. The Indiranagar police have put up picketing near the outlet and other sensitive areas in the East division to avert such instances."	Karachi Bakery,Indiranagar,Bengaluru,	 Feb 24 2019
Being Kashmiri in Bengaluru, in aftermath of Pulwama	"Within minutes of the ghastly terror attack at Lethpora in Pulwama, I got a call from my dad, who is currently camping in Srinagar. The tone was dejected, and very worried – a concern for my well-being in distant Bengaluru.“Furquan, be extra cautious, sentiments are going to be high. Don't engage with anyone and make sure the rest of the family is also safe,"" he said.In pursuit of my daily story, I brushed away my father's concerns thinking he had fallen prey to the hysteria. And I had a reason for that -- I have called Bengaluru my home for years and it's my home and my identity. And I have never felt unwanted, much less hated, or unsafe here so far.MUST READ | Full Coverage on Pulwama Terror AttackThe next morning, when the nation was engrossed in the tragedy that had taken the lives of over 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans, everything seemed to be normal. But within hours of the cabinet committee on security (CCS) meeting, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was speaking at the inauguration of Vande Bharat Express, his words at the public gathering in Varanasi sent shivers down my spine. ""Iss hamle ki vajah se desh mein jitna aakrosh hai, logon ka khoon khol raha hai; ye main bhalibhaanti samajh pa raha hoon. Iss samay jo desh ki apekshaen hain, kuchh kar guzarne ki bhavanaen hain, vo bhi s‍vabhavik hain. (The rage in the country due to this attack is making the blood of the people boil; I understand this very well. At this time, there is also the feeling that something needs to be done. That’s also natural).”If my dad could anguish about what could be a ‘natural’ response to such a gruesome terror attack, the Prime Minister of 130 crore people, I thought, would also have an idea of it. Surprisingly, there was no appeal to maintain communal harmony at such a time -- and one still hasn’t come!Soon after the prime minister’s speech, a glimpse at Twitter feeds showed that my dad’s concerns no longer seemed so misplaced as it had earlier. It was not just Pakistan that was the target of hatred and anger, but also Kashmiri Muslims. Twitter was filled with comments spewing venom on the community. Former Infosys CFO and Modi’s camp follower T V Mohandas Pai tweeted: ""Kashmiri Shops in Tourists Spots -- Is there more than what meets the eye? Are such shops becoming money-laundering outfits? Needs investigation, worrisome"".In his tweet, Pai tagged Modi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, while quoting a link from Sanjeev Nayyar, who in an article on May 1, 2018, had tried to normalise the rape of a young Bakkarwal girl from Kathua. It is surprising that despite the backlash on Pai's tweet, none of the ministers tagged have taken cognizance of it and come out with an appeal for calm.Social media is helping amplify anger and hate. The effects are evident on the streets. I am personally witnessing it. The security guard outside my home in Bengaluru who till three days ago used to greet me cheerfully every day had nothing but a cold, hateful stare in store for me. The driver of an autorickshaw I was travelling in was fine until he heard me talking over the phone in Kashmiri. His attitude changed immediately. The immediate, although not life-threatening consequence was a demand for Rs 20 more over the meter-fare. The man knew I could not afford to pick up a fight over it with him, now that I had exposed myself as a Kashmiri. I paid up without a murmur.Among the experiences of my Kashmiri friends, one sent me an SOS when her accommodation in a serviced apartment in a posh locality in Bengaluru got cancelled. The real estate agent sent her the following message: ""We will not provide the apartment to you and you know the reason"".In another case, a group of Kashmiri students pursuing graduate studies in the city was threatened, after a fellow Kashmiri college-mate, whose behaviour they had no connection with, put up a highly insensitive Facebook post over the February 14 terror attack.As I began to see the hate poison spreading, I tweeted: ""My heart and home are open to anyone in need of help. Please feel free to message me"". There was nothing political or communal in that tweet, but the right-wing Twitterati had to barge in. ""U mean any Muslim in need of help,"" replied one Kailash Chatterjee; another, by the Twitter, handle name of Daniel Semah tweeted: ""Say people who raped and butchered thousands of KPs in cold blood.""Pardon my ignorance, but which among us Kashmiri Muslims have ""raped and butchered thousands of KPs in cold blood"". Not that I need to prove it to anyone, but I have been closer to Kashmiri Pandits than to Kashmiri Muslims for the most part of my life so far. The hate messages are not dying down with time, they are being ratcheted up in a calibrated manner even as the prime minister went from “I can understand people’s blood is boiling” on day 1 of the tragedy to “My blood is boiling” on day 3. So much so that I’m beginning to sweat at the thought of having to leave home for work. That, thousands of miles away from Kashmir, in Bengaluru."	Jammu and Kashmir,Pulwama Attack,CRPF,	 Feb 18 2019
Father awaits missing son at the Majestic parking lot	A 50-year-old father has been waiting for his 14-year-old son at the Kempegowda Bus Station for the past two days.B S Nikhil left after parking his bicycle, informing the guard to take care of it until he returns from Hyderabad in three days.Nikhil, a 9th standard student of Carmel School in Padmanabhanagar, left his house on February 15, after his mother told him to do better in studies.Nikhil’s father B Srinivasulu, a businessman and a resident of Bhuvaneshwari Nagar in Banashankari III stage, searched for Nikhil everywhere soon after. He visited the houses of Nikhil’s friends. Finally, one of Nikhil’s classmates told Srinivasulu that Nikhil was upset about his mother’s words.Nikhil is not able to focus on studies, so he decided to leave the house and go to Hyderabad to do some odd jobs, the classmate told Srinivasulu.Thereafter, Srinivasulu rushed to the City Railway Station and searched for the bicycle and inquired about Nikhil, showing his photograph around.The guard there told Srinivasulu that Nikhil had indeed visited the station and as the parking was expensive there, he decided to go the Kempegowda Bus Station and park there instead.Also, there were not many trains to Hyderabad at that time, the guard told the boy’s father. Srinivasulu then got hold of CCTV footage of Nikhil on his bicycle in the Majestic area. After visiting the Kempegowda Bus Station’s parking, Srinivasulu found Nikhil’s bicycle there.The guard at the station told Srinivasulu that the boy bargained for Rs 200 for three days parking, and said he was going to Hyderabad, to return in three days.Now, Srinivasulu is waiting for Nikhil at the bus station’s parking lot, hoping that his son would return home.

Protest against ‘anti-student’ policies held in City 	Students, teachers, lawyers, academics and rights activists from different groups and walks of life assembled together at Town Hall here on Saturday evening to protest against the Central Government’s ‘anti-student’ education policies and to extend solidarity to the ‘Dilli Chalo’ movement. The programme began with a prayer and a minute of silence to pay respect to the soldiers who lost their lives in the Pulwama terror attack. Then, there were several speeches, slogans, songs and colourful placards that proclaimed their interest to ‘stop the communalisation, centralisation and commercialisation’ of education in India.Explaining to DH the reason for holding such a protest, Neenu Suresh, a research scholar of National Law School (NLS) and a member of the Bengaluru Collective, who along with the student group called the Student Outpost (TSO) organised the protest, said that their aim was to originally hold a seminar but then felt the need to protest to give students a voice.“It’s not actually a sudden thing and as we know in Karnataka, there is a limitation on student unions and protests here. So this meeting becomes all the more important. When students across the country have been protesting for the past five years against many different government measures such as slashing of scholarships, cutting of research grants and plans of scrapping the UGC, students of Bengaluru, which has many premier institutions of the country, felt that they must come out and show solidarity with other student struggles,” she argued.Shalom, an organising member of the TSO, also addressed the crowd whose composition included a wide range of local institutions and urged the students of Bengaluru to pull together to overturn the ban on student unions.“We, the students of Bengaluru, are afraid of politics and are apathetic to it. No student unions are allowed to represent our interests even though we have nominated councils that organise our college festivals. Until we don’t demand and ask our college management to grant us our rights, how do we expect to fight the government on bigger questions of justice? I urge you all to go back to your colleges and demand revocation of the student union ban,” said Shalom.When questioned, other students cited other instances of government policies that prompted them to attend such an event.“Communalisation of education is attacking the very basis of knowledge and we have seen the willful distortion of history by the present government, which is encouraging dangerous trends such as Islamophobia and Casteism,” said Ardra, a 23-year-old student.Suvarat, a researcher at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), meanwhile, lamented that the fact the current government has not delivered on its promises on education. “They had pledged 6% GDP spending on education in their manifesto but what we saw was less than 3% in 2018. The other issue is that with increased privatisation, as is the case with the US where publicly taxpayer-funded research will continue to create breakthroughs but the profits and benefits will be passed on to the private players,” he argued.	protest,Bengaluru,	 Feb 17 2019
‘Pakodanomics’ & jobs discussed at meet on employment	‘Pakodanomics’, the right to work, unemployment data and student protests and movements were some of the themes on which students raised questions as they put their youth political leaders on the hot seat during a public meet on employment issues held here on Saturday. A packed hall of students in Gandhi Bhavan’s Bapu Hall in Kumara Park kicked things off in the morning with political songs as they welcomed Gururaj Desai from the Student Federation of India (SFI), Surabhi Dwivedi from the National Students' Union of India (NSUI) and Ashish Chauhan from Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) to start the first panel discussion.Asha Kotwal of the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch (AIDMAM), the moderator of the first session, began the discussion by asking the speakers to express their views on the recent row over the ‘leaked’ National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) data which has pegged India’s unemployment rate at 6.1% during the 2017-2018 period.In her opening remarks, Surabhi from NSUI condemned the government for its attempt at data suppression and asserted that the youth of the country is frustrated and “fed-up” with the government’s “fake promises”. “We have a Prime Minister who advocates for Pakodanomics. At the risk of being charged for sedition, I’d like to ask, How’s the josh? Where are the jobs?” she questioned. However, Chauhan retorted by underplaying the issue as he argued that the problem of unemployment is not unique to us and is happening all over the world. “We are debating one report which is not even officially released yet. If you see the International Labor Organisation (ILO) reports, it has pegged the official unemployment rate at around 3.6-3.7 %. Our economic growth in the past five years has been tremendous while inflation has halved. Meanwhile, there are crores of jobs that have been created according to EPF data. We can further improve the employment situation by implementing the Kothari Commission recommendations and strengthening Mahatma Gandhi’s ideas of ‘Bunyadi’ (Foundational) education,” asserted Chauhan. Ashish’s statistics were then rebutted by Desai of SFI who claimed that according to central government data, 1.15 crore youth pass out of colleges every year but only around 5 Lakh manage to find employment.“Instead of adding employment to education and healthcare, the Modi government is experimenting with us through contractual employment wherein temporary workers with no job security get paid half of what the permanent workers are paid for doing for the same amount of work. Modi and Rahul Gandhi have both made a lot of statements and though ‘surgical strikes’, ‘acche din’ and ‘beti bachao’ are catchy slogans, the youth shouldn’t be swayed,“ he argued. During the question-answer round with the students, speakers were questioned about how their political parties plan to improve the employment situation in India. Dwivedi from NSUI said that some suggestions by Congress in light of upcoming elections included advocating for creating a student right’s commission on the lines of the national women’s commission and granting of unemployment allowances while Desai argued for employment to be guaranteed and strengthened as a fundamental right. The audience also broke into raucous laughter at one point during the Q & A when Chauhan from NSUI was asked by a student as to when PM Modi will be sending Rs 15 Lakh to his bank account and when the Ganga will be cleaned. Chauhan responded to the question by saying that the government is making efforts to bring back illicit cash that is stashed abroad. He then asserted that the Ganga has been cleaned which again invited hysterical laughter from the crowd. “I went to Prayagraj on the occasion of Vasant Panchami and I assure you that you can take a dip at the Triveni Sangam. Why are Siberian birds coming back to India after decades? Did PM Modi send them Visas?” he asked. Another panel discussion on student movements was also held post lunch. The panel discussions were organized by Azim Premji University’s Centre for Sustainable Employment and Samvada, a collective that works on youth issues.	ABVP,Unemployment,NSUI,	 Feb 17 2019
Antinatalists gather in B'luru; pledge child-free life	"Antinatalism is gradually gaining ground in the city. As many as 40 people came together on Sunday morning calling upon the public to opt for a child-free life.Members of Child-Free India gathered in front of the Mantri Mall, Malleswaram and pledged a child-free life. Stating that procreation was wrong, the antinatalists said human misery could be avoided if people simply did not exist in the first place.Pratima Naik, an engineering graduate from Bengaluru who helped to make the group's first national meet a reality, said those born into our miserable world are doomed to suffer. According to her, new people are also capable of inflicting pain on the rest.""Being born means to suffer, as well as feeling pleasure. But the foregoing of pleasure is not as bad as the presence of suffering. Therefore, it is nothing but ideal for humanity to stop reproducing and go extinct,"" she said.Prasanth, another member of the group, said the participants told everyone why they were opting for a child-free life and the reasons for the same.""Humans are creating a lot of problems for themselves and other species. More humans will accelerate the degradation of society and the environment,” he said.Pratima has created a Facebook page - Child-free India - with more than 380 followers. The page carries regular posts on antinatalism.Sunday's meet is part of a series of preparatory events to make antinatalism popular. The meeting ended with the committee drafting a set of resolutions that will provide a basis for the movement to convince young people who are willing to think deeper about issues related to life and suffering.In a release, the group said a core team has been formed to decide how to expand the network by spreading awareness in various metros."

Jakkur Lake to be surveyed for studying encroachment	"The BBMP will do a survey of the Jakkur Lake to determine if there are encroachments by a private builder.People living close to the lake have complained that the private builder is constructing a building in the lake's buffer zone, prompting Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun to inspect the waterbody on Thursday.In a letter to the BBMP commissioner, the mayor asked him to depute the revenue DC to do the survey and determine whether the private construction is an encroachment on the lake and whether it would harm the waterbody.During the inspection, residents living near the lake complained that the sewage water from the treatment plant is allowed into the borewells in the area.Manjunath (name changed) said: ""Construction activities are going on for the past couple of weeks inside the lake's buffer zone limits. Officials need to check if NGT rules are violated."" He also said the sewage water coming out of the STP unit is mixing with the borewell water. ""The sewage water is entering homes,"" he added.After listening to the complaints, the mayor said it is not clear whether the NGT rules are violated due to the lake's current situation.""The Bangalore Development Authority handed over the lake to the Palike in 2015 after development works. Also, 41 of 161 acres was handed over to the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board to build the STP and to create wetland,"" she said.""There's no clarity on the buffer zone rules on BWSSB. The building work is right now taking place at the area handed over to the BWSSB. I’ll hold a meeting with both the BDA and BWSSB and resolve the issue,"" Gangambike assured.Deputy Mayor B Bhadregowda, ruling party leader Abdul Wajid and JD(S) party leader Netra Narayan were also present during the mayor's inspection of the lake.S Vishwanath from Biome Environmental Trust, who has worked extensively in rejuvenating the lake, said turtles were spotted in the lake a couple of months ago.""We've used different methods over the years to improve the quality of water in the lake,"" he said. ""This could be one of the reasons why we found the turtles. This was not there before."""	Jakkur Lake,BBMP,	 Feb 08 2019

Students design ‘portable and cheap’ Braille converter	A newly designed handheld Braille converter is making life easy for the blind.Now, the blind can walk into a library, pick up a book of their choice and allow the converter to transcribe it for them.The device, BBook, which converts text into Braille real-time, is the brainchild of two Computer Science Engineering students -- Rohit N and Ruchitha D J—belonging to Bengaluru’s MVJ College.Inventors of the device explained that the scarcity of Braille books –less than 1% of the printed books are transcribed into Braille- as the major reason behind designing the converter.Braille books are heavy and unwieldy, they point out. For instance, a 500-page Braille book weighs at least four kilos. Moreover, they cost ten times more than regular books.Hooked to the internet, the BBook can also download news articles and magazines and transcribe them for the user’s benefit.“Characters are picture-mapped and converted to Braille,” Rohit told DH, adding that the device allows the blind to access books that remained out of reach for them.Besides the hard copy, BBook can convert even digital materials. “These could either be in PDF or Word format,” Rohit said. “Digital books can be converted letter-by-letter.”The Braille converter was among several products on display at the Visweswaraya Industrial and Technological Museum on Saturday.“Initially, we weren’t sure if the product would make a difference. We visited Sri Rakum School for the Blind in Indiranagar and interacted with the teachers. With their encouragement, we took two months to work on the converter,” Rohit said.They tested the proto-type of the product with the blind students of Rakum School. “The students have suggested some minor changes and we’re working on it. Once the product is ready to be marketed, we expect its price to be below Rs 5,000,” Rohit said.	Braille,Bengaluru,	 Feb 06 2019
Volunteers paint street walls, transform cityscape	Every weekend over 20 volunteers including artists come together to transform the cityscape into vibrant spaces of colour and positivity.The group redecorates public walls, children’s homes, playgrounds, government schools and such, with meaningful doodles.As part of the ‘Paint For a Cause’ project, the volunteers have already painted over 20 street walls so far. To start with, the walls are cleaned up and whitewashed. Further on, they are painted upon with beautiful art, doodles and motifs, accompanied by inspiring messages. The area around the walls would otherwise be misused by the public, especially to urinate in the open and dump garbage. The ‘Paint for a Cause ‘ project is an initiative by Smileys India, a volunteer organisation that started functioning in 2015, with an aim to support NGOs and government structures through the medium of art. The volunteers are set to restore the Brahma Kumari Road in Koramangala - a stretch rundown with garbage dumped near the walls. The restoration effort, titled the Dyudle Art movement, is being organised in collaboration with the Dyu Art Cafe. The idea is to beautify the street walls of Koramangala in the coming weeks.“Now, people have stopped spitting and urinating. They are taking selfies instead, standing along the painted footpath and chatting. This is a welcome change and the very intent behind the whole project,” says Vidushi Jayaswal speaking about the success of the project.	Bengaluru,Paint For a Cause,	 Feb 06 2019

Ornamental plants to add to Lalbagh's allure	New ornamental plants will add to the beauty and allure of Bengaluru's Lalbagh Botanical Garden in the coming days.The Baobab saplings that were planted two months ago near DHO Lawn are growing in height, providing an aesthetic appeal.“Around five saplings have been planted already. In the coming days, the trees are going to grab everyone’s attention, that’s how beautiful they are,” said N Jagadish, joint director (parks and plantations), Horticulture Department.Jagadish said the water holding capacity of the Baobab tree, which originated in African, is its most fascinating feature.“Baobab can hold around 15,000 to 20,000 litres of water in its roots and can live for more than 6000 years. We have chosen it because of all these aspects,” Jagadish said.Another tree named Beggar’s Bowl, which has been planted in the parking lot, yields ornamental fruits. “All the branches yield fruits in the shape of a bowl,” said Jagadish.Five saplings were planted recently along with the three existing ones. “These trees are easy to maintain. We have to occasionally water them for some months,” Jagadish added.Terminalia Mentali, a flower-bearing tree, will be another attraction in the parking lot. Also, a garden, called Sankan Garden, is being constructed close to the lake and is expected to bear plants from marshy areas and those that need more moisture to survive.

""The police had identified 49 blackspots in the city and took several measures, which helped bring down the number of crime cases from 793 to about 600 over the past two years. However, the general public should do their part to become active players in upholding safety on the road,"" he said.Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Alok Kumar expressed concern over commuters bypassing traffic rules.

Teens’ app to spot eye defect in kids	An app developed by two teenaged brothers to detect a defect in the eye has won the Grand Prize at the IRIS National Fair, India’s largest research-based science fair for students.Vrishab Krishna and Vishwesh Krishna, both students of National Public School, Indiranagar, will now represent India at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.Their app, Kanna, is a result of the brothers’ mission to ensure that a defect in children’s eyes does not go undetected. The teens claim to have come up with the solution after Vrishab had Amblyopia as a young boy.When Vrishab was four and his brother Vishwesh two years older set out to play, the elder sibling would catch a ball that was thrown at him with ease. However, Vrishab, unlike most children of his age, would be left perplexed. When children his age could just run down the stairs, Vrishab would watch every step and take longer.Multiple visits to ophthalmologists yielded no results. His mother Gayathri Krishna was told that he had long sight and that it would be fine as he grew older. She refused to buy the explanations of the doctors.“I noticed that in a few photographs, he was cross-eyed. When Vrishab was in second year Montessori, he was exceptionally nervous when he was asked to write,” she recalled.She took him to a Bengaluru-based paediatric ophthalmologist who diagnosed Vrishab with Amblyopia.This is a condition where one eye functions better than the other. In other terms, one of them is a lazy eye. “One optic nerve is dominant over the other. The brain takes one set of signals. Over time, the other tends to become blind,” she said.Simply applying a patch on the lazy eye and having the other eye to do the functioning is a solution. However, early detection is the key.Kanna, the app developed by the boys ensures early detection, claim the teenagers. Users can just upload a passport-size picture on the app, which will soon be available online. With image processing and machine learning techniques, the app can identify the potential risk factors and hence, possible cases with just a picture from the smartphone. The boys are running a validation with data from 600 cases from Shankara Eye Hospital.“We hope to take it to rural eye camps where we can identify other kids early. Children ought to be detected before the age of eight, failing which it could result in blindness. Conventional methods are time-consuming and we can pick those with risk factors better,” said Vrishabh.	Bengaluru,	 Feb 04 2019
A big thumbs down to tree-felling for steel flyover	Civil society on Sunday upped the ante against the marking of trees to be felled, to make way for the proposed steel flyover between Basaveshwara Circle and Mehkri Circle.Hundreds of members from various green outfits took to the streets in protest against the move to fell trees in the heart of Bengaluru. The not-for-profit, Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB) launched a campaign, #MaraHatyeTadeYojane, urging the government not to cut trees down for the project.“In solidarity with our beloved trees, we have gathered in peaceful protest. The government is keen to announce yojanes that will destroy the precious green cover. In response, we would like to commit ourselves to a #MaraHatyeThadeYojane,” said Srinivas Alavilli, co-founder of CfB.DH had reported the marking of 144 full-grown trees along the stretch. The sudden move had drawn stiff opposition from all quarters with conservationists and environmentalists raising their voice against the project.CfB has also launched a postcard campaign against the marking of trees. More than 5,000 postcards have been sent to the Chief Minister in this regard.“Last week, 144 trees have been marked for felling on the Ballari Road by KRDCL, according to media reports. Since the KRDCL is the nodal agency for implementing the proposed elevated corridor project, it appears that the agency is making preparations for cutting the trees down. However, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is not done and there is no environmental clearance for the project,” Alavilli of CfB added.“There is massive public opposition as well because alternatives that do not involve killing trees such as public transport are not being considered. The BBMP has not given any permission to cut these trees. The marking of these trees is seen as a disregard for the rule of law and to public sentiment,” said a CfB member.

Acceptance & positive mindset: Tips by cancer survivors	Getting treated at the Kidwai Hospital for leukaemia as a seven-year-old, Dr Aarthi decided that she would one day return as a doctor treating children with cancer.Dr Aarthi, now 23, is pursuing her post-graduation and is hoping to live her dream as a paediatric oncologist. “It (becoming a doctor) was decided when I underwent treatment at Kidwai. It was also my mother’s desire,” Aarthi says.More than the patient, it is the caregiver who suffers the most. In Aarthi’s case, it was her mother Prabha who soaked up the pressure and stood by her side. “First and foremost, you must accept that your loved one has cancer,” Prabha says.“Acceptance is the most difficult part. Once you accept it, half the battle is won. The rest is all about thinking positively and fighting the battle. Miracles do happen. Doctors said my daughter had just a few months to survive. She not only survived, but is working to be a cancer specialist, too,” she adds.A miracle P S Parameshwaran’s story of surviving cancer is nothing but a miracle.

"Bengaluru,World Cancer Day,Getting treated at the Kidwai Hospital for leukaemia as a seven-year-old, Dr Aarthi decided that she would one day return as a doctor treating children with cancer.
Dr Aarthi, now 23, is pursuing her post-graduation and is hoping to live her dream as a paediatric oncologist. “It (becoming a doctor) was decided when I underwent treatment at Kidwai. It was also my mother’s desire,” Aarthi says.
More than the patient, it is the caregiver who suffers the most. In Aarthi’s case, it was her mother Prabha who soaked up the pressure and stood by her side. “First and foremost, you must accept that your loved one has cancer,” Prabha says.
“Acceptance is the most difficult part. Once you accept it, half the battle is won. The rest is all about thinking positively and fighting the battle. Miracles do happen. Doctors said my daughter had just a few months to survive. She not only survived, but is working to be a cancer specialist, too,” she adds.
A miracle 
P S Parameshwaran’s story of surviving cancer is nothing but a miracle. Such was his level of positive thinking that his blood group changed from B negative to B positive during the course of his treatment.
Parameshwaran thanks his older brother for donating his bone marrow, which gave him a new lease of life.
“Doctors couldn’t believe that my blood group had changed after the bone marrow transplant. My brother’s marrow suited me and helped me recover from the acute myeloid leukemia,” says the 50-year-old Parameshwaran.

Steel flyover: Residents protest against tree-felling	More than 300 residents on Sunday protested for marking the trees for felling to pave the way for the controversial steel flyover project between Basaveshwara Circle and Mehkri Circle in the heart of Bengaluru. Citizens for Bengaluru, an NGO, has launched a campaign #MaraHatyeThadeYojane. The residents urged the government to not to cut trees for the project. Recently DH had reported about the marking of 144 full-grown trees in the stretch. The sudden move drew universal opposition from conservationists and environmentalists. CfB has launched a postcard campaign against the marking of the trees. More than 5,000 postcards have been sent to the chief minister. “To show our solidarity with our beloved trees we have gathered in peaceful protest, the government is keen to announce various yojanes that seem to destroy our precious green cover. In response, we would like to commit ourselves a to #MaraHatyeThadeYojane,” said Srinivas Alavilli, member of CfB. pic.twitter.com/a34AurHqpp— Deccan Herald (@DeccanHerald) February 3, 2019 “Last week, 144 trees have been marked for felling on Bellary Road by KRDCL according to media reports. Since KRDCL is the nodal agency for implementing the proposed elevated corridor project, it appears that the agency is making preparations for cutting these trees. However, environmental impact assessment(EIA) is not done and there is no environmental clearance granted for this project,” he added. “There is massive public opposition as well because alternatives that do not involve killing trees such as public transport are not being considered. The BBMP has not given any permission to cut these trees. Marking these trees is seen as a disregard to rule of law and to public sentiment,” said another member.	protest,steel flyover,Palace Grounds,Citizens for Bengaluru,	 Feb 03 2019

Taking the ward committee meetings to the next level, the BBMP Commissioner also directed officials to publicise the property tax collection details from each ward during the ward meetings.Setting an example, the Commissioner himself has taken the initiative in his ward, Sanjaynagar.“I instructed my officers to make available ward-wise property tax collection details and also a list of all projects sanctioned by the BBMP for the last three years on the BBMP website,” BBMP Commissioner, N Manjunath Prasad said.The civic agency has also uploaded the details of the various projects undertaken in the wards from April 1, 2016 to January 31, 2019.“It’s first time in the BBMP’s history, ward-wise details of projects and tax collection data are made available to the public,” added Prasad. Earlier, the not-for-profit, Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB) had requested the Mayor, Gangambike Mallikarjun and the BBMP Commissioner to leverage ward committees to go beyond just grievance redressal and monitoring, and further look at ward-level planning and budgetary exercises.In November 2018, the CfB had also conducted a round table, where the BBMP commissioner said he expects the ward committees to become forums for transparency and planning.He had also said that the ward committee minutes will be posted on the website within two months.“This is truly a new chapter in urban governance and we are sure active citizens will use this information to better monitor ward works and better govern themselves. When citizens go beyond complaining and take ownership of their own wards, things will change dramatically,” Srinivas Alavilli, co-founder of CfB told DH.

Vogue clarifies on row, says students being misled	"The management of Vogue Institute of Fashion Technology, Bengaluru on Saturday clarified on the row, where few students have alleged the management misleading them during the admission. On Friday, 12 candidates, claiming to be the former students of Vogue Institute, who gave up the course for various reasons, alleged that the management was not returning their academic documents nor refunding the fees, and making them to run to pillar to post from past six months. They protested in front of the administrative office along with the support of Akhila Bharata Vidyarthi Parishat (ABVP) and took the assurance in written format from the management in the late night, after they called off the protest.Vogue Institute of Fashion Technology on further clarified on the allegations made by the students on approval of All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for the newly started courses. On Friday the members of Akhila Bharata Vidyarthi Parishat (ABVP) and students (claiming to be the former students of the institute) alleged that the college has not got valid approval from AICTE to start PGDM courses.Dr M M Kariappa, Founder and Chairman of Vogue Institute of Fashion Technology clarified that among 12 people who turned up, 11 of them are their students, who have attended the classes, practical examinations and internals held in December in their college. “There was one student who was also demanding to settle her dues. We remember returning her documents and refunding her fees long back. Rest of the students were very much part of our institution, and all of sudden on Friday they turned up protesting to return their documents. Even to return the document, there is a procedure to follow. How is it possible to return the documents and refund the fees in one day?,” asks Kariappa, by showing the valid proof of the affiliation for his institution from All India Council For Technical Education (AICTE).Cariappa surfaced the documents of getting approval from AICTE in April 2018. ""Ours is 23 year old institution, without valid approval its impossible to start any course. In April 2018, we got the approval for the PGDM course,"" Cariappa told DH, by surfacing the documents of getting approval from AICTE. He further added that these are all intended to tarnish the image of his institution. ""Students have been misguided by some people for their political and personal gains,"" he added. Asked him the reason behind the protest, Kariappa said, “I think these students have been misused by someone to their personal or political gains. I feel pity for them as they are spoiling their precious life. If at all they are demanding the settlement from past six months what is necessary for them to attend the class or take up the internals and practical examinations conducted by our college. So there is someone behind this, who is intended to tarnish the image of our institution and spoil students’ future.”The very first batch of the Vogue Institute’s PGDM program was commenced with 39 students. Since one person opted out after a week of the classes started, the strength was reduced to 38.A student, who is performing PGDM in Vogue also confirmed that those students were very much part of the class till Friday. “I don’t know what happened all of a sudden they were very much part of our classes. All of sudden we were shocked to see them protesting. What ever the allegations they are making are baseless. We have well qualified faculties and resource persons,” a student told DH."

Wood science institute ties up with schools	The Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST) has partnered with schools to tap people at the right age and sow the seeds of conservation.The IWST has tied up with Kendriya Vidyalaya (KV) and Navodaya Vidyalaya (NV) schools in Bengaluru to promote awareness about forests and environment.The MoU has been named ‘Prakriti’ and is the result of the partnership agreement inked between the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education in partnership with Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangha and Navodaya Vidyalaya Sangathan.Pankaj K Aggarwal, scientist, extension, IWST, told DH that for the first time an MoU has been signed with schools.The idea is to familiarise students about wood science, the museum, usage of wood and its importance. The aim is to also provide a platform for children to learn practical skills towards judicious use of wood.Inaugurated in 2012, the museum-cum-interpretation centre is one of its kind in Karnataka and receives around 2,500 people annually, mostly school and architecture students.At the museum, students can touch and feel the various types of woods, see the various colours, understand how to study the age of a tree and even know the tree’s history better. The museum also has a tree disc which traces the time since the British came to India until Independence.“Schools approach us individually to visit the museum when they get to know. But now we are tying up with them. In the first phase it is KV and NV. Gradually we will also tie up with private schools since educational tours are now a part of the curriculum,” he said.The IWST is also organising an awareness programme for children studying in classes VI-VIII in February.To reach out to the masses better, IWST has also decided to re-visit its two-year-old proposal of adding the museum to the city’s tourism map.N Mohan Karnat, director, IWST, said: “A proposal was made two years ago but it did not materialise. Now we are requesting the government and tourism department so that more visitors, especially students, can come. We are also working on adding more wood polymer made products in the museum to showcase innovations.”	Institute of Wood Science and Technology,	 Feb 01 2019

Freedom fighter, Gandhian among visitors to flower show	Many influential people joined the citizens to visit the 209th Lalbagh flower show on Sunday, the last day of the show.The show has been put together as part of the Republic Day celebrations in the city by the state Horticulture Department and the Mysuru Horticulture Society.Among the notable visitors were veteran freedom fighter H S Doreswamy and chairman of National Gandhi Memorial in Rajghat, Delhi, Annamalai who decided to visit the flower show after hearing about the replica of the Rajghat and the Sabarmati Ashram.The two were quite amused to see the floral displays inside the Glass House created to mark the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma. Several Gandhians, including those staying near the Wardha Ashram, visited Lalbagh on the last day of the flower show.But the Horticulture Department and the volunteers found it difficult to instil Gandhi’s message of cleanliness as visitors to the botanical garden littered the place with plastic bottles and carry bags. A mountain of plastic items was seen strewn around the place, despite a ban on their use.Lalbagh’s Deputy Director Chandrashekar M R said the department penalised 50 violators over the last 10 days and collected Rs 5,000 in fine. He insisted that the aim was to create awareness and not to punish people.The department had collected Rs 5,000 as deposit from the vendors who set up stalls at the flower show, which it would return if the area around the stalls is maintained well. But it would retain the deposit money and would levy further penalties if the stalls do not ensure the space is clean by January 28. Also, despite high security, the department was unable to keep away hawkers and illegal vendors who did brisk business at the garden.Official records reveal that the department collected Rs 29.22 lakh from 78,150 visitors on Sunday. Over the last 10 days, the department earned Rs 1,55,29,590 from the sale of tickets to 4,02,700 visitors.	Lalbagh Flower Show,Bengaluru,	 Jan 28 2019

Bosch's air quality study to help citizens 	German technology major Bosch is conducting a comprehensive study on air quality and local climate that would help governments and citizens plan daily activities like traffic management, commute and parking.A team from Bosch Mobility Solutions (BMS) has taken up a micro-climate monitoring system (Climo) study to assess the air quality in Electronics City and its surrounding areas on a pilot basis.They have installed an air quality measuring instrument to collect data on particulate matter (PM) 2.5, PM 10, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, Ozone, nitrous oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ranging temperature, noise pollution and humidity.Though the instrument was installed in September, the data collected so far will be analysed only in February, BMS’ head of city development Pawan Mulukutla told DH.Having installed 50 air quality measurement instruments in Pune with the municipal administration under the smart city programme, the seven-member BMS team has begun the pilot study in Bengaluru, though it has not partnered with the government here.However, the team has decided to share the data with the government to aid better planning. The BMS has partnered with the Electronics City for the project.Mulukutla said an average of the data collected is derived every 15 minutes and is used to understand seasonal, peak period and day variations.Unlike other studies, the BMS aims to overlay multiple factors on the data such as the traffic count, traffic management and health count and see if congestion in the city could be brought down. The BMS executive said the data will be gradually shared with the government, citizens and the companies to help decide such things as work timings, shifts, commute time, school timings, signal optimisation, parking management among other things.The team has set a one-year timeline to collect data, draw inferences and do the analysis.They say they are currently in the first stage. A similar Climo study has been taken up at Bosch campus in Koramangala and IISc campus.	Bosch,Bengaluru,	 Jan 26 2019

Techie shocked to find squatters in his home	A software engineer and the owner of a penthouse in HAL was in for a rude shock on his return from his native town of Mandya. Sravan Kumar was startled when he found squatters at his yet-to-be occupied southeast Bengaluru house.Recently, Kumar hired some men to renovate the house and had gone to his hometown. When he returned on January 22, he was shocked to find some people living in the house.42-year-old Kumar then filed a complaint of cheating and trespassing with the HAL police against a man and a few others -- men he claims to have hired to renovate his house, the police said.The police have taken up a case and asked Kumar to produce original documents of the house.“We have asked Kumar to furnish all the original documents of the property and are also questioning the builder to ascertain who has cheated whom,” a senior police officer said.Preliminary inquiries revealed the builder had executed a sale deed with Kumar. However, the builder has given possession of the same property to one Harisha, and a few others, who are made the accused.The complainant also told the police that some documents had been forged.Kumar purchased the penthouse in AECS Layout in Chinnapanahalli for Rs 26 lakh a couple of years ago from a builder named Rangaswamy.

Fertility clinic pays couple Rs 26 lakh	A consumer court has ordered a private hospital to pay Rs 26 lakh as compensation to a couple for medical negligence.The hospital was found guilty of negligence and deficient service while offering a specialised treatment to the pregnant woman who allegedly had a miscarriage as a result. Her husband made special efforts to learn the medical terminology to argue the case party-in-person at the consumer court.The couple, T H M Jagadeesha and his wife Sandhya reside in Kodichikkanahalli and work as software engineers in the city. Sandhya had two miscarriages since 2011, the first happening six weeks after conception and the second after 14 weeks.While looking for the specialised treatment to have a baby, Jagadeesha came across Cloudnine hospital on the internet. “The hospital claimed zero mortality and 99.72% survival rate of the babies. Its webpage also showed one Dr Leela Bhagavan as senior most consultant obstetrician and Gynecologist,” Jagadeesha said.The couple met Dr Leela Bhagavan and described the medical history. Sandhya was put on medication.In his complaint to the court, Jagadeesha said the doctor ignored watery discharge, lower backache, pulling sensation and bleeding, all within nine days of Sandhya’s conception. The complainant said the treatment lasted for 21 weeks and ended in miscarriage in June 2014. Right from the time she conceived, Sandhya has been visiting Dr Leela throughout the treatment period.In June 2014, Sandhya went to the hospital complaining discharge. The doctor ruled out infection and said it was due to poor hygiene. But when the condition did not improve eight days later, the doctor admitted there was infection and prescribed another medicine.On June 21, 2014, Sandhya was admitted to the hospital with severe backache and underwent a surgery.Jagadeesha said the doctor did not possess the requisite skills to deal with fertility and pregnancy issues. She promoted the medicines of a chain-linked company whose products are not approved by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. He also alleged that there was negligence on the part of the doctor and the hospital while examining the patient.The court held that the fact of the doctor’s qualification not being recognised by the MCI was evident when the hospital removed her qualification on its website after the issue came to light.“The doctor was aware of the fact that the patient had two abortions earlier and had a high risk,” the court noted.

DD against cash payment:HC notices to RBI, IBA and govt	The Karnataka High Court on Thursday issued notices to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) and the state government over the inaction of the public sector banks in issuing demand drafts (DD) against cash payments unless the customers had bank accounts.The court was hearing a PIL challenging the same. A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy was hearing a petition filed by advocate Ramesh Naik.Naik moved court seeking directions to all the public sector and commercial banks to follow their own direction pertaining to the ‘issue and payment for demand drafts’, and not to create hardship for the customer by insisting him/her to have a mandatory bank account or demanding only cheques for issuing demand drafts up to any amount less than Rs 50,000.The petitioner contended that a large number of people are facing hardship when transacting at public sector banks in their effort to get DDs for even small amounts like Rs 100, 200, 500 or 1000.On December 24, 2018, the petitioner, in order to ascertain this, had tried to obtain a demand draft for a small amount of Rs 100 in favour of the ‘District Consumer Redressal Forum’ by visiting a few public sector banks. All of them refused to issue the DD stating cash payment cannot be accepted, and the amount should be paid by cheque or the customer should have an account.The petitioner further added that RBI ‘Master Direction - Know your Customer (KYC) Direction 2016’, provides for the acceptance of cash payments of any amount less than Rs 50,000 for issuing demand drafts.The petitioner also told the court that The State Bank of India agreed to issue a DD for the amount of Rs 100, after he complained in writing to the manager of the concerned bank.The DD was issued on submission of the petitioner’s Aadhar card, while refusing to accept any other identity proof.The petitioner, on December 26, 2018, submitted a representation via e-mail to the jurisdictional banking ombudsman designated for the purpose by the RBI, explaining the issue, and requesting to address the grievance faced by people in obtaining a DD. However no action was taken.Thereafter the petitioner submitted a representation via e-mail again to the Indian Banks’ Association which again resulted in no response, following which the petitioner approached the court. The court has adjourned the hearing.	Karnataka High Court,	 Jan 25 2019

RT Nagar: 3-storey building tilts, residents evacuated	Residents of a 3-storey building, which tilted in Chamundi Nagar near RT Nagar early Wednesday morning, were immediately shifted to safety by the BBMP. According to the BBMP, the tilt appeared as digging was underway right adjacent to the building as part of a foundation laying. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike officials who rushed to house number 33, Manorayana Palya, also issued notices to the owners of the tilted structure and the adjacent site. “The building is over 20 years old and the adjacent site owner had dug up the ground for foundation laying. This resulted in the tilt. We have issued notices to both parties, and the tenants of the building have been shifted,” Prakash, assistant executive engineer, BBMP told DH.“The owner is demolishing the tilted building at his own expense after the notice. There were no casualties,” he added.“Three families live here. As the building is old it is tilting so precariously. In the night the residents were alerted, and by morning all were shifted,” Sajid Pasha, a local resident said.	3-storey building,	 Jan 24 2019

Bangalore varsity in a fix over ‘recruitment backlog’	The Bangalore University (BU) administration is now in a fix after inviting applications to fill up ‘long vacant positions’.Opposing the move, BU officials and research scholars protested by thronging the vice chancellor’s (VC) chamber on Wednesday.“We welcome the move. But there are a lot of irregularities in the procedure. Though there are no vacancies, senior BU officials are showing filled up seats as vacant, and have invited applications for the positions,” the protesters alleged.According to the protesters, though the deputy chief minister, Dr G Parameshwara, had ordered the VC to conduct an inquiry and stop the recruitment, the BU has openly invited the applications.“As there were allegations on BU officials over giving wrong information to the social welfare department, the deputy chief minister had ordered to freeze the recruitment. This shows the stubborn attitude of the VC. Isn’t there any value to deputy chief minister’s order?”asked a research scholar.“The separate committee was formed to identify the requirements of the backlog positions. But till date there is not even a single meeting chaired. If these people give positions to their candidates why would we need a committee. Government should conduct a proper inquiry into the matter,” said Mylarappa, director in-charge, BU distance education.Commenting on the development, BU VC Venugopal KR said, “I will be writing to the government. For now, I have written to the various departments asking for information on the backlog. After getting the information from the departments we will publish this on the website. Later, if there are any objections we will submit that to government. Thereafter, we will follow the government orders.”BU engineer suspendedMeanwhile, the higher education principal secretary has ordered the suspension of BU Engineer Puttaswamy, after an allegation that he misappropriated Rs 1.50 crore.“This will be discussed in the syndicate meeting scheduled on Thursday.

Child lock disabled in 42,000 cabs: Govt to HC	The child lock feature has been disengaged in 42,000 out of 2.5 lakh cabs in the state, the government submitted to the high court on Wednesday.In the next three months, the feature would be removed from the remaining cabs, it added.A division bench headed by Acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy was hearing the public interest litigation filed by Bangalore Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology seeking directions to the authorities concerned to disable the system in cabs in the wake of crimes being committed against women travelling in cabs.In the last hearing, the government had told the court that it had issued notices to the cab aggregators to deactivate the feature in taxis.The petitioner had filed the petition after being aggrieved by the inaction of the authorities in ensuring the safety of women travelling in cabs in Bengaluru and other parts of the state.The petitioner had contended that the child safety locks are built into the rear doors of most cars to prevent the rear seat passengers from opening the door while in motion, and this feature has been in existence since the 1980s in most cars. The intent was to provide the driver with a safe method to prevent children from opening the door, the petitioner said.The feature gets activated when one gets into the car. Once in the car, it is impossible for the passenger to open the door and run out in case of an emergency. The passenger is trapped inside and is at the mercy of the driver.The petitioner had further contended that despite increasing crimes against women in the city, the government and the authorities concerned have failed to take any action.Following the submission of the state to disengage the lock from the remaining cabs, the court disposed of the petition.	child lock system,Karnataka High Court,	 Jan 23 2019

Fire on BU campus, 4th incident this month	With winter yet to retreat and summer weeks away, the sprawling campus of the Bangalore University (BU) is already vulnerable to fire. In January alone four incidents were reported.The latest mishap occurred on Tuesday afternoon. At 1 pm, a fire was spotted opposite to the Pariksha Bhavan (examination block), which gutted at least 10 acres of land in the campus. Though the fire brigade was immediately rushed to the spot, they struggled to put the fire out until late evening.“This is not a wildfire. As there are a lot of dry leaves and grasses around the campus, some might have thrown a lit cigarette or lighted match stick. This would have set ablaze the dry leaves, only to be fanned by the hot sun and the afternoon wind. This is the fourth such incident this month,” a senior fire official told DH.As Tuesday was declared a government holiday, the regular traffic inside the campus was missing. Student and faculty were not present in the campus, which helped avoid a major mishap.As a precautionary measure, BU is housing a fire brigade to cater to the surrounding areas in the huge campus in order to avoid further fire accidents.“This is common this season. During the summer, our campus is more prone to such incidents. So, we have a fire brigade in place. Just like the wildfire is natural, some incidents are man-made,” a senior BU official told DH.

Petition in HC vs apartment complex coming up on ‘road’	"The High Court of Karnataka has issued a notice to the BBMP commissioner on a PIL petition against the development of a piece of land said to belong to the civic body. A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy on Monday heard a petition filed by advocate N P Amrutesh for preventing the development of the 2,544-square foot plot which he claims is a ""road"". The property is located along KR Road. The court also ordered notices to the chief engineer and the joint director of the town and country planning department and local BBMP officials. Amrutesh contended that the 24 feet X 106 feet property belongs to the BBMP but a builder has connived with owners of nearby plots to grab it.

A digital study room for PU students	"Students who are preparing for the upcoming PU board examinations can now turn to QBER - a digital study room. The digital interactive platform can be accessed through smartphones. Here, the students will collaborate, co-create, compete and help each other to answer questions put forth by experts.QBER, developed by IPOMO, trains students in a unique and innovative way somewhat similar to cricket coaching. QBER is often referred to as the 'question bowling machine'.Students just have to download the app, which then would deliver five most probable questions with a schema in all the subjects including science, commerce and arts. How it can be accessed The digital study room can be accessed on IPOMO's OnBimba app, or at https://onbimba.com/qber“The student can write the answers on a sheet of paper, click a photograph and post it on the platform. This will be reviewed by the experts in the respective subjects. Students from rural and urban areas will be a part of this community, free of cost.""A smartphone has become a part and parcel for students; we are making learning more interesting and innovative digitally. Keeping the writing part in mind, we have retained the pen and paper system,” Hariprakash Shanbag, MD, IPOMO, told DH.In 2018, as a pilot, QBER was launched in Seshadripuram College. After seeing a good response, the designers have opened the platform for everyone.Dr Wooday P Krishna, secretary, Seshadripuram Institute, said, ""QBER is a platform for the rural students, too, and can be termed as the digitisation of the good old 'combine study'. With QBER, students will also be able to develop their communication skills as well.”"	pre-university,Digital Study Room,	 Jan 19 2019
IISc research scholars protest Delhi police action	Nearly 300 research scholars sat on a 12-hour-long hunger strike at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) on Friday in protest against the detention of their peers in New Delhi. Calling the detentions “unconstitutional”, the scholars demanded a hike in the stipend and raised slogans against the authorities. “Our fellow research scholars were not causing any ruckus. It was just a silent protest march but police treated them as criminals. When thousands of miscreants are spared, why treat us so badly? Don’t we have the right to put forth our demands peacefully,” a protester asked.

App to identify homeless people	The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is developing an application to store facial recognition and other data of homeless people while conducting a homeless survey in all the 198 wards.The BBMP Information Technology (IT) department is developing the app and the civic body's welfare department officials will use this to store the data of homeless people and identify them.Speaking to DH, BBMP Special Commissioner, Randeep D said: “In all, officials at the 198 wards of the BBMP will conduct the survey of homeless people. We will collect data along with the facial recognition of the homeless people in an app which will be developed soon.”“Since the homeless people are often wanderers, we have to track them to take care of them in the urban centres. The app will store their photos, name and the centre or place where they have to stay,” he added.The Supreme Court in 2010 directed all the state governments to set up shelters for the homeless, especially in towns with a population of 1 lakh and more.The urban homeless survey by the BBMP along with Dream India Network and Impact India Consortium was completed in three major zones of the city in December 2018. Officials identified close to 1,200 urban homeless in the East zone itself. South and West are the other two zones where the survey was completed.The civic body has also identified 1,526 homeless people in the West zone and at least 2,200 in the South. The BBMP is planning to set up around 40 permanent shelters across the city for the homeless people by next winter. This would come as a huge relief for the thousands sleeping out in the open on the streets and pavements of Bengaluru.“We have completed the survey in East, West, and South zones, we will start the survey in other five zones soon,” Randeep explained.DH News Service	Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,homeless,	 Jan 18 2019

Penniless in Paris to shaking up art scene	Growing up in abject poverty in a Kolkata refugee camp, Shombit Sengupta landed in Paris with $8 in his pocket and even swept the floors for a living.Years later, this Indo-French artist would shake up the art world, pioneering a brand new movement called ‘Gesturism’, now all set for a Bengaluru showcase.In Sengupta’s own words, Gesturism is about art celebrating the limitless gestures of all living beings, of the movements of life itself. It was in 1994, a full 23 years after his daring foray into France, that Sengupta coined that word, one that would define how he captured impromptu, vibrant movements in his arresting paintings.On January 16, Sengupta’s Gesturism artworks themed ‘Hidden Figuratives’ will come alive at the city’s Gallery Time & Space. Vividly colourful, the paintings are dense with multiple layers of strokes. At first glance, the subjects are not well defined. But look deeper, and the figures would appear to move around on the canvas.But decades before his works inspired artists across the world, Sengupta had to endure extreme hardships in the slum-like refugee camp in Shohidnagar, about 50 km from Kolkata. The place had no electricity, sanitation or potable water.To escape this miserable state, “As a child, I would cross the Ganga into the erstwhile French Colony in Chandan Nagar. It was a different world, with Western architecture and promenades. The paintings of renowned European painters in the French museum library there inspired me,” Sengupta recalled.That sealed his determination to carve a niche for himself in European art. At the age of 19, he dared to be different, arriving virtually penniless in Paris. The culture shock hit him, yet he hung on. But his decision to stay put in the heart of Paris against all odds would change his destiny, forever.Sengupta wanted to be in the heart of French society. “I chose to work as a sweeper in a lithographic print shop near Paris.

Biodiversity parks in BU soon: VC	To increase biodiversity in the city, especially Bangalore University, the varsity syndicate has directed each department to create a bio-diversity park.Vice-Chancellor of Bangalore University K R Venugopal on Thursday said the syndicate has earmarked 50 acres to Botany department and 10 acres to each department to create bio-diversity parks.From 1974, when 1,111 acres were allocated to the University, only 500 acres now remain with it. So every department will have to take the responsibility to create the park and protect it, Venugopal said while speaking at the inauguration of a day-long workshop on “Traditional Knowledge as Intellectual Property Right- Documentation and Scope for Patent Protection,” organised by Karnataka Biodiversity Board (KBB) and Botany Department.The aim of the workshop was to interact with researchers, lecturers and students on the importance of biodiversity, research and patents.Faced with a shortage of trained lecturers and researchers, Venugopal said the pressure is now on students to work individually. He said the matter will be discussed with the education minister after the Belagavi Session ends.Chairman of the Department of Environmental Sciences R K Somashekar used the platform to call government organisations, including KBB, to help create and protect bio-diversity parks. He requested KBB to look at universities and researchers for work, instead of agencies, for their projects.Somashekar pointed that the problem with patenting traditional knowledge is that Indians are very slow when compared to other countries, like increase of turmeric and Basmati rice. This is despite the fact that 80% of medicines researched and sold are brain-child of Indian pharmaceutical companies and farmers.KBB member secretary Virender Singh said traditional knowledge is available since long but is highly misused. The Board is now interacting with communities to accumulate data and patent it.	Bangalore University,	 Dec 14 2018

Research scholars demand 80% increase in fellowship	The research scholars of the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, TIFR, Bangalore, who are protesting against the discrimination in the allocation of funds for PhD and postdoctoral scholars, have demanded an 80% hike on the current fellowship.The students who are protesting have appealed to the Department of Atomic Energy, HRD ministry, principal scientific advisors for initiation, increment and regularisation of fellowship for all research scholars.“During the last few years, public spending in higher education and in particular research in basic sciences and humanities have gradually declined, which is adversely resulting in high drop-out rates and increasing brain drain. This also affects India’s research ecosystem as well as scientific technologies,” students expressed their concerns by adding that 70% of the scholars in the country are severely discriminated, and the majority of them are not having a fellowship at all.In the letter, the research scholars have also explained the current pay scales at different government institutes and R&Ds. “The existing fellowships were last revised in October 2014 on a promise of periodic revisions every three to four years. As of date, neither the fellowship have been revised nor has been any such announcements made,” the letter added.By highlighting the loopholes, the research scholars have raised few demands, which mainly urges to fix the various problems arising while awarding the fellowship.All scholars must be entitled to dignified fellowship without any discrimination, which will be disbursed on a regular monthly basis, and to be revised on a yearly basis.The disparity of postdoctoral fellowship across institution must be eliminated and 80% increase in the amount, which is been currently awarded, fee reduction in different research institutes and universities, and provide adequate infrastructure and funding for research in humanities and basic science.

Sankey Tank track to be reinforced	At a time when most lakes in the city are in need of immediate attention, Sankey Tank, one of the very few well kept urban commons in the city, is all set to get a face-lift at a cost of Rs 4.5 crore.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is planning to introduce dedicated tracks for joggers and walkers on the three sides of the water-body. In the past few years, cracks have appeared on the existing track, and in some areas the track is sliding away, causing difficulty for the regulars.To arrest the sliding of the track, the civic body has planned to strengthen the tank bund by incorporating gabion boxes. The gabion box technology is used to strengthen bunds, and shores up well against erosion.“Three sides of the lake are used by walkers and joggers every day. In few areas, there are slides, which have damaged the walker’s track. Hence we have planned to repair,” Jagannath Rao, BBMP’s deputy conservator of forests told DH.“We will first place gabion boxes, upon which we will construct the walker’s path. The gabion boxes will avoid slides and erosion. We have taken up the work in the west bank of the lake already, and the work will start soon in the eastern and southern banks,” he added.Once the modern walker’s track is completed, a bridge connecting the east and west bank will be constructed. Sankey Tank was built in 1882 by the British officer Richard Sankey, to meet the water supply demands of the city. On an average, Sankey Tank attracts around 2,000 fitness enthusiasts daily.“The main reason for the damage on the pathway is constant water current and erosion over a period of time, which led to the weakening of the wall,” explained Jagannath Rao.

LGBTQ community continues to face discrimination	The Supreme Court may have repealed Section 377 and the state government may have introduced a transgender policy, but life for the LGBT community has not changed.Participants at Sunday’s Namma Pride march said they are rejected by citizens, and corporate and government officials.Over 3,000 people marched at the 11th edition of Namma Pride and Karnataka Queer Habba, organised by CSMR (Coalition for Sex Workers, Sexual & Sexuality Minorities’ Rights), Karnataka. “We go through a lot of harassment, the biggest of them is getting a gender certificate,” said Kumar, a member of Samara Society. “We have to undergo a series of tests at recognised government hospitals to get gender certificates. It’s very shameful. Many refuse to obtain a gender certificate because of the embarrassment, though it helps us get recognition.” An in-house census says of the 7,000 LGBTQs in the city, a meagre 250 have obtained gender certificates. Many working at government and private sectors refuse to come out due to social stigma, said Julian, a participant.“We are unable to get government jobs, rental accommodation or bank loans. After the court order, many private organisations have sacked their employees on learning about their identities,” Kumar added.‘I have no friends’Cosmetology student Riyana said people distance themselves once they come to know her real identity. “I have no friends in college,” she said. “It’s very difficult to continue my part-time job on many days. Even the police ill-treat us. The promise of awareness programmes to sensitise people hasn’t happened,” Riyana said.While the state conducts training programmes like tailoring and beautician courses through its departments, getting jobs or financial aid even from the government is impossible.The government has not yet called the association members to understand their demands and issues, said Yash, an organiser and participant.Their demands include full implementation of the SC verdict, sensitising the LGBTQIA community and the private sector, implementation of the Karnataka transgender policy, 2017 and review of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2016.

March organized in support of evicted migrant workers	Hundreds of Bengalureans from Mahadevapura marched in solidarity on Sunday, in support of the migrant workers who were evicted from slums in the area.Last week, the slum dwellers in Thubarahalli and Kundalahalli near Bellandur were forcefully evicted from their sheds at the behest of the local MLA, Arvind Limbavali. As the police stood guard, a small portion of the labour sheds at Munnekolala labour camp were razed. Thereafter, the homeless had to seek refuge in the neighbouring sheds, under the trees and out in the open.Most of the migrant workers are from different parts of Karnataka, including Hassan, Bidar and parts of north Karnataka. Some are from Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Citizens under the banner ‘Bengaluru for Thubarahalli and Kundalahalli’, took out the solidarity march.“The slum dwellers are the people that build our apartments, metros, roads; they have in fact built Bengaluru. They are the underprivileged who have left their villages and come here to earn a living. There are plenty of corporate staff in Bengaluru, why are we not kicking them out?” asked Vijayakumar Seethappa, a member of the Karnataka Janaarogya Chaluvali. “We are supporting the poor with humanity. We do not want to witness sectarian violence, and the city being divided,” Seethappa said. According to Seethappa, those who claim that illegal migrants live in our city’s slums have ‘vested interests’.“We had challenged the BBMP’s demolitions, and recently the stay order was given to restore the houses. We will stand by them and support them,” said Umesh, another supporter.	migrant workers,Bengaluru,	 Dec 10 2018
City docs reconstruct Yemeni war victim’s lower jaw	Seventeen-year-old Hussain, a war victim from Yemen had lost his lower jaw (mandible) in a bomb blast in his country. However, with the help of doctors from the city, his lower jaw was naturally reconstructed harvesting his bone and stem cells.Hussain could not close his mouth and had difficulty in swallowing due to lack of skeletal support. Despite undergoing multiple reconstructive surgeries and visiting various countries for the same, he finally found some relief at the Manipal Hospital in Malleswaram.Nisha Shetty, consultant Facio Maxillary surgeon at the hospital who treated Hussain said,” Hussain’s previous surgeries left very little opportunity for us. He had undergone grafting, both fibulaes (lower limbs) were used and multiple soft tissue grafts were harvested to perform surgeries; it was difficult to reconstruct his jaw again,” she added.After thorough planning, the doctors from Manipal Hospital used 3D scanning and printing to reconstruct the mandible. With the help of Hussain’s stem cells, hip bone (illium) and bone graft impregnated into a 3D printed model, a customised prefabricated mandible was fixed to his residual bone.Hussain was 17 when he lost his jawbone in a blast, and had undergone 9 surgeries across the globe. After 3 years, he visited Manipal hospital where his mandible was naturally reconstructed using his stem cells. Hussain had to wait for three months for his mandible to grow.

Now, go boating on Yediyur Lake	City residents and tourists alike can now enjoy the breathtaking vista around the 1,400-year-old Yediyur Lake in South Bengaluru, as the BBMP launches boating services on the famous waterbody.Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun on Saturday inaugurated the eco-friendly boat rides on the historic lake, which attracts several migratory birds during the winter. Yediyur becomes the second lake in the city after Madiwala to have boating services.For Rs 50, visitors will get half-an-hour of boating on the lake’s clear waters. To avoid noise that could disturb the winged visitors, the BBMP has banned motorised boats.“The noise of the motorboats can unsettle the migratory birds and the diesel spill could pollute the lake. So, we are only using the pedal boats,” said N R Ramesh, husband of corporator Poornima Ramesh.The corporator said a youth organisation — Kuvempu Yuvakara Sangha — bought the boats for Rs 12 lakh and is paying Rs 60,000 annual rent to the BBMP to operate the boats on the lake.Given the lake’s strong Hoysala connections, it is named after the famous queen of that dynasty Shantala Devi, who, as claimed by an inscription, bathed in its waters. All the eight boats in the lake have also been named after various Hoysala kings.Children below 15 are not allowed without adult supervision, while the use of plastic, smoking and consumption of alcohol are also banned near the waterbody.

IISc to conduct safety audit of labs in the premises	The Indian Institute of Science (IISC) management will be conducting the security audit of the other laboratories in the premises to tighten safety measures. Following the hydrogen blast that took place on Wednesday, the management of the IISC will be constituting an internal committee to investigate what caused the mishap.“The director will form an internal committee to investigate the cause of the mishap. There are some other areas in the campus where we have hydrogen and other cylinders for conducting experiments. The management will see how to boost the safety measures in these areas too,” a senior official from the IISC told DH.ALSO READ: FIR against two IISc Professors for Scholar’s deathThe incident claimed the life of a research scholar, and left three others severely injured, who are now undergoing treatment. According to police officials, the reason for the mishap will be known only after a proper investigation. Terming the incident as unfortunate, Chandrashekar, chief of IISC security said, “It’s not that we are lacking safety measures in the campus. There was nothing related to fire in the recent incident; it was a blast that happened inside a laboratory”.“In the past there have been several accidents involving fire at the IISC. But this is the first incident in the institution’s history that has claimed a life. We have a separate committee to ensure safety in the campus, and there is also a special officer to monitor the safety measures. We conduct regular audits. We have taken all precautions. Based on the report submitted by the internal committee we will check how to step-up safety measures in other departments. We will ensure this scenario never repeats.”	safety audit,IISc,cylinder explosion,	 Dec 07 2018

DD Roshini, an exclusive channel for students launched	"From now on, the students studying in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) schools will receive special lessons broadcast through an exclusive television channel — DD Roshini.Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy launched the new digital channel, a joint initiative of the state broadcaster, Doordarshan and the BBMP.This digital channel enables a two-way student-teacher interaction as programmes are broadcast through live-streaming with the help of satellites.BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said, “DD Roshini has designed programmes from nursery to college level. The programmes will be aired from 6 am to 10 pm.”He also said, until 5 pm, the channel will telecast programmes that will help students to prepare well for examinations. After 5 pm, a repeat of the day's programming will be shown so that it helps those who missed the day's shows.S G Raveendra, special commissioner, education, BBMP said, “As of now, this facility is available only in schools. We will eventually make these programmes available on tablets and regular television so that the students can watch them sitting in their homes. Once that is done, there will be no need to have internet access.”Raveendra also said that the British Council has been helping the BBMP to design the programmes. “Some of the tough subjects are being simplified by the experts at the British Council. If students need clarifications, they can seek expert-help through Skype calls or video conferences,” he said.The BBMP has plans to design elaborate programming for students at the SSLC and pre-university levels. Another 11 channels will be launched by April 2019, wherein a channel will be designated to each grade. ""The main focus of the project is to help students understand the syllabus easily,"" said a senior BBMP official."	H D Kumaraswamy,	 Dec 06 2018

Schools warn parents against PUBG online game	Schools in Bengaluru have begun to warn parents against children excessively playing the online game Player Unknown’s Battle Grounds (PUBG) after cases of addiction came to light.Shocked by the number of cases that are being referred to the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, several schools have asked parents to keep a tab on the number of hours their child spends playing the game.The Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Private Schools Karnataka (KAMS) will also issue advisory to parents asking them to restrict the number of hours students spend on the game.“We will ask our member schools to write to parents about this. We have, in the past, had discussions with the education department on imposing restricts on the number of hours a child spends playing such games. We want the police to also play an active role and take precautions to ensure measures are put in place to ensure children do not play such games,” KAMS stated.The game involves players fighting each other with weapons and the one who survives at the end is the winner. What begins as a game lasting about 30 minutes, keeps a player hooked on for several hours, leading to addiction, experts warn.Dr Manoj Kumar Sharma from the SHUT Clinic, Nimhans, said that five out of eight cases that are referred to them is related to PUBG addiction.“They are between the 16 to 20 age group. When we speak to them they explain that better graphics and interface is a reason they chose this game over the others,” Dr Sharma said.These students said that they have been playing the game for 10-12 hours. “This leads to disturbance in the morning schedule, has an impact on food habits, academic life is affected and withdrawal leads to aggression,” Dr Sharma said, while adding that whether PUBG as a game was leading to aggression is yet to be ascertained.“Schools should issue advisory to students about positive lifestyle. They must be cautioned against excessive gaming. Parents should check if kids are using it for too long,” Dr Sharma added.Meanwhile, Dr Bhujang Shetty, chairman, Narayana Nethralaya, said, “Staring into any electronic gadget for too long leaves children with a high risk of myopia.It could also cause stress to the eye. Hence there is a need to curb it,” Dr Shetty warned.	PUBG,Gaming addiction,	 Dec 06 2018
 Foreign language mandatory for BU management students	Management students at Bangalore University (BU) will have to study a foreign language from the upcoming academic year. Lack of basic foreign language skills has become the main concern during campus placements. The university’s board of studies, management courses, has decided to make at least one foreign language compulsory at the postgraduate level. “Many international recruiters have been demanding this skill of our students. As they are very particular about their native languages, English is the least preferred. So, in the career perspective of our students, it will be very helpful,” K Janardhanam, head, Canara Bank School of Management (CBSM), told DH. The university is yet to decide on the foreign languages, which will be mainly based on demand. To introduce one foreign language, they will need at least 10 management students. From the 2019-20 academic year, there will be a compulsory paper on Employability and Language Learning for first- and third-semester students studying PG management in BU. Janardhanam said: “Students will get four credits, which include assignments and 60-hour classes. The Centre for Global Languages on the Bangalore Central University (BCU) campus has sufficient staff, who will be roped into the programme. If not, we are planning on guest faculty. Students are free to select the foreign language of their choice, but it will be introduced only if 10 students enrol.” A senior official in BU said: “There is a demand for French, German, Spanish and Russian in general. The demand for the same in management course might vary. We are yet to design the course plan. We will consider all the stakeholders and design it. This will be surely implemented in the next academic year.”	Bangalore University,	 Dec 04 2018
Cancer surviour undergoes leadless pacemaker implant	"A 74-year-old woman, who is a cancer surviour, underwent the first leadless pacemaker implant in a city hospital recently. Unlike the traditional pacemaker, the leadless pacemaker was directly placed inside the patient's heart without surgery through the femoral vein. The woman, who also suffers from morbid obesity, had transient loss of consciousness (syncope) due to intermittent high grade electrical heart block.Explaining the procedure, Dr Shashidhar, Consultant Interventional Cardiologist and Electrophysiologist at Fortis Hospitals said that a traditional pacemaker could not be used as it was difficult in this case. ""The veins of upper arms where the traditional pacemakers are generally implanted were blocked due to the chemotherapy cycles, which the patient received for her breast cancer treatment in the past. Therefore, we used the leadless pacemaker for this patient,"" he said.“Compared to the traditional pacemaker which costs around Rs 1.5 lakh, the leadless pacemaker costs close to Rs 10 lakh. Moreover, this technology was introduced just 2 years ago. The patient withstood the procedure well and did not experience any unconsciousness post implant. In comparison to a conventional pacemaker, the new-age leadless pacemaker eliminates the need for a surgical pocket, there is no visible pacemaker device under a patient's chest skin, no incision scar on the chest, no connector wires or lead, and no restrictions on any daily activities.“ added Dr Shashidhar.Conventional pacemakers are surgically placed under the skin of the patient with the help of wires stretching from veins on the arms to the heart, which can further cause complications. Whereas in the leadless pacemaker, the patient does not experience any discomfort, infections, device complications or dysfunction. The conventional pacemakers weighs about 30 to 40 gm whereas the leadless pacemaker weighs only 2 gm with 0.8 cc volume. The battery life of the pacemaker is same as that of a conventional pacemaker which is around 7 to 8 years."	Cancer Patient,Pacemaker,	 Dec 04 2018
Biffes from Feb 7-14	The Bengaluru International Film Festival (Biffes) will be held from February 7 to 14, 2019, and the Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy has requested the government to frame rules to ensure the festival is held on the same dates every year. Academy chairman and filmmaker Nagathihalli Chandrashekhar confirmed the dates on the Biffes website. He said fixing a calendar will bring international accreditation to the festival and insulate it from political developments.“This is the 11th edition of the festival and it’s time it gets recognition among the global film fraternity. The accreditation will increase the variety of cinema and broaden the festival’s scope in the years to come. We have requested the government to pass an order in this regard,” he told DH but refused to reveal more details stating that it will be announced by the chief minister.Sources said about 250 movies may be screened during the festival and popular films may get as much time and space as the serious ones. Asked about the prominence of popular movies, Chandrashekhar said the festival will be balanced in its approach.“Both art cinema and popular movies will go hand in hand considering that the film industry supports these events. However, the emphasis is on aesthetics and there is no compromise. We have looked at the format of film festivals across the world. Besides the popular ones, there will be several movies in regional, national, Asian and international categories,” he said.No fest in MysuruChandrashekhar said the film festival will not be extended to Mysuru. “Many organisations from different towns have come, seeking to hold a film festival in their places as well. While I believe in taking movies to villages, Biffes is not the right event for that. Instead, we are trying to make the whole process as democratic as possible by involving all organisations and associations in Sandalwood,” he said.Asked about the budget of the festival, he said the chief minister’s office had told them not to waste money on grandeur. “There are several pressing issues like floods in Kodagu, drought in other parts of the state and farmers’ distress. We will make every effort to keep the budget at the lowest,” he said.	Bengaluru International Film Festival,	 Dec 04 2018
Wait a year to microchip and protect sandalwood trees	Save your sandalwood trees for another year. Perhaps, then you can purchase a microchip from the Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST), link it to your smart phone, and save your tree from any where in the world.After two years of research and development on inserting microchips on sandalwood trees, IWST and Hitachi India Private Limited are now correcting the anomalies before making the service available to public.Karnataka government had taken the lead in inserting microchips on sandalwood trees. The move was to protect the Sandalwood -- the state tree of Karnataka -- from illegal loggers. The microchips would also help maintain a sandalwood tree count. In October 2016, IWST and Hitachi had launched an e-Protection System for High Value Trees, along with an App. Though the list included sandalwood, red sander and rose wood trees, the focus was on sandalwood. A microchip is inserted in the tree bark which detects threats if any, and sends an alert to the owner’s mobile phone.As a sample, IWST and Hitachi installed microchips on 100 sandalwood trees of which 50 are in a private land in Nelamanagala, and the remaining in the IWST campus in Bengaluru.“After we installed the chips, we got to know the technical issues. They are now being corrected, and then the chip will be available for people to purchase and install,” IWST Director Surendra Kumar told DH.Initially, the hiccups were many. At times, the battery size was bigger than the tree-trunk. Also, the battery-life was just about 7 to 8 months and replacing it was a problem. The biggest hurdle was the sensitivity of the chip to natural wear and tear.	Sandalwood Trees,microchips,	 Dec 04 2018
Kadlekai Parishe begins, draws thousands	Roasted, dry, raw or boiled - it was groundnuts all the way in southern Bengaluru’s Basavanagudi on Monday.

Though the fair officially began on Monday and will go on until Wednesday, locals have been celebrating it for the past three days. But the fair isn’t just about groundnuts. There are hundreds of trinket shops selling everything from fashion accessories to toys. There are also eateries. As for Kadlekai, roasted groundnuts sold like hotcakes as they can be readily eaten. The opening-day crowd consisted mostly of college students. Plastic ban hits businessThe ban on the use of plastic led to a dip in sales compared with previous years, many vendors complained. Cheluvi, a vendor from Tamil Nadu, said she hiked the prices to Rs 35-40 per kilo as against the last year’s Rs 25-30 to give paper bags to customers. “Not everyone brings paper or cloth bags. So, we have to shell out on paper bags,” said Cheluvi, who has been setting up a stall at the fair for the past three years.

Traumatised cabbie prepares to leave city	"An Ola cab driver who was abducted, assaulted and robbed by four unidentified miscreants — who also forced his wife to strip on video call — is so traumatised by the incident that he has decided to return to his native in Andhra Pradesh.Shivakumar (name changed), 37, hails from Kadiri in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. He had come to the city 15 years ago and worked as a driver at call centres before moving to the cab aggregator five years ago.Speaking to DH, Shivakumar said it was the second time that he was assaulted on duty. Previously, he was beaten up by a passenger during night shift.Shivakumar lives with his wife and two children at a rented house in Doddathogur.Friday nightmareShivakumar was abducted from Adugodi on Friday night by a gang that had hailed his cab.He initially thought he would be released unharmed after he gave in to their demands of withdrawing money from ATMs. But, even after giving them Rs 30,000, the assailants asked him to make a video-call to his wife, who was then forced to strip. The gang took screenshots of the act.Later, Shivakumar was taken to a lodge in Channapatna. When the robbers realised that he didn’t have any money left, they threatened to upload his wife’s screenshots on social media. He was forced to call his brother-in-law who, in turn, transferred him money online.In the lodge, Shivakumar said he overheard the assailants plotting to kill him on way to Madikeri. He, however, escaped through the window of the washroom.‘Run to station’After he escaped around 7.05 am on Saturday, Shivakumar came across a police constable attached to Channapatna station near the lodge and informed him about the incident. But the policeman asked him to “run” to the station and inform them. After spending nearly 30 minutes at the police station, two constables came to the lodge with him on two bikes, by which time the assailants had fled.Shivakumar said the assailants were looking for ganja and liquor on Friday night, but in vain. “They told me that I was alive because there was no ganja or liquor. They would have killed me in an inebriated state. They also said they are not afraid of police complaints,” he said.All the four assailants were aged between 22 and 30, well-built and spoke in Kannada and English.There has been no arrest in the case yet. The Adugodi police have formed a team to nab the culprits.Ola yet to reach out to victimShivakumar said that it has been three days since the assault and two days since he filed a police complaint but Ola, the company which facilitated the assailants to book the cab, had not contacted him. He said that like thousands of drivers, he worked day and night for the company but none from the Ola team contacted him to extend any support.To a query, an Ola spokesperson insisted that the company was ""on top of the case""."

Authorities moot lake cess again	The Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority (KTCDA) and the Minor Irrigation Department (MID) are again pressing for the collection of lake cess from residential and commercial complexes around lakes.According to them, the idea is not new. The officials assert that districts and cities have already implemented the idea, and the same should be done in Bengaluru also.The Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority (KLCDA) first came up with the proposal a year ago. However, the government and the cabinet did not accept it then.Manjunath, KTCDA Commissioner, said the lake cess was collected in other places and Bengaluru should also adopt this. Collecting the lake cess is essential as it would help the departments in their functioning, and would also bring a sense of responsibility among people.Both the departments are now examining the plan in detail and are working to pressing it before the government once again.They hope the proposal to be accepted as the government has shown a lot of trust in both the departments.Quoting the example of Bellandur and Varthur lakes, where locals point fingers at government officials for not doing anything and also give suggestions, the officials say that the citizens should also help the government in improving the lakes.V Govindaraj, Deputy Secretary, Water Resources, MID said: when KLCDA was repelled, the government order clearly stated that all works and proposals undertaken by the KLCDA would continue. The MID, the monitoring agency and the custodians of the lakes, should take onus and work towards it.The authority had mooted the idea when Madiwala Lake was being made a Biodiversity Park. The idea gained momentum when it found that a lot of garbage and sewage was entering the lake.KLCDA officials had also stated that as people enjoy the scenic view of lakes and builders sell properties as lake view, they should divert a part of their profits under the corporate social responsibility (CSR).They also noted that as the residents of areas around Puttenahalli Lake in JP Nagar contribute money for the lake conservation, the same can be extended to other places also.A senior urban development department official said the idea could be relooked.If lake cess is collected from the people, then they will have a sense of accountability, and this would also help in engaging them for conservation.

Polluted Hebbagodi Lake gets a second chance at life	Strike out from your memory the image of Hebbagodi Lake covered with sludge, weeds and plastic waste. Today, the lake boasts clean water, a children’s park and an RO drinking water unit. Biocon Foundation, the CSR arm of Biocon and Syngene International Ltd, has bio-rejuvenated the 35-acre lake in southern Bengaluru, leading to an improvement in the water quality and the return of flora and fauna. The project was launched following approvals from the Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority (KLCDA) and other government bodies. Before that, the lake was largely covered with invasive weeds. Garbage and sludge had accumulated in it over the years, leading to a foul smell. The revival efforts began in 2016 with a feasibility study of remediation techniques for the lake’s revival.The next step was weeding the lake, composting the uprooted weeds and using the resultant green cover for landscaping around the lake. Several bar screens were then installed at the inlets to prevent fresh garbage from entering the lake. Thereafter, the 1.5-km lakebed was strengthened with native plants such as Vettiver (camel grass) to prevent soil erosion. The last step was fencing the lake. What’s bioremediation? Under bioremediation, the lake was dosed with a blend of enzymes and microorganisms to rapidly digest organic pollutants.Multiple energy-efficient cascading aerators and submersible mixers were installed in the lake to enhance the level of dissolved oxygen in the water.Floating wetlands were deployed for the continuous natural cleaning process. Getting labourers for the rejuvenation was a big challenge. As the lake is located in the middle of Hebbagodi, the narrow roads obstructed sand and material trucks. Workers encountered snakes in the lake.Sewage plant a mustThe lake, however, may get polluted again with the inflow of untreated sewage. Biocon Managing Director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said a sewage treatment plant needed to be installed at the lake or else the whole revival effort would go waste. “We are ready to set up the plant if the government permits it,” she said.“We chose Hebbagodi Lake to do our part to our community first. We will focus on Bommasandra and Kammasandra lakes in future.” The road to revival* Lake size: 31 acres and 39 guntas* Lake inlets: 5 sewage inlets and 2 stormwater inlets* Sewage inflow: 2 million litres per day*Total area of floating wetland: 12,000 square feet*Total volume of soil used for the bund: 67,000 cubic metres*Total volume of bio-enzymes dosed: 3,000 litres per day	lake restoration,Hebbagodi Lake,Lakes in Bengaluru,	 Dec 03 2018
700 families evicted from Bengaluru labour sheds	Around 700 migrant families living in labour sheds at East Bengaluru have been forcefully evicted at the urging of the Mahadevapura MLA.The families, consisting of women, children and infants, were staying in Devarabeesanahalli, Varthur, Kariyammana Agrahara, Munekolala and Bellandur.On the evening of November 30, a couple of earthmovers, with police presence, razed down a portion of the labour settlement at the Munekolala labour camp. Families occupying the shed rushed to take shelter at other nearby sheds occupied by friends and relatives to spend the night. The labourers were given time till Monday to move out.The labour sheds came up on vacant private lands surrounding the lake about 10 years ago when East Bengaluru was witnessing a real-estate boom.Sources said local politicians decided to remove the labourers as they blamed them for the rise in incidents of crime. The police said they did not receive communication from the BBMP, though local land owners and the BBMP should seek police security for such evictions.“Even if the communication had come from BBMP, we wouldn’t have had time to gather a large force to offer security,” a senior police official said.About 700 families occupy these sheds, including infants, children and women, numbering around 7,000. The sheds are fanned out across the city’s eastern parts.A majority of these migrants are from West Bengal and Odisha, while a good number have also arrived here through the porous Bangladeshi borders in search of work.Sources said politicians regarded the settlement as a vote bank, while local leaders help them get Aadhaar cards and voter identification during election time.Post the election, local leaders studied the voting pattern among the settlers and found that the majority from West Bengal and Odisha voted for the Congress as the grand old party pledged its alliance with (West Bengal Chief Minister) Mamata Banerjee. Barely a few illegal Bangladeshis voted for the BJP out of loyalty.Clearly unhappy, political leaders threw the migrants out of their shelters with a deadline to leave by Monday, sources said. Human rights activists and those working for economically weaker sections point out that the migrants have no other place to go. “There are infants and elderly people, too, among them,” said Khaleem Ullah, an activist with Movement for Justice. “They are evicted at a time when it is severely cold at night. Where’ll they find shelter?”	Labour sheds,Migrants,East Bengaluru,Evicted,	 Dec 03 2018
Tree census reveals rare species	"Members of a citizens' forum on Sunday held a tree census in Indiranagar by mapping their presence in each street.A 14-member team of students and residents, belonging to 'I Change Indiranagar' counted nearly 500 trees of different species in Defence Colony, Indiranagar.""The purpose is to be aware of the different species of trees planted several decades ago when the layout was formed,"" said Kannan A S, a member of the forum. ""Since there's no proper data of the trees, the census would document the trees in the neighbourhood, which will help residents save and protect them.""The team identified trees on every street, its location and health. They also recorded the tree's girth, height and species it belongs to, among other details.On the first day of the census, they found Avenue trees, Copper Pot trees, African Tulip, Rain trees and some of the rarest varieties like Arjuna tree and Sacred tree, also known as the Flame of the Forest.""After gathering data, if a tree requires immediate medical attention, the volunteers will immediately attend to it. For this project, we are taking the help of Gubbi Labs, a research organisation working towards sustainable ecosystems,"" Kannan explained.Tree walkTo acquaint local residents with the trees in their neighbourhood, 'I Change Indiranagar' is planning a 'Residents Tree Walk'.Kannan said: ""After the tree census, we intend to undertake a tree walk.

Women from slums trained to be cab drivers	When Sukanya lost her husband two years ago, the mother-of-two struggled to find the money to support her family and educate her sons.Having been trained as a driver, Sukanya now stands a chance to be hired by one of the city-based cab aggregators.“I’ve an identity now and can be a role model for several women,” Sukanya said.She was among 15 women in the city to get trained as drivers by Bengaluru-based NGO Action Aid and DXC Technology. In all, 60 women from Bengaluru and Jaipur hailing from low-income families have benefited from this training.Sumukha (name changed), who earned a living by sweeping streets, is also a recipient of the training, as are women who previously worked in garment factories and rolled agarbatis.“Our family depended on my husband’s income,” said Praveena, another woman trainee. “I had a fear that I wouldn’t be able to educate my children. This training has given me hope.”Malar, the programme manager with Action Aid, said the trainees will soon be recruited by cab aggregators. “The city has a very few women cab drivers. There’re several job opportunities for them and this will also help them earn more money,” she said, adding that cab aggregators Go ink and Taxshe will hire them.“Our primary objective is to provide an opportunity to women from deprived communities to explore alternative livelihood to lead a dignified life.

Indiranagar residents to map trees	Members of ‘I Change Indiranagar’, a citizens’ forum, plan to conduct a tree census in the area much before the civic body could take up such activity across the city.The residents will take up the drive during weekends, beginning from December 2.With an aim to bring in an accountability for the number of trees the locality houses, the project involves mapping of trees in each street.“Most of the trees that we see today were planted decades ago when the layout was formed. However, there is no account of the number of trees existing, and that which have been axed or fallen down. The census will collaborate all such data,” said Sneha Nandihal, president, BM Kaval Resident’s Welfare Association.“It all began after we witnessed incidents where a tree fell on a motorist, injuring several people, and also building owners appealing to the civic body to axe trees for construction purposes or to put up hoardings, where the Palike had indeed given permission to chop them,” recalls Sneha.The project would involve 10 volunteers, who will identify trees on every street, its location and assess the health. They will also record details such as the girth, height, locating the species and so on.After gathering data, if a tree requires immediate medical attention, the volunteers will help in fulfilling those needs.“We are taking the help of Gubbi Labs, a research organisation working towards sustainable ecosystems, for the project. Some students from a local college will also be involved,” said Kannan A S, another member of the forum.When asked why the residents are taking up the activity independently even though the civic body would soon take up the drive, Sneha said: “This is an independent activity we have been planning for a long time. We would be happy to share the information gathered with the civic body.”	tree census,Indiranagar,I Change Indiranagar,	 Nov 30 2018
Cubbon Park to have four times more bamboo trees	The horticulture department will plant four times the number of bamboo trees it removed in Cubbon Park, as the trees would improve the air quality and restore greenery in the Central Business District.The department is removing 200 bamboo stems and are replacing them with 400 trees in the first phase and has plans to plant 400 more saplings in phase 2. It hopes that the trees will be tall enough to give a greener look to the park by January.“Of over 300 species of bamboo, 12 that are suitable for Bengaluru will be planted at Cubbon Park. The entire plantation process would cost just Rs 1 lakh,” said Mahantesh Murgod, deputy director, horticulture department (Cubbon Park).Among the tree species chosen are those growing in the Western Ghats, Kerala and Assam.They include Bambusa bamboo, Indocalamus bamboo, Tulda bamboo, Dendrocala bamboo, Ochlandra bamboo and Myanmar (Burma) bamboo.Though the department had plans to plant other native trees, it finally settled on bamboo since city residents have fond memories of the tree. Besides, bamboo also grows faster and looks pleasing to the eyes.The department has also planned to create a system to grow bamboo and also educate people on several varieties of bamboo trees.Extensive survey Officials from the department and experts scoured several nurseries and institutes across the nation for the right kind of species that would suit Bengaluru’s conditions.While the saplings planted in the park are one to three metres tall, they would rapidly grow to 12 feet in a month’s time.Noted environmentalist and member of the horticulture department’s expert committee A N Yellappa Reddy said bamboo has been chosen over other kind of trees since it grows faster and uses little water.Bamboos have monocot roots, which, unlike the tap roots in the other trees, grow only up to a metre deep inside the earth and are ideal to be grown in the city centre.Reddy said the area needs bamboo since water evaporation from its trees are less compared to other tree varieties, while they also release a large amount of oxygen, which is much needed in the CBD area.Murgod said tree data will be collected in Cubbon Park after the exercise to digitise flora in the Lalbagh Botanical Garden ends.All trees, including the bamboo clusters, will be digitised. A tree census has already been completed in Cubbon Park and digitisation will be the next step.	Bamboo trees,Cubbon Park,Horticulture Department,	 Nov 30 2018

NIMHANS to host conference on Antibiotics resistance	"Take a good look at the antibiotics before popping it because there is a fair chance your system may resist it.The warning comes from microbiologists who would be part of the 42nd annual conference of Indian Association of Medical Microbiologists (MICROCON 2018) to be officially inaugurated on November 29 by Prof Vinod K Paul, Member, NITI Aayog.They say irrational use of antibiotics available over the counter has triggered an increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR).The conference will focus on spreading awareness over AMR, which is threatening to cause a health crises across the globe and touted as the next big pandemic wave to sweep the planet.Dr V Ravi, a professor at neurovirology department at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) said irrational use of antibiotics, self-medication, irresponsible purchase practices and shoddy use of antimicrobial in hospitals contribute to AMR.“There’s pressure to use the new high-end antibiotics hitting the market for different ailments. If a person develops resistance to one antibiotics, none of the other antibiotics would work. It’s a dangerous situation for patients,” Dr Ravi said.He said patients also become resistant to antibiotics as they consume meat or fish injected with the medicine. “Chicken, meat and eggs injected with antibiotics easily transmit the medicine to human and in some cases result in AMR,” he said.Dr R Ravi Kumar, who heads NIMHANS’ department of Neuromicrobiology, said antibiotics administered for gastro, urinary tract and respiratory infections are gradually developing resistance. “Patients don’t complete the course also cases AMR,” he added.WalkathonThe Microcon conference, the first ever, was launched on Thursday with a walkathon with a slogan ""Stop antimicrobial resistance""."

Diversity at the heart of Indian civilisation: Pranab	Former president Pranab Mukherjee on Tuesday stressed the need for cherishing and protecting the diversity of the Indian culture and civilisation and called for greater tolerance and acceptance of difference.Speaking as the chief guest at an event in St Joseph's Institute of Management, the president said India has emerged from darkness with great effort to become a country seeking donations from rich countries in the early decades after attaining freedom to becoming a donor.“However, there are aberrations. I feel pained and anguished when I look at the television and newspapers which capture the atrocities on innocents. Because we live in a land which preached the principle of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam 5000 years ago,” he said.Noting that diversity was at the heart of the largest functional democracy, he said lack of acceptance and respect towards diversity will make India an artificial unity.The former president also spoke about the rise of protectionism, which is affecting the declarations made by countries regarding world trade. One country may benefit from it (protectionism). But we should not accept such artificial barriers, which hurt many, he said.“Constitution has kept us together. A few months, we are going to have a general election where more than 900 million people will exercise their franchise to elect 543 members of Lok Sabha,” he said, calling upon the younger generation to find solutions to fix the aberrations.

BMRCL seeks $500M loan for airport metro	The airport metro project is set to gain momentum with the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) seeking a loan worth 500 million USD. The BMRCL will also request Rs 500 crore as aid from the Centre. The move comes after a proposal to raise funds through the User Development Fee (UDF) has been put off.Managing Director Ajay Seth said the corporation is looking for the $500 million, ideally in a long-term loan of up to 20 years with a moderate interest rate. The formal request for a loan has to go through the Union government. “We have held a discussion with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The request is yet to be sent to the Union government,” he said.The BMRCL is trying to shore up funds for the project after the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) in June blocked a proposal to raise Rs 1,000 crore through UDF. As per the AERA ruling, additional UDF can be levied after the metro services begin.The corporation will also seek Rs 500 crore from the Centre as per the new metro policy, where the Union government will provide 10% of the cost for a project, raising funds through innovative financing models.As per the financial plan approved by the cabinet, the state government is expected to pitch in Rs 1,250 crore, and the Centre, Rs 500 crore (8.40% of the project’s cost).The alignment of the metro line to the airport is likely to be revised with the BMRCL planning to connect the line at Hebbal instead of Nagavara.

Bengalureans help fight Cyclone Gaja blues	A group of Bengalureans are playing a vital role in facilitating relief efforts for those affected by Cyclone Gaja in Tamil Nadu.The Blue Umbrella is an initiative by a few like-minded individuals from the city to provide distress relief support in various parts of the country. The group anchors various initiatives to support social causes.The Blue Umbrella came together during the Chennai floods of 2015 where they mobilised close to 45 trucks of relief material, along with volunteers. The group raised funds, collected groceries, woolen, clothes, sanitary napkins, water and other essentials.What sets Blue Umbrella apart is the fact that it runs on WhatsApp -- an example of how social media can fuel change. The group has over 160 members who at the time of calamities pitch in by fundraising, collecting relief material and mobiising relief efforts on the ground.“We identify a local resource and coordinate the relief efforts. Many of our volunteers travel with trucks filled with relief material,” said Saravanan Arumugam, an entrepreneur and co-founder of The Blue Umbrella.Madhuri Kumar, a jewelry designer and co-founder of the group said, “The Blue Umbrella stands for protection and healing in times of distress as the colour blue is associated with healing.”“We also faced issues like intervention by some groups and agencies that hindered our efforts towards intensifying our reach. We plan to create a database of local resources, important contact centres and persons, government agencies and circulate them to facilitate immediate help to those affected during calamities,” said Arumugam.“Going forward our plan is to register The Blue Umbrella as a not-for-profit organisation focusing on facilitating disaster relief operations and other social causes ,” added Madhuri.

Lalbagh Botanical Garden all set to get a makeover	Bengaluru's premium lung-space, the Lalbagh Botanical Garden is all set to get a makeover. The botanical garden is getting ready for a butterfly park, a taxonomy garden and a fragrance garden where endangered flora and fauna, species endemic to the Western Ghats will thrive along with fruit-bearing trees that will attract birds.A master plan for the project prepared by the Horticulture Department will be implemented soon in the 25 acres set aside in the premises. “The empty land around Lalbagh Rock is been identified for this project, after consulting the naturalists and environmentalists,” said M Jagadeesh, Joint Director of Horticulture (Parks and Gardens).“The 240-acre botanical garden has close to 900 genera and 2,500 species of flora which may attract butterflies. We will rear butterflies in the laboratory and release into the park where their food source of around 400 plant species will be grown,” he added.The horticulture department had consulted the Kerala Forest Research Institute, which has constructed a similar garden in Nilambur. Two acres will be an open air butterfly park that will have shrubs, herbs, climbers and other trees.The project also includes a taxonomy garden and a fragrance garden -- a space with fruit-bearing trees and plant species that are endangered and are endemic to the Western Ghats that will lure birds that depend on specific plant species.“In two acres we will plant rare saplings from the western ghats, we have already started to collect the saplings,” explained M Jagadeesh.“Horticulture department will collect 125 endangered species and plant them in one acre. Around 175 different kinds of fruit-bearing tree species will be planted which will be a perennial habitat for birds in Lalbagh,” he added.The total cost of the project is estimated at around Rs 75 lakh. Presently, there are two butterfly parks in the city. The Butterfly park in the Bannerghatta Biological Park and the one at Doraisanipalya Jallary Reserve Forest, off Bannerghatta Road.

Dance of specially-abled kids transforms Cubbon Park	For a group of specially-abled children, Cubbon Park transforms into a stage every Sunday to display their talents. Matching their steps to the beats of Bhangra and Hip-hop, over 30 children and others with various disabilities dance alongside volunteers to promote inclusiveness.The dance sessions were started as part of an initiative by two brothers who plan to set up an inclusive dance school for the deaf and the visually impaired. Vishnu and Vishal Soman have also set up India’s only annual inclusive dance festival titled ‘Taandav’ for children and persons with disabilities which is being hosted in the city for the last five years. Vishnu, who has been a volunteer with Enable India, wanted to provide an inclusive platform for persons with disabilities to showcase their potential. This inspired him to set up Smileys India that brings together volunteers and persons with disabilities to showcase their talent through the medium of dance, art, culture and sports.Vishnu said, “When you dance, you set aside your ego and dance without inhibitions. It also helps in bringing people together through their love for dance and thus Taandav was born.”Vishal, a photographer, says that he was inspired by his brother.The Soman brothers found through the dance sessions that it also helped in boosting the confidence of the persons with disabilities to a large extent and also helped in improving their coordination skills.The ‘Attam Inclusive dance troupe’ which meets for practice in Cubbon Park comprises of volunteers with various disabilities who learn and practice various dance forms like Bhangra, Bollywood and Dappan Koothu, a folk dance from Tamil Nadu.The volunteer dance facilitators of Smileys India also conduct regular dance classes for the visually impaired and the deaf children at various non government organisations in the city.Vishnu said, “Taandav is the only dance festival in the country where people who cannot see, hear or speak learn and perform various dance forms,”The Taandav festival which is set to take place on December 16 aims at celebrating the spirit of dance with people from all walks of life.The participants include children from children homes, persons with hearing disabilities, visual impairment, limited mobility and those with cerebral palsy and autism who will dance alongside their facilitators and volunteers.

'Sport helps remove HIV stigma in children'	Involving children infected with HIV in sports is the best way to fight the stigma and discrimination attached to the disease, said Dr J V R Prasada, special envoy to the secretary general of the United Nations on HIV/AIDS.Speaking at an event organised to encourage HIV-affected children in sports here on Friday, Rao said: “The mission is to normalise the lives of children infected with HIV/AIDS. The children are not stereotyped as ‘sick’ but seen as one who can participate physically and mentally in sports and other daily activities.”“Government programmes should also have a strong component to involve these kids in sports activities as a part of their programmes, both at the Central and state government level,” he added.Marking the World Aids Day on December 1, Bangalore Schools Sports Foundation (BSSF) has organised the 10th edition of the “Champion In Me” sports meet.

Problems at Lalbagh for daily walkers and joggers	Home to several unique species of flora, the Lalbagh Botanical Gardens is one of the few lung spaces in the heart of the city. Thousands of people flock there every morning for their daily dose of fresh air to begin the day on a healthy note.Deccan Herald and Prajavani conducted a survey among a cross-section of walkers and joggers at Lalbagh last week, recognising their problems. In their reply, walkers listed their problems and sought immediate action.Of the 120-plus walkers and joggers interviewed, 94 complained about the garbage, especially whenever mega-events like flower show or training programmes are held. “Even on normal days, heaps of garbage including leftover eatables, carry bags and juice bottles are seen all over the park. Sometimes, dustbins are overflowing but the staff don’t clear them,” revealed Manjunath, a walker and a resident of N R Colony.Several senior citizens and women are worried about the lack of emergency medical facilities. In all, 61 people complained about the absence of emergency healthcare at the park.“At least during morning and evening hours, one ambulance must be stationed at each gate. Maybe an emergency centre with CPR facility will help,” opined Janardhan, a walker from Sudhamanagar. About 60% of the people complained about lack of potable water points.“The department has banned water bottles in the park. Many of the existing water points go dry in the morning and are unhygienic. Officials must set up water dispensing points wherever walkers sit or stop briefly,” Imran Pasha, a walker from Siddapur said.Walkers also complained about the lack of toilets, especially for women. “The existing toilets are in a remote corner. Sometimes, children and men urinate in the open. More security personnel need to be deployed to curb this problem,” Sudha, a walker from Wilson Garden said.Many joggers and walkers complained about pushcarts selling eatables spoiling the landscape.“The geological monument, where the Kempegowda tower is located, is littered with eatables and food wrappers. Vendors have illegally parked their carts on top of the hillock. Why haven’t the officials cleared them? Also, four and two-wheelers roam all over the park. If officials are permitted to travel, they must stick to a particular route,” Paras Jain, a jogger from VV Puram said.	Lalbagh,	 Nov 24 2018
Rain to continue for two more days, say weathermen	Rainfall is likely to continue in the city and other parts of south interior Karnataka for the next two days, said the weathermen on Friday.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials, the city is likely to receive light to moderate rainfall, while parts of coastal Karnataka are also expected to receive rain for the next two days.A trough in the easterlies from Comorin area to interior Tamil Nadu at 5.8 km above mean sea level has caused the rainfall. There is also a low trough at mean sea level over the southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Maldives and Lakshwadeep area extending up to 0.9 km above mean sea level.IMD Bengaluru Director in charge, C P Patil, said that under the influence of these systems the city, parts of the south interior and coastal Karnataka are experiencing rainfall. This will continue for another two to three days after which it will start to recede.On Friday the city received 3.8 mm rainfall up to 5.30 pm, while HAL and Kempegowda international airport received 7.6 mm and 2.2 mm rainfall respectively.There has been a drop in the maximum temperature and an increase in the minimum temperature because of the cloudy sky. The maximum temperature in the city at 5.30 pm was 25 degree Celsius and the minimum temperature was 19.6 degree Celsius. The maximum temperature was two degrees below normal and the minimum was 2.6 degrees above normal.	rains,Bengaluru,weather forecast,	 Nov 24 2018
Lung cancer turning into epidemic: Oncologists	Smoking is the single biggest cause for lung cancer. Exposure to passive smoking is no exception.People exposed to all kinds of emission --including vehicle exhaust and fumes emitted from industries --are at risk, said Dr Niti Raizada, Consultant Medical Oncologist and Hemato-oncologist, Vikram Hospital.She said, exposure to carcinogenic toxins like asbestos and radon; also radiation and air pollutants are other causes for lung cancer. Women's exposure to charcoal smoke (while cooking) was also a cause for lung cancer.“Only 15% of cases of lung cancer are curable at the time of diagnosis. Patients with lung cancer present themselves at a much later stage than other cancers, due to the nature of the disease. If lung cancer is detected by chest X-ray, it is already too late for the patient. The only effective method for screening lung cancer in early stages is the Low Dose Helical Lung CT, where high-resolution images pick up early lung lesions,” she added.Dr Suraj Manjunath, consultant Onco-surgeon at the hospital said “Lung cancer has one of the highest morbidity and mortality among all cancers. It accounts for 14.5% of all cancers in men and 8.4% in women globally. It is a leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide at 22%, which means that one in five of all cancer deaths in men occur due to lung cancer. Lung cancer accounts for 5.9% of all new cancer cases diagnosed in India (both sex combined), while mortality is 8.82% of all cancers combined.”November is 'lung cancer awareness month'. Doctors at the hospital stressed the need for early screening, avoiding cancer-causing environments, and quitting smoking.	lung cancer,smoking,	 Nov 23 2018
Bengaluru's traffic nightmares - the six culprits	November 19 was a nightmare for Bengaluru's commuters. Other than the fact that it was Monday morning, a farmers' protest march near Freedom Park created a dominoes' effect, sending the entire city traffic into a tizzy. The jams brought out the worst in several commuters (the stress might have evoked a fight or flight situation) which at some places worsened the jams. DH lists out six types of road-users who consciously or unconsciously (unfortunately) add to the city’s traffic snarls:1. Those who shift lanes with such flexibility that even a gymnast would be envious of them. Who said that they cannot take the right turn while being on the extreme left of the road? Does it create a traffic snarl? If so, too bad for others. Because nobody can stop them from taking that turn. Reminds me of a chicken crossing the road. 2. Dear chatters who park vehicles on the side of an already jammed road, because a phone call is more important than others reaching their destinations. We wonder if this has happened to them as well when they need to get to a destination, but someone is busy chatting on their phone ahead of them. Wake-up call! 3. Even worse are the road-users who talk on their phones while driving/riding/crossing roads. As they animatedly speak on their phones, they forget that there are other commuters. Maybe we could give them a call to let them know! 4. Direction blinkers are for dummies! 'We don't reveal our plans beforehand' said the driver who took a right turn out of the blue, sending the vehicles behind him to hit their brakes for dear life. 5. The two-wheelers who will just squeeze into a small space, because they can. Scratches on your vehicle, lane-shifting, troubled pedestrians, irate fellow commuters honking at them: nothing deters them. Life is a race, remember? And they are just trying to get ahead of you. 6. Empty autos who trail on the side of the roads because, customers! Whom they will refuse, anyway. But meanwhile, no traffic snarls will keep them from riding the way they want to. Cherry on top: people who park on busy streets with limited parking with such dexterity that even pedestrians find it hard to navigate their way onto the pavement. There might be several more subjects of traffic nightmares. If you think we have missed any, let us know in the comments below or tweet at us @deccanherald with #NoToTrafficJams and #ClearUpBengaluru. Till then, we wish you a happy commute.

BBMP to geotag dog pick-up vehicles	The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is planning to geotag dog pick-up vehicles in the city.The civic body wants to install a geo-positioning system (GPS) in the pick-up vehicles so that it can keep track of the relocation process after sterilisation surgery.The GPS will be monitored through a fleet management app which will allow officials to keep track of the vehicle. Speaking to DH, Randeep D, additional commissioner, (Admin), BBMP, said the measure was aimed at eliminating allegations of irregularities while dropping the dogs back.“There have been complaints that the dogs are not let back in their specific area after surgery, which leads to many problems. This is a measure to bring in more transparency in keeping track of the vehicles,” said Randeep.The BBMP has come under severe criticism from pet lovers, councillors and even Deputy Chief Minister and Bangalore Development Minister G Parameshwara on the rising cases of stray dog menace and botched surgeries under the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme.The civic body is now planning to track the trucks through GPS, along with the project to install microchip collar for dogs, which helps in identifying each dog. The chip will be linked to the software.“We can even go a step further and update information about every dog that has been treated, its area and so on on the BBMP website,” Randeep said.The installation of microchip as collars was first thought about by former mayor R Sampath Raj during his tenure. “We are still working on the cost and other processes,” said Randeep.BlacklistedThe BBMP also blacklisted two organisations for violating norms in birth control treatment. They are Sarvodaya Sevabhavi Samsthe and Animal Rights Fund (ARF).While Sarvodaya Sevabhavi Samsthe was accused of treating dogs with expired drugs, the ARF was charged with several cases of botched surgeries. “The ARF was involved in cost-cutting process. So it was noted that the quality has deteriorated during surgeries,” said Dr G Anand, joint director, animal husbandry, BBMP.He also said the payments to the two organisations have been frozen and that the issue has been handed over to the Animal Welfare Department.

Bystanders at high risk too	Going by those visiting hospitals seeking treatment for eye injuries, it has been noticed that bystanders observing fireworks are injured just as much as the participants. One such bystander was 55-year-old M N Gururaj, who suffered serious eye injuries. According to doctors at Minto Eye Hospital, Gururaj is likely to lose vision.According to data available at Minto hospital, over the past two days of the festivities, 26 people were treated for eye injuries, including three admissions. Six cases were reported on Thursday alone, the last day of the celebrations.At Nethradhama Eye Hospital, five people were treated for eye injuries.Narayana Nethralaya saw 32 cases of eye injuries being reported, one of which was serious. A 40-year-old man from Hegganahalli in northern Bengaluru severely damaged the cornea in his right eye when sparks from a flower pot cracker flew into his eyes. He underwent an amniotic corneal graft at the hospital.	Diwali,firecrackers,	 Nov 08 2018
13-year-old loses sight while bursting crackers	The festive celebrations for Diwali were marred by several unfortunate incidents of eye injuries and burns in the city this year. Thirteen-year-old Sadiha Banu received an eye injury in DJ Halli as she went to check a flower pot. It suddenly lit up and the sparks directly hit her right eye rupturing her eyeball. She was rushed to Minto Eye Hospital where she underwent a surgery.“Banu has undergone a surgery for an eye globe rupture. We have managed to restore the structural integrity of the eye, however, it is doubtful if the functional integrity would be restored,” said Dr B L Sujatha, medical director, Minto Eye Hospital.According to Dr Sujatha, about nine patients visited the hospital from Tuesday for eye injuries and most were bystanders.Monesh, a 7-year-old boy, was also admitted for eyeball rupture to Minto Hospital on Wednesday. Unlike Sadiha, Monesh was a bystander watching an atom bomb being lit. The cracker exploded near him and he suffered a corneal tear in the right eye and lower lid laceration. He too underwent a surgery at the hospital. Divya, another patient with an eye injury, was also admitted to the hospital. Besides Minto, a number of private eye hospitals reported eye injury cases. At Shankara Eye hospital, four people visited with eye injuries caused due to crackers. At Nethradhama Eye Hospital, six people arrived with eye injuries caused due to flower pots and rockets. Doctors from the hospital said that most of the injuries were skin and eye burns and they were treated as outpatients. Of the patients who visited, two were children and two others were bystanders.At Narayana Nethralaya, four patients with eye injuries were treated as outpatients. Three patients were also admitted to the burn ward at Victoria Hospital. Joseph, 27, was sleeping when the mat he was lying on caught fire because of a cracker. According to doctors, Joseph suffered severe burn injuries and will take time to recover. Two children also suffered burn injuries to the face and hands. They are also recuperating at the hospital.Read more:Youth sets off cracker in 3-year-old's mouth in UP	Diwali,firecrackers,	 Nov 07 2018
Shush! Noisy neighbourhoods outdo industrial areas	Noise pollution is turning out to be a threat as big as air pollution itself, if statistics are anything to go by.According to a recent analysis by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), noise pollution is more in residential areas and notified silent zones when compared to industrial areas.KSPCB member secretary Manoj Kumar said it was a matter of worry. He said decibel levels were high in residential areas because of the increasing commercial activities there and the mixed categories of zones.The regulations are more stringent in industrial areas, where there is more discipline in the movement of vehicles, parking and industry operations, which has ensured a check in noise pollution.But that is not the case in residential and commercial areas.In fact, the silent zones — around educational institutions, hospitals, courts and religious places — have become more noisy, said another senior KSPCB official.According to the Pollution Control Board data, noise pollution was 57.5% more in the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (Nimhans), which is a sensitive area, in the month of September.It was 19.3% high in Teri Office, Domlur, a residential area; 52% more in BTM layout, 17.1% more in SG Halli; 10.3% more on Church Street; 15% at Yeshwanthpur police station and within limits at Whitefield and Peenya Industrial area. These levels were recorded at night when traffic tends to be less.As per standards, noise pollution levels in residential areas should be 55 decibels, 65 in commercial areas, 50 in sensitive areas and 75 in industrial areas.Air pollution also highResidential areas presented a bleak picture on air pollution front, too. Manoj Kumar said while the situation was getting better in industrial areas, air pollution was increasing in residential and commercial areas.This is another indication of the impact that the increasing mixed zones have on the environment, calling for serious action by the government.	residential areas,noise pollution,Karnataka State Pollution Control Board,KSPCB,Air Pollution,industrial areas,	 Nov 06 2018
Citizens dump garbage on beautified black spots	Efforts by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike to beautify the black spots by drawing rangolis did not yield positive results as citizens continued to dump garbage. On the occasion of Kannada Rajyotsava, the civic body joined hands with The Ugly Indian and other volunteers to hold a rangoli festival with an aim to clear at least five black spots in each ward. It covered around 800 black spots.However, citizens were seen dumping garbage right where the pourakarmikas had drawn rangolis to stop people from littering.Pourakarmikas cleared garbage from the black spots identified with the help of junior health inspectors. Once the garbage was removed, the pourakarmikas and residents began drawing rangolis. BBMP officials took part in the festival along with members of ward committees and residents’ welfare associations.Speaking to DH, BBMP Additional Commissioner (Health) D Randeep said: “This initiative received good response from the public. We made sure the garbage dumped on the black spots is cleared within 48 hours.”“But some continued to dump garbage and littered the road. We engaged the marshals and penalised the offenders,” he added.The Ugly Indian group had trained the civic body officials and pourakarmikas to beautify the black spots.A volunteer from The Ugly Indian said: “Rangoli is a great way to prevent garbage dumping and wipe out the black spots. This (initiative) is creating awareness among people with support from the BBMP and their staff.”The volunteer said if people become aware that they should not litter the streets, it would be possible to reduce the garbage black spots to a great extent.

BBMP suspects avian flu for death of Common Coot	The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) suspects that the death of Common Coot, a variety of aquatic birds in Kasavanahalli Lake, is due to avian flu.According to P Jagannath Rao, the deputy conservator of forest, no deaths of birds were reported since Saturday.“Had the deaths continued, we would conduct the autopsy of the carcass to find the exact reason for the deaths,” he said.“I think the deaths happened due to some sort of avian flu. The fish in the lake are thriving. So we do not suspect a high volume of toxic pollutants entering the waterbody, or some deliberate attempt to poison the birds,” Rao added.On Friday, more than seven coots were found dead on the shore of Kasavanahalli Lake in Bellandur. There were several doubts over the cause of deaths. While a few locals claimed that the birds died because of the involvement of a fish contractor, who might have poisoned the birds, local lake protection group members claimed it could be due to avian flu or the cyanobacteria bloom in the lake.The residents of Kasavanahalli checked all the inlets and outlets of the lake and found that no sewage was let into the lake. The fishermen also said the water in the lake is good and that no fishes have died.Some non-government organisations and water scientists have sent the water samples of the lake to a lab for testing, the results of which will come on Tuesday.Asha Suresh, local corporator, said her team would conduct an inspection on Monday to check if there is any sewage leakage into the lake from the stormwater drain that runs parallel to the lake. “If the sewage is entering the lake, we will take immediate action,” she said.	avian flu,BBMP,Kasavanahalli lake,	 Nov 05 2018
Kidwai hospital to observe Cancer of Cervix awareness 	"Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology will be observing November as 'Cancer of Cervix awareness month'. The institute will also be conducting free screening with free pap smear and HPV tests. The institute will also organise medical education programme on November 24.Caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV), around 1 lakh cases are diagnosed every year in India with an age-adjusted rate of 18 per 1,00,000 population. In Karnataka alone, 5,000 new cases are identified each year. In Bengaluru, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among females with 850 cases being diagnosed every year. At Kidwai hospital, about 1,500 cases of cervical cancer are registered every year accounting to 24% of all female cancers.Dr C Ramachandra, director of the institute said that most patients are diagnosed at a later stage which makes it difficult for their survival. ""There is a general lack of awareness and organised screening for cervical cancer in India,"" he added."	Cancer,Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology,	 Nov 03 2018
Bengalureans fill potholes on their own, set example	As BBMP rushes to meet the high court’s deadline to fill potholes in the city, there are some Bengalureans who have taken it upon themselves to ensure motorable roads.One such person is Dr Sunil Kumar Hebbi who has filled over 20 potholes on Sarjapur Road in the past few months. A small accident on the way to work inspired him to take action with the help of his friends.Hebbi told DH, “A few months back, I had a minor accident wherein the bumper of my car came off owing to the big jerk caused by a pothole. I ended up spending Rs 4,000 to get it repaired. The money that I spent for repairs could have been used to repair a pothole to help others and thus I started doing that.”Hebbi, along with his friends, meets once a week to fill potholes. During the course of the week, they identify potholes to be filled. Following this, they spend two hours over a weekend and fill them using the materials they are able to source.“It only takes a few dedicated minutes to fix a pothole. One can fill a pothole using gravel, sand and cement,” he adds. In another initiative, Prashanth Maruru, an employee at an engineering college started a pothole challenge after fixing a pothole near his house. He shared his story on social media and tagged his friends to follow suit.“I drive a two-wheeler and have faced the perils of potholes in the city. Potholes are one of the major reasons for accidents in the city,” says Maruru.Maruru adds, “It does not take much to fill a pothole. Using simple available material like gravel, sand an cement, one can fill a pothole. It did not cost me much to fill a pothole. Imagine if everyone takes up this task, the city’s roads will soon be pothole-free.”It is not just residents, but even companies have included pothole filling as part of their CSR initiatives wherein they have joined hands with ‘Pothole Raja’ (Prathap Bhimasena Rao) to fill potholes near their premises.	pothole filling,	 Nov 03 2018
Manyata residents fear traffic due to Sunny's event	Manyata Tech park residents are a harried lot with the police granting permission for Fusion Night, an event where Sunny Leone will be performing at the White Orchid convention centre on Saturday.The residents say that the white topping work has already affected traffic and events like these only increase their inconvenience and spoil their area's serenity.Even though the residential locality has an alternative back entry, the major approach road is through the road where the work for white topping is currently going on, the residents say.“It takes an hour to cover a short distance between Hebbal and Manyata flyover because of the white topping work. This program will bring hundreds of people which will cause a huge nuisance in the area. How did the police permit this?” asked a resident.White Orchid and the Manpho Convention Hall in Manyata Tech park host events through the week. To manage traffic movement in and around Manyata tech park, the employees of the IT firms have been issued traffic advisories drafted by Manyata management.“The last Sunday morning, commuters were stuck in traffic for two hours because of programs at White Orchid and Manpho Convention hall,” said another resident. An Abacus examination and an intercollegiate function where a Telugu actor was invited threw traffic out of gear recently, he added.The North division traffic police said that they have been instructed to supervise and monitor traffic movement and keep it moving all the time. “The traffic police would enforce smooth traffic flow. Even if it is slow-moving, our job is to keep it flowing as the developmental work continues,” said Sarah Fatima, DCP North Division (Traffic).Moreover, the traffic police cannot interfere with permissions for an event. It is the law and order police who gives permission to organisers and provides security for an event. The permission had been granted a month back after taking into consideration factors like the weekend when IT employees have an off. Moreover, only over a 1000 tickets have been issued for the closed event, said a senior police officer.However, sources from the residential locality said that despite their requests that programs like these do not get conducted until the white topping work is completed, a minister pressurised the police to grant permission.

Forums talk muck in politics while garbage litters lawn	"This weekend at the Bangalore Literature Festival, speakers and panellists spoke about corruption and ways to tackle the muck within Indian politics. Bengalureans, however, noticed the litter on the lawns of Hotel Lalit Ashok where the fest was organised.It was the most awaited literary event of the year. The who’s who of the literary fraternity and crowds had gathered to engage in intelligent and thought-provoking discussions, but basic etiquette seemed to be missing from the festival.The majority of visitors seemed to ignore the dustbins available every few feet and chose to leave used paper plates and cups on tables or on sides of walkways.“It is an irony,"" said Sonal Kumari, an artist and a ‘budding environmentalist’ (as she calls herself). ""This is supposed to be a hub of well-read, educated people who visit here to enhance their knowledge or contribute to the conversations. Yet, they seemed to have forgotten the very basics of cultured behaviour.” She pointed out how the lesson ‘throw waste in a bin’ is taught to toddlers, but grownups are the ones who often ignore it.“I guess walking a few steps in heels and fancy shoes was a bit too much work for the people here,"" said Kavya, a student. ""I wonder if they were expecting volunteers to walk around with garbage bags to collect the trash like they do in aeroplanes.”At the end of the day, the organisers did create a wonderful platform for engaging dialogues and conversations on burning issues. If only the visitors had played their part."	garbage problem,Bangalore Literature Festival,Clean Bengaluru,	 Oct 29 2018
Now, Bengaluru NGO begins #MenToo campaign	"The #MeToo movement has gathered pace over the past few weeks with a rising number of women speaking out on sexual harassment and support for them has been pouring in from various quarters. Now, men have started raising voices asking fellow men to come out and speak out about instances of sexual harassment that they have faced at the hands of women.A Bengaluru-based NGO has come up with '#MenToo' in order to highlight ""The oppression suffered by men in contemporary times."" It is being described as a mutually incompatible version of the powerful movement to call out male sexual predators in the positions of power.The event came under the spotlight after almost 15 people gathered at Cubbon Park on Saturday to launch a protest inspired by ‘#MeToo’. The organising committee was the Children’s Rights Initiative for Shared Parenting’ (CRISP), which is based on the chief objective of recognising the serious effects of ‘Parental Alienation ‘on children due to single-parent families on account of divorce and separation. One of the prominent faces of the protest was Pascal Mazurier, a former French Diplomat, who was accused of sexually assaulting his own daughter in 2014. Pascal laid importance to the protection of men as well.National President of CRISP, Kumar V Jahgirdar informed The News Minute that the #MeToo movement is an attempt to disrepute men who have worked hard to earn respect in the society. ""If a woman has a case of sexual harassment to report, she should take it up with the police and take the legal route instead of 'naming and shaming' which the people generally tend to do. Splashing it across the social media sites is a complete ‘fruitless attempt',"" he added."	#MeToo,MeToo,CRISP,	 Oct 24 2018
Unsafe in BMTC bus? raise 'Durga' alarm	In order to make public transportation safer for women, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has signed a deal with Dare to Understand behaviour, Respond appropriately and Guard ourselves Ably (DURGA) to install panic buttons in case of emergency.The initiative was done to safeguard women or children, who are travelling in buses against any sort of physical harassment, and the alarms are called 'Durga'.The user can alert the staff and passengers on the bus, through the trigger of these buttons. Pictorial representations displayed helps people who are illiterate as well to raise an alarm. Switches placed on either side of the bus are at a convenient height, where even kids can reach out in case of emergency. The sound is loud enough that even people outside the bus can hear it.As soon as the alarm is triggered, a buzzer beeps for 20 seconds. The driver is expected to stop the bus and check the issue and only after resolving it can her turn off the switch. In case of the switch not being turned off, the buzzer continues to beep every ten seconds. In addition to the sound, it also turns on the flashlights installed both inside and outside the bus, to attract the attention of people commuting on the road.

VIDEO: Tired citizens dance to tunes of bad footpaths	"Garbage issues, traffic snarls, potholes and missing footpaths - the issues haunting the city are many and Bengalureans have always found novel ways to deal with them.The latest one is a video of people putting their best feet forward to highlight the pathetic state of footpaths and the lack of them. The video was widely liked and shared on social media after it was uploaded on Oct. 16.The video - 'Bharatnatya Saaku, #FootPathBeku' - created by members of an informal citizens' group, Malleshwaram Social, is sarcastic, funny and nicely drives home the message. It begins with two women on a road missing a footpath that's covered with construction debris. Dejected, they decide to wear their ghungroos, summon musicians and begin a 'dance' to discover a path to tread. ""We try to highlight such issues that affect the residents directly or directly,"" said Dhanush N, a 27-year-old techie and member of Malleshwaram Social. ""Malleswaram is a locality with the majority of senior citizens who need proper infrastructure, especially the footpaths. Six of us began the footpath awareness initiative almost four months back. We decided to add fun and sarcasm to our videos to reach a wider audience and create an impact."" Dhanush is a part of a 10-member team that came up with the #FootPathBeku video. The group organises talks, vocational training, and recently created a children's library in Malleswaram. They are trying to create a bridge between the authorities and the residents for a better neighbourhood. ""The way forward to a better footpath or infrastructure is cooperation between the residents and the authorities,"" Dhanush said. ""Citizens should be willing to accommodate for better roads and footpaths while the authorities need to understand our needs."" This initiative is one of a number of creative ways that citizens have adopted to protest for a better Bengaluru. Baadal Nanjundaswamy, a 'pothole artist,' paints canvases portraying broken roads and potholes to get the attention of authorities. Baadal then goes to the roads and sets up sculptures, live installations and paintings there. In 2015, his sculpture of a crocodile at the site of an actual pothole made the BBMP fix it in no time, reported The Hindu. It also earned Baadal the title of crocodile artist. Similarly, The Ugly Indians group protests by fixing ugly spots around the city. The Ugly Indians are mostly professionals in the 25 to 40 age group who remain anonymous. They respond to media queries only by email. Their mission is to ""spot-fix"" Bangalore, dirty street by dirty street. Their work has inspired the 'Ugliness Challenge' in other cities, according to the BBC. Malleswaram Social, the new kid on the block, has managed to quickly make waves. The group hopes that the unique initiative and online campaign will create awareness among citizens and convince them to play an active part in infrastructure improvements. The #FoothPathBeku video is the first of many videos that the group has planned in the coming days. They will be tackling other civic issues as well. The next question is whether citizens and authorities will make some moves of their own for better footpaths."	Footpath,Malleswaram,Bengaluru,	 Oct 17 2018

'Unplanned growth will make Bengaluru a dead city'	Lakes will soon become seasonal waterbodies as unplanned and unbridled development, coupled with reduced green cover, will turn Bengaluru a dead city, IISc professor T V Ramachandra warned on Friday.Delivering a talk on ‘Lessons of Unplanned Urbanisation: Bengaluru (A dying city with burning and frothing lakes)’, Ramachandra presented the findings from the Centre of Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to make his case.According to the study, the city’s urban cover will spread over 98.5% of the area by 2025 leaving a dismal amount of greenery which will not be able to provide for oxygen for all.“The day is not far when people have to pack an oxygen bottle for their child along with food and water bottle. But people highlighting this are still receiving death threats from those destroying the environment,” he said.Also Read | It's time to get building green and affordableHealth issuesRamachandra said the effect of the bad environment was already visible in society as health issues have soared.“Earlier, only one in 1 lakh people suffered a kidney failure. But now it has come to one in 500 people. Children are suffering from bone marrow cancer. What else do we need to understand the importance of protecting our surroundings,” he asked.Ramachandra opined that the Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority should not have been repealed. “The lakes have been handed over to the minor irrigation department which will not do anything,” he said.Also Read | Green cover shrinks as urbanisation takes toll on BengaluruHe said the government has strong legislative backing in Wetlands Rules 2010 but their implementation remains poor.“Pumping unprocessed sewage water and dumping garbage into lakes goes on unchecked. Destruction of lakes will continue till people correct their own behaviour,” he said.Prof Ramachandra, who had warned in 2016 that Bengaluru would be unliveable in five years, has been an outspoken critic of the nature of Bengaluru's growth and development. He has called out the lack of political will and public participation to ensure that India's Silicon Valley doesn't become unsustainble or unliveable in the near future.Know about sustainable living | It's time to go green in Bengaluru	environment,IISc,Bengaluru,unplanned growth,urbanisation,	 Oct 13 2018

Book fest to attract vernacular readers	Hosting the event after a hiatus of two years, the Bengaluru Book Festival has set its eyes on vernacular languages and aims to attract people from other states by showcasing publications from their native tongue.Considering the humongous migrant population belonging to various states, the festival will not only showcase vernacular publications but also have a section of e-books and multimedia and literary games section to beckon GenNext readers.Starting from October 15 at the Palace Grounds, the festival will go on till October 21. Unlike the previous editions, this years’ festival will focus predominantly on regional languages besides featuring a separate section on academics, including overseas publications.According to B S Raghuram, programme director of the Bangalore Book Festival, more than 200 publications will take part in the festival in association with several other literary publications. “The theme and concept of this years’ festival is that ‘If you want intellectual stimulus, come with children’ so that the young generation is also introduced to the culture of reading. When kids are being bowled over by mobile and tablet screens, we are attempting to introduce them to the joy of reading,” Raghuram said.According to the organisers about two lakh people will visit the festival. The week-long fest is likely to bring about Rs 10-crore business to the publishers. “There will be a publisher from every corner of the country. We have got publishers from all the prominent vernacular languages as Bengaluru has a huge population of people from other states. Besides, there will be learning and vocabulary enhancing games and material for kids. Religious publications will also be part of the festival, catering to senior citizens.”This apart, several prominent writers from other languages are likely to take part in the book-reading events or discussions organised by the publishers.As part of the festival, there will be 15% discount on books by all publishers. “Over and above this festival discount, there will discount offered by publishers (up to 50%) at selected stalls,” Raghuram said.	book fair,Bengaluru,	 Oct 12 2018

Dasara Dolls tell a story of tradition	A quiet corner in the ground floor of Anupama Hoskere’s house in Banashankari 2nd Stage has turned into a shrine of tradition. As part of Dasara festivities, she has decorated it with over 10,000 dolls.This year she has themed her arrangement as ‘Srinivasa Kalyana’ - depicting that hardships, kindness, responsibility, and compassion are all an integral part of life.Her dolls ranging from 3 inches to 30 feet include various Dasara dolls, goddess Gauri idols, dolls depicting scenes from Mahabharata, Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita.The specialty of this year’s arrangement is the presence of western dolls and South Indian Miniature Brass (utensils and dolls made out of brass).“Every doll in my arrangement is a depiction of a story and a tradition. Many people including children are not aware of the history of the time when brass was predominantly used. I have kept over 30 types of miniature utensils that will attract children,” said Hoskere, Director, Dhaatu Puppet Theater. Some of the dolls are made by Anupama herself. “I have made more than 600 wooden dolls which are also a part of the present doll arrangement,” she said.Symbol of beauty“Not many are interested in arranging dolls for Dasara. Some do not have enough space in their homes or the time to arrange the dolls. But many are interested at least to witness them as every doll is a symbol of beauty and tradition speaking to the viewer through a story,” said Anupama.The exhibition of dolls will be on till November 3 with several puppet shows and performances.She added, “The doll manufacturing culture in the state is depleting. If that is considered prime, then it will give rise to a lot of artists and jobs.”	Mysuru,Dasara,Dasara Dolls,	 Oct 12 2018
Tour to Nimhansto remove stigma on mental health	For the first time in the history of the institute, psychiatrists at National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) have planned a guided tour for the public to remove the stigma attached to mental illness.With many people asking questions, like ‘Do all patients, who go for mental illness treatment, get a shock treatment?’, the psychiatrists have decided to throw open the Institute’s doors for visitors for a day. Department of Mental Health Education, NIMHANS, will be organising ‘Stories against Stigma’ on October 27 where visitors can register for Rs 100 and take a tour of the institute. Based on the response the pilot project receives, more such tours will be conducted once in two months.“It will be open to the public to propagate de-stigmatsation of ‘lunatic asylums’. Furthermore, by this association, we aim to make people feel more comfortable in seeking help for mental health problems as we introduce different perspectives of looking at the stigma attached to mental health,” said Dr K S Meena, Associate Professor, Department of Mental Health Education.Though the public will not be allowed access inside the wards which house patients for treatment, a glimpse of it can be taken. The heritage building and psychiatric wards would be shown to patients.“There is a wrong perception of shock treatment as part of mental health treatment. We call it Electroconvulsive therapy in medical terms. It does not happen as depicted in movies. Neither are the patients as violent as people believe them to be,” said Dr Meena.YogaNIMHANS has developed modules integrating yoga with mental health and research. Besides, for those with mental retardation, bakery classes, computer training is also conducted. The tour will also give access to these areas.	NIMHANS,	 Oct 12 2018
Lalbagh: Female guards to check unruly morning walkers	For the first time, the Horticulture Department has deployed women security guards in a bid to control unruly morning walkers and to ensure cleanliness within the Lalbagh Botanical Garden. These guards will check that walkers they do not carry plastic bags and eatables inside the lung space. They will also keep a watch out for misbehaviour. “While most of the morning walkers coming to Labagh are genuine, there are many miscreants also. We observed for a month and assessed the crowd before deploying women. Initially, we were very reluctant to deploy women staffers. We were worried about the gender disparity and their safety. But we found that it worked,” a senior Horticulture Department told DH.The official said the women stand at Lalbagh main gate and the west gate from 6 am to 7 am. For added safety, male guards and CCTV cameras are also deployed.“We found that many bring biscuits, millets, grains and other food items in plastic carry bags. They feed animals and birds and litter the place. We also found that some people enter the Garden as morning walkers and enjoy free tours and even indulge in illegal activities. When male guards would question, they would be abused and even physically assaulted. But with females, people have started to behave and some have even stopped coming inside,” the official added.This has created a mixed response among walkers. While some are happy with the idea, some say that this is just a method to harass people.“What is the need to deploy additional security, that too woman. We have been coming for years together. Does the department not trust us? This will only create more chaos,” said Shivangi, a morning walker.However P Sadashiva Reddy, President of Lalbagh Morning Walkers Association, said that this was a welcome move. “In fact, we will help them (women guards). This has helped control the menace to some extent,” he said.	CCTV,Lalbagh Botanical Garden,morning walk,	 Oct 11 2018

Three doctors among those infected with H1N1 flu	"About three doctors treating patients with Influenza A (H1N1) have been tested positive for the flu in three different hospitals in Bengaluru.The doctors may have contracted the infection from the patients who had severe symptoms of influenza.One of the doctors from a government hospital said he came to work with a severe cold and by the end of the day developed a high fever and was unable to carry on with his work.His colleague suggested him to send his swab samples for testing, which returned positive for H1N1 flu.“I had seen a few patients in the out-patient department and knew that some had the severe form of flu. After my swab results came out, I realised how I got the infection,"" the doctor said.""It is a first-hand experience for me to go through the symptoms of the infection I am treating. The infection besides having the severe form of fever and cold also had myalgia. It has been a week, and even now I have mild myalgia and cough. The symptoms are sometimes unbearable,” the doctor added.Two other doctors from government hospitals have also been tested positive for H1N1 flu. Among the two, one of the doctors had co-morbid conditions and was hospitalised for a few days.Dr C Nagaraja, Director of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), said though H1N1 flu is a contagious infection, it can still be prevented.""One of the ways of contracting infection is if a person inhales the droplets of an infected person. One will not contract the infection by walking into an H1N1 flu ward, however certain basic preventive measures like washing hands and maintaining hygiene can help curb the spread of the infection,"" he added."	doctors,H1N1 cases,Bengaluru,H1N1 flu,	 Oct 10 2018

Cop suffers eye injury after cracker hits him	A careless bursting of firecrackers during a Ganesha procession in northern Bengaluru’s RT Nagar on Monday left a police officer with a severe eye injury. Narayanappa, an assistant sub-inspector posted at the RT Nagar police station, had stopped by when the procession passed along RT Nagar Main Road. He suffered a severe damage to the retina on his right eye. A local youth association had organised the Ganesha procession near the RT Nagar post office although the police hadn’t given permission for setting up a Ganesha idol, a source in the RT Nagar police station told DH. Local youths burst firecrackers on the busy road as part of the procession. Narayanappa rushed to the spot and stood by. A burning firecracker hit him in the right eye. His colleagues rushed him to the Narayana Nethralaya on West of Chord Road.A doctor said the policeman suffered a thermal injury on the retina. “As the eye has become opaque due to the burn, we have allowed it to heal. We are yet to assess any damage to the optical nerve as he was hit by a blunt object,” a senior retina specialist said. Police have detained two people who had organised the procession.	firecrackers,Bengaluru,Cop,	 Oct 10 2018

City celebrates the ‘Joy of Giving’ week	"Recently a group of hearing-impaired children joined hands with volunteers of a city-based organisation that launched 'TraffiKnights' — an event to raise awareness about traffic in the city.The programme was part of a host of initiatives organised to celebrate 'Daan Utsav', also called the 'Joy of Giving' — a week-long programme that ended on Monday.

Dengue cases have come down: Officials	The confirmed dengue cases in the city have come down, and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) attributes this to the public awareness regarding the disease.The civic body had earmarked Rs 8 crore for mosquito-control in its Budget for 2018-19. It has reduced the fogging exercise as the cases are coming down.According to the BBMP officials, the number of dengue cases has drastically come down.“When compared to the last year, where there were 7,291 confirmed dengue cases reported, this year only 861 cases were reported,” said, Manoranjan Hegde, chief health officer, BBMP.“We carry out fogging in areas where the mosquito density is more. We receive complaints especially from the outskirts of the city. We are fogging wherever we get complaints,” he added.The officials also said his year they got more complaints from Kempapura, Mediwala and East zone.Dr Shivakumar, project coordinator in Public Health Information and Epidemiological Cell (PHIEC) of BBMP said, “the main reason for the decrease in the dengue case is the increased public awareness about the disease and also by keeping the surrounding area clean.”However, the BBMP data shows that the East Zone continues to report more dengue cases. Around 365 cases have been confirmed from this zone from January to September this year.The residents of Indiranagar, Bellandur and Mahadevapura also complain about the mosquito menace.Nalini Harish, a resident of Bellandur, said the garbage mismanagement by the civic authority is the reason for the growing mosquito menace in the area.“The garbage is not cleared and when it rains the mosquitoes start breeding in these black spots,” Nalini added.Sumukhi Deshpande, a resident of Indiranagar, said, “stagnant sewage water in our vicinity is drawing mosquitoes. Despite several complaints, the civic body has not taken action to curb the mosquito menace.”	dengue cases,	 Oct 09 2018

Reported at DH event, this mess is gone now	After a resident complained about seized vehicles turning into a garbage dump at Sanjaynagar at the ‘DH Citizen for Civic Amenities’ event held on Saturday, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara tweeted on Monday that action has been taken with regard to the dumping black spot.At the event, a senior citizen had brought the matter to the notice of the minister who also holds the city development portfolio.“More than six vehicles seized by the Sanjaynagar police are parked on the roadside for the last two years in Ward Number 19, becoming a garbage dumping spot.The authorities have not taken any action,” the resident had complained to Parameshwara.Parameshwara, who had noted down the issue, tweeted on Monday, “At @DeccanHerald’s event on garbage management, I was informed about seized vehicles becoming a garbage dump in Sanjaynagar by a resident.The area has been cleared.

Poor internet connectivity makes it tough for students 	The students of Bangalore North University (BNU) and its affiliated colleges have raised their displeasure with the university’s demand to upload their details to web portals. As most of the affiliated colleges are situated in rural areas they are plagued with poor internet connectivity and shortage of computers in the colleges. “This should be done by the colleges and the university. Instead, they are putting the burden on us. They are aware that rural students lack such facilities, yet they are insisting that we do it for ourself. The internet connectivity is very poor and it takes at least half an hour to upload the details,” said a student of a college affiliated to BNU.The students are a worried lot as the last date to upload the details is on October 10. They are forced to visit cyber cafes in the nearby towns, not only missing their classes but also paying a hefty sum.“The owners demand Rs 150 – 200 to upload each student’s details. It has become a huge burden for students from economically weak sections. Even colleges have a scarcity of computer systems and internet,” the student added.Dr T D Kemparaju, vice-chancellor, BNU told DH, “This move was intended to have all the stakeholders collectively participate. There were instances, where the student would notice an error in the marks card after receiving it. Then he/she would have to run pillar to post to get it corrected. With the new process, the student can enter his/her accurate details and also get the acknowledgement for the same. It is easier to spot where things go wrong.”In the latest process, the students’ details will go through three levels. The first level is with the students, the second with the college and the third at the university. When asked about the time constraints, the VC said, “We are more likely to extend the deadline. Since this is for the benefit of the students we will take a decision accordingly.”	students,BNU,	 Oct 08 2018
‘SC rulings welcome, but life isn’t rosy yet for women'	The Supreme Court’s recent striking down of some patriarchial practices is welcome, but that doesn’t really change the situation on the ground unless people become inclusive, according to activists. Anindya Hajra, of Pratyay Gender Trust, said scrapping Section 377 of the IPC does not end the current complications that transgenders face. “A child still has to face bullying in school for his/her sexual behavioural changes. Nothing can be done unless society fully accepts us,” she said at a panel discussion on ‘We The Women’ here on Sunday. She continued: “Schools should admit transgender children along with specially-abled ones, offering educational opportunities to all. The government should quickly enact the Rights of Transgender Persons Bill.” Masooma Ranalvi, a leading activist against female genital mutilation (FGM), said the impact of the age-old practice was not a temporary occurrence but a permanent bugbear. FGM entails the cutting of a part of a woman’s genitalia to curb premarital sexual desires. “It has a lot of negative effect on the sex life of women once they get married. It was at the age of seven that I fell victim to it and it took me 40 years to realise and understand what had happened to me,” she said. Ranalvi said after genital mutilation, a woman’s close relationships, even with her mother or grandmother, do not remain the same. “My grandmother was the reason for my genital mutilation, but by the time I understood the practice, she was no more.”	LGBT,Supreme Court,Section 377,	 Oct 08 2018
Lake at Hosakerehalli now turns into a dumping yard	Hosakerehalli Lake, where a historic ‘mantapa’ was discovered during desilting last year, has now become a garbage dump yard.“The water body is now stinking. Most of our neighbours are suffering from breathing related diseases as it is impossible to get fresh air in the air. Tenants are also vacating their houses as the situation gets worse when it rains,” said Eerappa, a resident of Hosakerehalli village.In 2015, Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had taken up the rejuvenation of the lake and begun cleaning operations. The lake regained its beauty and soon resembled a bird sanctuary with many migratory birds flocking to it. But the civic body’s negligence has made all the hard work go in vain.A resident on condition of anonymity said the lake has turned into a dumpyard within six months. “We are scared that the lake will overflow after heavy rains and enter the residential areas. The civic body has failed to check the encroachment of the lake bed,” he said.Shivappa, a villager, said, “We have lodged several complaints with civic bodies. Officials are just negligent towards this. We have been keeping an eye out on the lake, but people dump waste at night. As common people how much more can we do?”For the rejuvenation of the lake, spread over 59 acres, Rs 9.40 crore was sanctioned. BDA officials said 40% of the rejuvenation project has been completed and they have approximately spent Rs 1.80 crore till date.“One acre twenty guntas of the lake area has been encroached by the residents. After the tahasildar finishes the marking process, we are going to fence the lake area. Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is taking up the pipe laying project to divert the sewage water. Once it’s done, the water body will be fit to store rain water,” Sumathi, Assistant Executive Engineer told DH.When asked about the deadline for the completion of the project, the official said, “We are going to complete it by March 2019. However, it depends on the rain, which might delay the project.”	Hosakerehalli Lake,	 Oct 07 2018
Study centres on Buddha, Vivekananda & Ambedkar in BU	The study centres on Buddha, Swamy Vivekananda and Dr B R Ambedkar will shortly come up on the Bangalore University’s Jnana Bharathi campus.Recently, the varsity was in news for getting zero admission for the Gandhian Studies, established in 1969.Admitting the failure of the centre in attracting students, Venugopal K R, the vice-chancellor, had said that they would introduce Gandhian studies as a compulsory subject in open electives. This he hoped would help the centre survive, and make the Gandhian philosophy alive among the present generation.“The decision was taken in the syndicate meeting. The aim of establishing the new centres is to make the current generation aware of the values and the preachings of the great personalities,” BU VC told DH.“For now Jindal group has agreed to provide the necessary financial support for the projects. We need books and study materials, and we will have to approach other companies also. The university will provide the necessary land for the centres,” the vice-chancellor said.“Maha Bodhi Society in Bengaluru had demanded the study centre on Buddha. As the Dalai Lama Institute for Higher Education is already affiliated to our varsity, we can expect the students to be part of the Gautama Buddha study centre. We will also make this as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), where this will reach many students,” the vice-chancellor added.The syndicate also plans to make one MOOC course on any of the four personalities compulsory for the student to clear the degree course.“The decision regarding this should be reviewed in the next syndicate meeting. Along with revamping of Gandhian studies, we intend to set up the centres by the December, where students can join by the next academic year,” the VC added.	Swamy Vivekananda,	 Oct 07 2018
3 districts to be free from open defecation	The state government is all set to declare three districts open defecation-free in the state. Work is on to ensure that sufficient toilets are built in four more districts to qualify them for the tag. Principal Secretary of the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) L K Ateeq announced this at a workshop in the city on Friday.RDPR Commissioner Dr Vishal R said works in Chitradurga, Kalaburagi and Tumakuru districts have been completed.“The declaration will come after verification, which is under progress,” he said. As many as 80,000 toilets are yet to be built in four districts of Bidar, Vijayapura, Belagavi and Raichur. On Wednesday, Yadgir district was declared open-defecation free. To bag the “Open Defecation-free,” tag, no fecal matter should be visible and it should be treated effectively, said Dr Vishal.As per the estimate of 2011 socio-economic survey, five lakh more beneficiaries have been added.“We have written to the central government seeking funds for this. They will give us Rs 7,200 per toilet and the state will invest a certain sum for the construction work. It is implemented in 60:40 ration where the Centre bears the larger expense,” he said.RDPR Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said even enough toilets were being constructed, there was a need to bring behavioural changes among people.“We must ensure that the main intention of the Swachch Bharat Abhiyan or any other campaigns directed towards the purpose is not forgotten,” he said. He sought to know why the government was still being held responsible when toilets were built and the people did not use them.“There is a need to inculcate a change in the mindset of the people. Within a month, we will reach the target of toilet constructions.There is a need to reach out to rural masses through internet. It is only inappropriate to think that they are not technologically advanced. With most of country having an access to the internet, messages on hygiene can be spread through social media,” he said.Complaints across the state are common that though toilets are built, they have been rendered unusable due to lack of water supply and poor maintenance, Krishna Byre Gowda added.

Rider dies as bike skids on slippery Shanthinagar road	A 25-year-old software engineer died and his colleague was wounded after their speeding bike skidded in central Bengaluru's Shanthinagar on Friday night, police said. Local residents suggested that the accident occurred because of the bad road which had become slippery following heavy rainfall. They accused the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) of not acting on their complaints about the road's bad condition. Mohammed Azharuddin, a resident of Lakkasandra and a native of Madurai, was riding the motorbike with his colleague Raghu Vishnu, 26, on the pillion. The duo worked for a company on Richmond Road. The vehicle belongs to Vishnu and they were on the way to the Shanthinagar bus station where Azharuddin had to be dropped off. Azharuddin requested Vishnu to let him ride. The road was wet and slippery, and the motorbike went into a skid. Azharuddin fell off the bike, and its handle brushed against his chest. He sustained internal injuries and bled profusely. He was rushed to a hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. Vishnu escaped with leg injuries. In a statement to the jurisdictional Wilson Garden traffic police, he praised the alacrity showed by the driver of a KSRTC driver that was right behind their motorbike. He applied sudden brakes.

School refrains mother from meeting child	"A mother of a pre-kg student, studying in a private school, has lodged a police complaint against the school management for refraining her from meeting her son during a school event.""My son kept crying throughout. On examination, we found that he was injured by the stapler pins on a wristband, which the school had provided him. He was looking for me to help him remove the band. No one had attended to him,"" she said.Students participating in the Independence Day celebrations were asked to gather in their classrooms prior to the performance on August 15. The mother, who has sought anonymity, said that she was not allowed to meet her child despite requests.""Why should children be held back in the classroom for so long, especially when it is a holiday and the other students are performing?"" she questioned. She said that none of the teachers had taken note of the injury until she pointed it out.Speaking about the incident, Susheela S, Director, Vishwa Vidyapeeth International School, said, the school had apologised to the parent for the staple pin injury.""It is tough for us to manage so many children at once. It is to facilitate convenience that these children were made into batches and asked to sit in their classrooms while the other students were performing,"" she said.She claimed that the parent of the child had threatened to take necessary action if the school did not respond to her. She also sought to know why the parent had lodged a complaint several months after the incident. ""The child has also been taken out of school. We are only hopeful that incidents like these do not affect the child's education,"" said Susheela.PhotographsYet another aspect mentioned in the complaint lodged with Makkala Sahayavani on October 1 is that the mother's photographs were taken without consent. The complainant has said that during a meeting with the school in subsequent weeks, her photographs were clicked.""I asked them to show me the pictures but I was told that the photographer had left the venue. It was after this incident that I lost confidence and stopped sending my son to the school,"" she said. The school authorities said that during the 'Mother on duty' event, photographs of participants who speak in the discussion are taken and the best speaker is awarded on Women's day. ""Only group pictures were taken during the event. We told her that she could check them herself in the school,"" said Susheela."	child,mother,school,	 Oct 05 2018
BBMP drills borewell in middle of new road	Days after being rapped by the high court over the poor maintenance of roads, the BBMP has chosen to dig a borewell right in the middle of a road, ostensibly to provide water to “the residents” in the area.Thursday morning brought a shocker to residents of Vinayak Nagar of Ward 113 in HAL limits when a borewell truck began drilling in the middle of the road.Anxious residents who took the pain to know the reason for this destruction were told to ‘shut up’ by the local corporator.“We were wondering as to who would permit to dig a borewell on a newly laid road. Some residents reached out to the corporator expressing their concern only to be told that it was in the interest of the residents in the area,” a resident on condition of anonymity told DH.Another resident said if the BBMP was taking up a project for the benefit of the public, at least some of the residents should have been consulted.“There is no issue with water supply in the area, and we never asked for a public borewell. If the BBMP wanted to serve us, they should have at least asked us about it,” the resident said.The residents demanded to know whether it was in line with the rules to sanction drilling of a borewell in the middle of the road.“The very idea of such a project is absurd. It not only obstructs traffic but causes inconvenience to all road users,” he rued.‘BJP workers oppose’However, the project took an interesting political turn when DH spoke to corporator M Chandrappa Reddy.He said those opposing the borewell were not the residents, but supporters of the BJP.“It was close to one and a half months since the locality got water and we drilled the borewell to supply water to the residents. We have taken permission from BBMP officials,” said Reddy. “We are testing if we could get water here. Once the borewell work is done, we will cover the place with cement,” he added.Meanwhile, Prasanna, assistant executive engineer, also said that the permission was granted to dig the borewell.“This place was chosen because if we go too near to the house, the foundation would be affected,” he said.“We have dug up to six to eight inches. It will not harm the road as we will restore it. We have also taken the help of geologists to find the best spot to locate water,” Prasanna added.	BBMP,borewell,	 Oct 05 2018
Bus driver gets involved in road rage,students stranded	Around 40 students, on their way home from school, were stranded inside their school bus for over an hour in Kadubisanahalli after their driver got involved in a road rage incident on Wednesday. According to the police, the incident occurred around 12.30 pm near the New Horizon Gurukul School when the bus brushed against an auto-rickshaw on the busy Outer Ring Road behind New Horizon College of Engineering.The school bus driver, Suresh K (35), alleged that there was busy traffic on the road and the auto-rickshaw driver, Praveen Kumar (33), picked up a quarrel with him for not moving the bus front. He then opened the bus driver’s door and pulling him down started beating him up with a cane, Suresh told DH.Meanwhile, the school students along with a woman attendant Uma Rani started to panic. Four supervisors from the school rushed to Suresh’s help, but Praveen was adamant that the bus along with the students stay there until the police come.When the bus went to an apartment nearby, the auto-driver followed it and stopped it inside the apartment premise. Eventually, the school had to arrange for another bus and a driver to ferry the students home. Praveen Kumar alleged that it was the bus driver’s mistake as he brushed against his vehicle and he was using the children as an excuse to escape from the spot. Suresh said that parents were worried and were calling the attendant to inquire about their children. The Marathahalli police have registered complaints from both the parties and registered two FIRs against each of them. They are investigating further.	School Children,Road Rage,	 Oct 04 2018

He lay on the bench of the medical hospital writhing in pain. It was then that he told me that I should take up the cause. That pushed me to take up a medical degree,"" he said.This year the Association received as many as 30 applications. and five NGOs made it to the top in the screening process.Speaking on the occasion, former Karnataka Lokayukta Justice Santosh Hegde said that working as the Lokayukta was an eye opener for him and he saw a lack of humanism in most places he worked.He said that the definition of democracy as ""for the people, of the people and by the people"" does not remain valid here. Otherwise public interests would have been taken care of. ""If it was so, then the government would have offered all that the NGOs are doing now,"" he said."

Wayanad Calling rally	The people of Kerala have learnt their lesson from irresponsible and unregulated tourism, said K R Vanchishwar, President of Wayanad Tourism Organisation (WTO) on Thursday. Speaking to the media, he said that to ensure the state does not witness another devastation like the Kerala floods, WTO and the state tourism department are now imposing stricter regulations on hotels, resorts and other stakeholders. Construction of high rises has been banned and buildings have been limited only to two floors.An audit report of every site and destination needs to be conducted. The government and other stakeholders are also identifying new destinations for mass tourism. A regulation has also been put in place for wildlife tourism and safari jeeps.While saying that Wayanad district was not badly affected by the floods, he said that it still brought a drop of 60-70% in tourism footfall. In the last three to four months Wayanad alone has faced a financial loss of around Rs 10-15 crore. Tourism is the biggest revenue generator for Kerala and Wayanad.To once again invite tourists to the hilly district, they have organised a ‘Wayanad Calling’ Rally on October 6. Starting from The Lalit at 6 am, the rally will culminate at Wayanad passing through Mysuru Road and Bandipur Tiger Reserve. The rally will comprise 40 superbikes and 25 jeeps. There is also room for spot registration. He asserted that there will be no compromise on the safety of tourists.	travel,Wayanad,Kerala,	 Oct 04 2018

Ayodha photo exhibition highlights communal harmony	A photo exhibition at Rangoli Metro art gallery highlighted one of the values that the Mahatma stood for all his life: communal harmony. ‘Hey Ayodhya’, featured pictures from renowned photographer Sudhir Shetty’s visit to the land of Rama, explored the Babri Masjid-Ram Temple dispute from the perspective of people’s history.“All my misconceptions about Ayodhya and the dispute were washed away when I met the litigant in the Babri Masjid case, Iqbal Ansari, who was chatting with the priest of a nearby Ram Mandir. Throughout Ayodhya, there is a communal harmony. But the focus on the dispute has left the economy in shambles,” Shetty said.The photographs show Ram bhakts singing ‘qawwali’ and a video features Hindus organising the ‘iftar’ for Muslims, who form only six percent of the local population. “Both Hindus and Muslims in the area are angry with the politicians who rake up the issue every election. They are demanding that governance and development should be the first priority,” Shetty said.Shetty said 800 other Ram Mandirs and several ponds “where Rama is said to have dipped his hands or feet” are in decrepit condition. “I thought people should see through this. If my exhibition encourages them to visit Ayodhya and witness the reality, I will think of it as a success,” he said.The exhibition was one of the major draws among other events, live drawing and painting, public art installation and recital of Gandhi's favourite songs, organised at the Boulevard on Tuesday.

Prajna Yoga helps children develop intuition	Vishal, a Class 5 student, finds playing tennis a cakewalk now. After learning ‘Prajna Yoga’ through the Art of Living (AoL) Foundation he can clearly sense his opponent’s moves.“Tennis is my favourite game. After learning Prajna yoga, I am able to sense my opponent’s moves and my body automatically moves towards the ball,” said Vishal, who was among the 30 children who performed the yoga technique at the Art of Living Foundation in Kanakapura Road on Tuesday.A yoga technique devised by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, it helps children to develop high levels of intuition to enable them to predict, draw and guess despite being blindfolded. “My daughter is a very talented horse rider but she would get extremely nervous. She lacked faith in her capabilities. Within 3 months of Prajna Yoga, she has won four medals at the national level,” said Alka Tej Singh, a parent from Rajasthan. Divya Kanchibhotla, education scientist, Sri Sri Institute for Advanced Research said, “The AoL’s Prajna Yoga is taught to kids between 5 and 18 years of age. This yogic meditation technique enables children to access, cultivate and retain their inherent intuitive capacity.”She added, “Their parents and teachers can observe a positive behavioural change in them. After learning this technique, many blind students have stopped using Braille. They read through obvious sensation. This yoga technique also helps autistic kids to improve their concentration.”	Yoga,Art of Living,	 Oct 02 2018
Youth find it fashionable to lose temper, says Sri Sri	Violence free society, inhibition free intellect, trauma free memory and sorrow free soul are the birthrights of every human, said Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Tuesday. The spiritual leader and founder of the Art of Living said that people should see beyond their prejudice to end violence.While speaking at the ‘World Summit on Countering Violence’ he expressed concern about today’s youth turning aggressive at little matters. “Losing their temper has become a fashion among the youngsters recently. This is due to the influence of films and media. If they don’t have the strength to tackle a problem, they turn aggressive and that finally leads to depression,” he said.Over 30 delegates from across the world participated in the summit organized at Art of Living International Center in Bengaluru. The conference began with emphasizing the power of inner peace that helps sustain non-violence in the world. Experts shared their perspectives on the complexities and nuances of creating a non-violent world. They discussed issues from religious dogma to repression causing strife and shared personal stories of how witnessing violence led to a resolve to make a difference. “In my 35 years as a police officer, I have seen terrorism and separatism of all shades. Corruption is the common thread that runs through most of the problems leading to bad governance. This in turn leads to discrimination and exploitation causing frustration and anger,” said Prakash Singh, former DIG, Uttar Pradesh police. As part of Mahatma Gandhi’s 149th birth anniversary, they also discussed approaches to solve modern day conflicts through Gandhian principles of non-violence.

Gandhi Jayanti: Residents to take up garbage cleaning	"Residents of Hoodi ward in Mahadevapura have decided to mark this Gandhi Jayanthi in a unique way.Implementing Gandhiji's principle of being the change they want, the residents would hold an awareness-cum-cleaning drive in the ward to remove mounds of garbage lying about in the area.Piling garbage has been a major problem in the ward, with the BBMP virtually turning its back on the issue.Waste segregation centres have popped up along the roadside, much to the chagrin of those living in apartment complexes and individual houses. Parents of school-goers are concerned about their health.The secondary segregation of garbage is being done on the roadside since the BBMP has not designated a space for the task.By holding the cleaning drive at all roadside segregation points, the residents of Hoodi will channelise their anger against the BBMP's apathy in a positive way.""These segregation points are closer to our apartment. Hundreds of schoolchildren waiting outside for their buses bear the stench. The odour spreads up to 100 metres,"" said Manjunath B, who resides in an apartment.He said a segregation point has come up very close to a government school in Hoodi. ""I see children from the school clamping their fingers to their noses while passing through the garbage point to their school,"" he said.The residents' association here has written to newly elected Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun about the issue. They say she has assured swift action.BBMP health inspector Seshagiri said a decision on the garbage issue will be made after consultations with the mayor."	garbage problem,Hoodi,BBMP,Gandhi Jayanti,	 Oct 01 2018

As city grows, BBMP stares at piles of crises	The tech capital of India has a population of about 12 million now which is expected to surge to 20 million by 2031. Will the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) be able to manage solid waste with this growing capacity? That remains the biggest concern for the residents of the city.“According to statistics projected by the draft of Revised Master Plan-2031 prepared by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), the population of the city is expected to reach 20 million,” said BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad.At present, the city generates close to 5,700 metric tonnes of waste, out of which close to 4,200 metric tonnes is wet waste and about 1,200 is dry waste.With the growing population and according to projections by the BDA, the amount of garbage is expected to be more than double of today’s capacities.Close to 13,911 metric tonnes of garbage will be generated by 2031, as nearby villages will also be included in city limits.Plans galore, but...Though the BBMP has an excellent plan to collect and process waste, it has failed to implement it, said solid waste management expert Sandhya Narayan, who is also a member of the Solid Waste Management Round Table.“The BBMP has several plans, including the microplan, dry waste collection, and waste processing plants that process garbage at ward levels. But none of them is being implemented. It has to be looked into why they are not able to implement them,” she said.Manjunath Prasad said, “We have studied that the city will have a population of close to 20 million. The projections are done by considering both the core and outer areas. We are trying to strengthen the process of collection and transportation of garbage in the city. We are setting up transfer stations across the city which will bring in mechanised process in the entire exercise. We are also looking at establishing dry waste collection centres in all wards.”The transfer station will also compress the waste once collected and reduce the capacity to half, as most of the wet waste consists of moisture, he said.He also cited several reasons why the civic body is failing to enforce solid waste management rules. “There is a lot of resistance some time as the contractor lobby is very strong. For instance, they want to run the dry waste collection centres and take over the autos that go for dry waste collection. We are trying our best to root out this, and the abolition of contract system for pourakarmikas is one such example,” he said.	Solid Waste Management,BBMP,Garbage crisis,	 Oct 01 2018
Kolar student wages lone battle to save her school	"This class V student of the government primary school at Obenahalli in Srinivaspur taluk of the district is forced to live a lonely school life.Nanditha is the only student in the school which has a single teacher. When the teacher is sent on training, a teacher from one of the nearby schools is deputed there. The third person in the school is the mid-day meal cook. But Nanditha has none to give her company during the lunch time except the teacher.The student wrote about her unique plight to Speaker Ramesh Kumar, the MLA from Srinivaspur, and former minister Suresh Kumar, representing Rajajinagar, Bengaluru in the Assembly. She has urged them that her school should be like any other, where scores of students study, play and share ideas and feelings.Suresh Kumar visited the school recently to see for himself Nanditha's plight. The girl read out a English poem for him: ""Elephant is big, elephant is grey...""Later, in a Facebook post, Suresh Kumar said the girl was actually a student of the government school at Hebbata and was transferred to the Obenahalli school as it had reached the zero-student status and was on the verge of closure.The MLA says there are other schools in the taluk which have two and three students and face the threat of closure. He feels experts and the government must think of ways so that no other child faces a lonely life in school, which should be a place to play with boys and girls in the same age group and exchange ideas.Now, it is a struggle out there for the girl and the teacher at the Obenahalli school to save it from the threat of closure."

Cardiologists adopt alternatives to blood thinners	Amarendra was worried about his father’s health. Suffering from heart disease, his father was on anticoagulants to aid in blood thinning.However, he had a tendency to fall often resulting in severe bleeding. “We came across devices that could replace these blood thinner tablets. They have worked well for him and he is doing much better than before,” he said. The octogenarian does not have to take the tablets after he was inserted with a fairly new medical innovation, Watchman LAA (Left atrial appendage) occlusion device. Cardiologists in the city have adopted the occlusion device and the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug to replace oral anticoagulants for patients suffering from Atrial fibrillation. These prevent the chances of developing stroke, especially among senior citizens having symptoms of Atrial fibrillation.The device is inserted through the groin until it reaches the right atrium. A small hole is made through the septum till it reaches the left atrium where the left atrial appendage (a small pouch) is closed using the device.Dr Ranjan Shetty, HOD and Consultant Cardiologist, Manipal Hospitals, said, “Oral anticoagulants are normally prescribed for those suffering from atrial fibrillation (irregular rapid heart rate that increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications). But its dosage needs to be constantly monitored. Even a slight increase in the dosage, especially among senior citizens, raises the chances of bleeding from any part of the body.They sometimes lose their balance and tend to fall, also causing bleeding. These devices are safe in comparison.”	Cardiologists,World Heart Day,	 Sep 30 2018

Baig sees rival's hand, demands CBI probe	"Senior Congress leader and Shivajinagar MLA, R Roshan Baig, claimed on Wednesday that his adversaries dragged him into the IMA cheating case in order to defame him. In a series of tweets, Baig said a politician who had been trying to emerge as the face of the Muslim community had been spreading rumours among the aggrieved investors against him and demanded that Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy order a CBI probe into the case. He did not name the politician. ""After my recent political fallouts, some of my adversaries have made a full-fledged attempt at assassinating my character by orchestrating a series of events using underhanded methods. The entire hitjob has been carried out using a baseless, un-investigated audio recording,"" he tweeted. Another tweet read: ""I was informed that a good chunk of people seen at the protests outside IMA Jewels were mobilised to mix in with the people who were actually aggrieved to intensify the situation, by a politician who has been trying very hard to become the ""face of the community."" Baig had recently slammed the Congress legislature party leader Siddaramaiah and KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao for neglecting Muslims. One of his main grouses was that the Congress leadership had been giving prominence to Chamarajpet MLA, B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan, who is currently the Minister for Minorities Welfare and Food and Civil Supplies.

7 directors held, kingpin still on the run	"The directors of seven different entities of the beleaguered IMA Group surrendered themselves before the police on Tuesday, hours before the government formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the investment scam. Naveed Ahmed, Arshad Khan, Nizamuddin, Nasir Hussain, Anwar Pasha, Waseem and Dadapeer had gone into hiding after an audio clip of the IMA Group founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan went viral on Monday and thousands of investors gathered in front of the company's office on Lady Curzon Road in Shivajinagar demanding their money back.

No connection with IMA, says Zameer	"Minority Welfare Minister B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan said on Wednesday he had no links with the scam-hit IMA Group, except for having sold them his property for which he received Rs 5 crore. ""That was in 2017. Before that, I had nothing to do whatsoever with this company,"" he told reporters. Khan said he visited the IMA's office late last month after receiving WhatsApp messages that the company had defaulted on payments to investors. ""In my capacity as the minister for minority welfare, I visited their office to inquire about the complaints. I was shown their gold stash and all that. They said payments had stopped for whatever reason,"" he said. ""People should've filed a police complaint as soon as the payments stopped, but they kept faith,"" Khan said and appealed to IMA founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan to resurface. ""The government is committed to protecting the interests of the investors. That's why I've been running around for the last two days."" Khan refuted reports that he was targeting Shivajinagar legislator R Roshan Baig. ""We're brothers. No one is conspiring against him."" He also said that he, along with other Congress Muslim leaders, had submitted to the chief minister and home minister a list of 25 assets belonging to the IMA promoter.

Distressed homemaker poisons kids, hangs self	A 30-year-old homemaker poisoned her two children on Monday night and hung herself at her residence in Manorayanapalya in Hebbal.Police said Pushpavathy had been married for ten years to Nagaraj, a cab driver who worked for the Embassy Group, and has an eight-year-old son Jeevan and a five-month-old baby daughter yet to be named.They said Nagaraj and Pushpavathy, who hails from Theerthahalli in Shivamogga, got married amidst strong opposition and lived at a rented house in Bengaluru.Nagaraj came home at 10 pm after work and found the door to his house locked. His wife did not respond to his calls. After repeated attempts, Nagaraj and a few neighbours broke open the door and found the children lying unconscious and Pushpavathy hanging from the ceiling on a rope she tied using a step ladder.The baby daughter was on the bed frothing from the nose and mouth, while Jeevan was on the floor. Police are not sure about the kind of poison Pushpavathy had used to kill the children.Tough lifeDuring the inquiry, Nagaraj told the police that they had a tough life for the past ten years and estrangement from her family may have prompted Pushpavathy to end her life. Pushpavathy had never been to her parents’ place after marriage.Police found a death note allegedly written by Pushpavathy, in which she said she was ending her life due to dejection. She said no one was responsible for her death. Police are awaiting a complaint from Pushpavathy’s parents who might accuse Nagaraj of abetment.“We have shifted the bodies to the cold storage at a morgue and have locked the house for ‘panchanama’ after Pushpavathi’s parents’ arrival as evidence should not be destroyed,” DCP North N Shashikumar said.He also added that the police have asked for forensic analysis of the handwriting on the suicide note.	poison,Bengaluru,Suicide,	 Jun 12 2019
8,127 complaints against IMA Group, another 12K coming	Complaints poured in against the IMA Group, a day after its founder and managing director Mohammed Mansoor Khan disappeared, leaving behind an audio clip that claimed he is going to commit suicide. Until Tuesday, police received 8,127 complaints against the company that claimed to be dealing in Halal, or Sharia-compliant, businesses. The crowd was so large that the jurisdictional Commercial Street police had to make arrangements at AS Convention Hall, Shivaji Circle, to receive the complaints. Incidentally, the venue is right next to Frontline Multispeciality Hospital run by the IMA Group. Investors — mostly poor Muslims and small-time businessmen — stood in long queues to file the complaints. To make the process easier, the police distributed a two-page form among the investors. The form stated that the police have already registered a case under IPC sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) against the IMA Group. The complainants have to provide their personal details (name, address and phone number), the amount invested and the date of investment. Many investors had to line up from morning until evening to file the complaints. Some of them found the process demanding and left midway. Police estimate that around 20,000 people invested in the company and expect many more complainants to show. Police Commissioner T Suneel Kumar told DH that they were making all efforts to track down Khan. New audio clipsMeanwhile, audio clips were circulated on WhatsApp. In one of them, a man claiming to be Khan said he was alive and urged people not to panic. He promised to pay off investors. He blamed Shivajinagar MLA, R Roshan Baig. The voice sounds distinctively different from Monday's clip and police believe it to be fake. In another clip, a man says Khan is safe in Bowring Hospital and investors will back their money back.	Crime,IMA scam,Bengaluru,IMA group,	 Jun 12 2019
18L people lost Rs 5,200 cr to dubious firms	Nearly 18 lakh people, mostly lower- or middle-class Muslims, lost Rs 5,200 crore to 16 dubious investment firms between 2013 and 2018. Few of them have got their money back. Since Islam prohibits all interest-based transactions, many fly-by-night operators in Bengaluru have lured Muslims with Halal, or Sharia-compliant, investment schemes. Some of the companies offered unbelievable, fixed returns much like interest, even though Islam clearly prohibits the latter. These companies claimed to pay dividends—similar to the profits that companies pay their shareholders. Companies like Ajmera, Aleef, Aala Ventures, Injaz International, Burraqh, Ambidant and the IMA Group initially promised up to 10% returns a month to attract investors. Once their corpus reached crores, they cut the dividend and finally went bust. Ambidant MarketingStarted at DJ Halli in 2016, Ambidant Marketing collected more than Rs 1,000 crore. Mining baron G Janardhana Reddy was arrested for allegedly taking money from the company’s owners Syed Ahmed Fareed and his son Syed Afaq Ahmed to help them escape the Enforcement Directorate scrutiny. Police seized their properties but are yet to pay back the investors.Ajmera GroupSoon after the Ambidant case, the multi-core Ajmera group fraud case came to light. In January this year, police confiscated just Rs 5.2 crore from bank accounts related to the company, besides seizing documents of properties valued at crores. Around 950 investors have submitted proofs of having invested Rs 26 crore in the company.Injaz InternationalInjaz International Builders and Developers Pvt Ltd, located in RT Nagar, lured hundreds of investors by promising to invest in real estate. Police suspect the company cheated investors to the tune of Rs 89 crore. The founder fled the country soon after a complaint was filed against the company. Police are yet to track him down.Burraqh GroupThe Burraqh Group shut down following income tax raids. Its directors are absconding.	Bengaluru,IMA group,IMA scam,Crime,	 Jun 12 2019

What's there in the audio clip?	Here’s what the audio clip, purportedly recorded by IMA Group managing director and CEO Mohammed Mansoor Khan in Urdu and English, tells: “This is to the commissioner of police, Bangalore. Sir, my name is Mansoor and I am the founder of IMA Jewels. By the time you would be listening to this message, I’m certain that I won’t be there in this world. I have decided to end my life. Sir, I built this company with a lot of hard work in the last 12 to 13 years. But because of the corruption in the Central government and the state government, I kept bribing the bureaucrats and Muslims politicians. The PMO and the RBI were misinformed (about the IMA Group). “It had become an earning opportunity for all these officers and politicians. My final problem arose when the local MLA of Shivajinagar refused to return Rs 400 crore to me when he did not get the (election) ticket. Instead of returning the money, he started sending his men to my office and residence. I and my family faced danger to our lives. I had to keep them in a village. I am in South Bengaluru but by the time you would be listening to this audio clip, I would be no more. “The only intention behind recording this audio is that I have Rs 500 crore worth of properties in Bengaluru, 30,000-carat diamonds as well as gold. Please take all of this into your custody and pay my investors. But beware of the frauds and pay only genuine investors. By the time you would be listening to this message, I would be gone out of this world. I don’t know what’s happening to me. Sir, please sell off my diamonds, gold and silver and pay the investors. The BDA’s Kumar owes me Rs 5 crore and the Shivajinagar MLA owes me money. Please collect all this money and give it to all the investors.” Starts crying and the clip ends.	jewellers,IMA Jewels,Bengaluru,	 Jun 11 2019
3,200 police complaints and counting	"At least 3,210 investors filed complaints at the Commercial Street police station after an audio clip purportedly recorded by the IMA founder, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, surfaced on Monday. Thousands of investors gathered outside the IMA Jewels store on Lady Curzon Road. They wanted to enter the building but it was locked. Police rushed to the spot and tried to control the crowd. They later told the investors to file complaints instead of protesting. Rahul Kumar Shahapurwad, DCP (East), camped at the spot as soon as the protest began in the morning. He urged the people to file complaints instead of raising slogans. When a man in the crowd wondered aloud whether filing complaints would serve any purpose, Shahapurwad replied in the affirmative, saying that would be recorded and help them get back their investment. Police later set up counters near the Bowring Hospital and the Commercial Street police station to receive the complaints. According to the police, most of the investors belong to the middle class or are small-time businessmen. ""We have deployed extra staff to receive the complaints. The fraud is estimated at Rs 500 crore. People have submitted documents of their investment along with the complaints. Most of the people lost between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 30 lakh. We received 3,210 complaints until 9 pm on Monday and more people have queued up,"" a police officer said. Speaking to DH, Shahapurwad said five teams had been formed to track down Khan and that they were also examining the authenticity of the audio clip."

IMA scam hit the poor the hardest	Thousands of investors who gathered outside the IMA Jewels store on Monday had different stories to tell about the hard-earned money that they invested in the company. Many had invested for future exigencies such as daughter’s marriage, children’s education, house construction, etc. But their hopes of earning profits ended in tears. Mohammed Khalid Ahammed, a 56-year-old contractor, said he invested Rs 1.34 crore in January 2016 after IMA founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan lured him with high returns. In a complaint to the Commercial Street police, Ahammed said the last time he received the monthly profit was in March. Suspecting fraud, he applied for the return of his principal amount but he’s yet to get it. According to Ahammed, the IMA Group also owed him Rs 3.50 crore as he had constructed many buildings of the company. Based on the complaint, police booked Khan under IPC sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating). Basheer Ahammed, a fruit vendor from Shivajinagar, invested Rs 5 lakh for his daughter’s wedding scheduled next month. Speaking to DH, he said he distributed the wedding cards believing he would get the principal amount as well as the profit. He had now sought more time from the groom’s family to arrange the money. Fathima, a homemaker, invested in the company four years ago. The monthly profit would be credited in her bank account in the first week of every month but the payment stopped in April. The company told her the business was hit due to the elections. When she applied for the return of her principal amount, she was asked to come on Monday. Police say Khan’s phone is switched off and suspect that he has fled abroad or to other states. A lookout notice has been issued to all railway stations and airports.	jewellers,IMA Jewels,Bengaluru,	 Jun 11 2019
Politicians, religious leaders backed IMA Group	"One of the reasons behind the meteoric rise of the IMA Group was its founder's proximity to politicians and Muslim religious figures. While Shivajinagar MLA R Roshan Baig is now embroiled in the case after the company's founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan blamed him in an audio clip, other politicians, too, had associated themselves with the IMA Group. In June 2017, then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah inaugurated the Government VK Obaidullah School, which the IMA Group had adopted. B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan visited the IMA Group head office soon after becoming a minister last year. Since the IMA Group claimed to deal in Halal businesses, it was quick to seek the blessings of Bengaluru's top Ulema. Mufti Mohammed Shoaibullah Khan Miftahi, who runs Maseeh-ul-Uloom seminary in Bengaluru, published a booklet in Urdu a few years ago, virtually supporting the IMA Group. Mohammed Maqsood Imran Rashadi and Haneef Afsar Azizi Rasheed, two of the well-known Ulema in the city, backed the IMA Group after the company failed to pay the monthly profits last month. Both of them reassured investors, asking them to remain patient. Previous fraudsIMA Group is the latest and the largest of Halal investment companies to go bust in recent months. In September 2018, Morgenall, a similar company, went bust, leaving investors in the lurch. In January that year, Capital Plus and Capital Infrastructure shut down after duping investors of Rs 300 crore. Previously, Injaz International, Ajmera, Aleef, Aala Ventures, Ambidant, Burraqh and other companies wound up. TV channel in extortion caseIn 2017, police arrested Lakshmi Prasad Vajpayee, the CEO of Kannada news channel Janasri, for extorting Rs 10 crore in cash and a kilogram of gold jewellery from IMA Group CEO Mohammed Mansoor Khan for not running a ""fictitious story"" about the company. Properties worth Rs 1,050 crIn a Facebook post on June 8, Mohammed Mansoor Khan stated that the IMA Group had properties worth Rs 1,050 crore in Bengaluru. ""It has physical assets but people don't have patience, people are greedy, people are anxious, people filled with anxiety..."" he wrote. Heavy discountsThe IMA Group offered attractive offers on its products and services. While IMA Jewels regularly offered a 50% discount on gold making charges, the fee was altogether waived during sales. Frontline Pharma, the company's pharmacy business with over 20 stores, offered a flat 20% discount on all medicines. IMA hospital remains openAmong all businesses run by the IMA Group, only Frontline Multispeciality Hospital, Shivajinagar, remained open on Monday."	jewellers,IMA Jewels,Bengaluru,	 Jun 11 2019
IMA Jewels scam: Fraud in the name of religion	The higher you rise, the harder you fall. This sums up the business trajectory of I Monetary Advisory (IMA), a company founded in 2006 by Mohammed Mansoor Khan. Until 2015, few people had heard of it. Khan, a Gulf-returned Bengalurean, tapped the so-called Islamic investment market to the hilt and quickly built a diversified business empire. As of June 10, when the company suddenly shut down and Khan went incommunicado, the IMA Group had businesses encompassing bullion trading, retail jewellery, gold finance, infrastructure development, housing, book publishing, print media, education, healthcare, perfume and what not. Khan targeted Muslims who shy away from investing in interest-based businesses. The company’s tagline was catchy: Your partner to (the) path of prosperity. Investors were called “sleeping partners”. IMA offered a bouquet of attractive investment schemes with monthly, quarterly and yearly returns. The amount to be invested was Rs 50,000 and its multiples. Withdrawing from the scheme was touted to be hassle-free: get your money back after 45 days. The company claimed to trade in gold and silver bars. At its peak, it doled out a 7% monthly profit. A person investing Rs 1 lakh made a neat Rs 7,000 a month. In a little over a year, s/he could easily recover the entire investment. But this profit percentage didn’t last long. It first went down to 5% before averaging 3% until February 2019. Investors started to panic when the company paid them just 1% in April 2019 in lieu of business for the previous month. Things came to a head in May when many investors didn’t receive any profit. The company’s head office — IMA Tower on Bowring Hospital Road in the heart of Bengaluru — was soon swarmed with harried investors. IMA tried to put up a brave face, saying it was in “sound” financial health and cited the temporary slowdown in bullion trading because of the general elections and the poll panel’s squeeze on investment. It claimed that profits had been paid out to 70% of the investors and that the rest would get it soon. A schoolteacher from Benson Town was among the lucky few to get the profit for April. In May, she received about Rs 3,000 on an investment of Rs 1 lakh.Investors felt reassured but many applied for withdrawal of their principal investment. But the company was in a deep mess. It couldn’t return the money. A resident of JC Nagar who sought to withdraw his Rs 2 lakh in March was promised that the money would be credited by May 15, at the end of the 45-day lock-in period. The date was pushed to May 25 and then to June 5. Then came the announcement that the company’s offices would remain closed between June 5 and June 9 for Eid holidays. IMA promised to return the investors’ money on June 10. But the day began with Khan’s now infamous audio clip. A retired professor of economics whose family invested a total of Rs 6.5 lakh was livid: “This is not Islamic investment. This is pure cheating,” he told DH. “If the company had suffered losses, it should have stated so. We are business partners and must share the loss if any. Why didn’t the company take us into confidence?”	jewellers,IMA Jewels,Bengaluru,	 Jun 11 2019

3 approach ACB claiming cheating in TDR process	Three people who lost their land to various BBMP projects have approached the Anti-Corruption Bureau, alleging cheating in the Transferable Development Rights (TDR) process.The allegations are in connection with the first FIR registered by ACB, in which TDR irregularities occurred in Kowdenahalli village of BBMP’s Mahadevapura Zone.ACB sources said the three - Hameed, Mohan and Reddy - had bought sites in Kowdenahalli village in 1989. However, the TDR for the land bought by the trio went to the original owner, as he was named in the RTC, rather than the new owners.While issuing TDR, the officials allegedly concealed the change of ownership of the land. Noting that RTC was still in the name of the old owner, they succeeded in securing General Power of Attorney (GPA) in the old owner’s name and subsequently sold TDR for the land and also the buildings in it.Revenue layout TDR, also issued for loss of buildings, was dependent on the age of the structure demolished for a development project. Circumventing this law, officials involved in the scam forged the buildings’ construction dates to bloat the value of the TDR sanctioned by the BBMP.In the case involving the trio, the accused changed the construction dates of the building by 20 years.While properties in the revenue layout acquired by BBMP were built in 1989, documents were falsified to show that the buildings were constructed in 2009 and were then sold in 2013 for a much higher value.“While acquiring buildings built two decades ago or more, agencies had to provide compensation as per the old rules. In order to bypass the law, the accused forged documents related to these properties,” sources said.Sources in ACB added that more victims of the scam cheated in a similar manner would likely approach the investigating agency in the coming days.

More state officials caught in TDR fraud	The transferable development rights (TDR) scam in BBMP seems to be getting bigger by the day, with investigating officials set to file additional FIRs in connection with the case. With the role of more government officials surfacing, ACB will write to the state government seeking permission to file FIRs against them.Additional FIRs — regarding the multi-crore scam that occurred since the TDR scheme was introduced in 2006 — are likely to be filed during the week. Meanwhile, the ACB has sought relevant documents from both the BBMP and BDA on the number of TDRs issued by the civic agencies.“Soon after the scam was unearthed, several individuals approached us with similar complaints. Indications are that the magnitude of the scam will increase from the initial estimates of Rs 700-800 crore, as more cases are being registered by the ACB,” sources said. ACB sources told DH that methods employed by scamsters to inflate TDR values were also discovered during the investigation. The TDR value, which is calculated by ascertaining the cost of the building lost during any development project and guidance value of the corresponding land, was inflated by changing either the cost of the building or guidance value or both.“Investigation also hints at possibilities of a single development rights certificate (DRCs) being sold multiple times in different zones of the city to benefit certain individuals,” sources said. Such fraud was encouraged by the fact that DRCs did not have a ‘time-locking’ period.Along with it, the delay in the scheme only increased the scope of the scam, according to officials.While irregularities unearthed by officials are in connection with the outer ring road (ORR) project, they suspect that similar methods were employed during land acquisition for Bengaluru Metro and other infrastructure projects in the city.Sources said that BDA, which was entrusted with rectifying unused TDR in 2015, was still sitting on 109 DRC files.

'Metro ‘terror suspect’ is a labourer seeking alms'	The so-called terror suspect who tried to enter the Majestic metro station on May 6 is actually a poor labourer from Rajasthan who came to Bengaluru to collect Zakat, or alms, from mosques during the ongoing month of Ramzan, police said. Sajid Khan, from Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, had arrived with his family and checked into a lodge in Cottonpet. Being new to Bengaluru, he wanted to ride the metro. But as he went through the security check, the metal detector beeped continuously and the security staff stopped him. He was wearing Taveez (amulet) on the wrist and the neck, resulting in the beeping. The presence of coins in his pocket only intensified the alarm. Khan got scared and left the metro station. He took an auto to go back to the lodge. Meanwhile, the metro officials leaked the footage to Kannada news channels, which aired it and branded him a “terror suspect” without verifying with the police. Neither Khan nor any member of his family watch television and had no idea what the Kannada channels were up to. The jurisdictional Upparpet police decided to track down the man in the footage. They stumbled upon an auto-rickshaw driver who told them that he had seen the man. He took them to the lodge. Police picked up Khan on Saturday. When Khan told them what happened that day, the police cross-checked with his relatives in Rajasthan and concluded he was indeed innocent. In a role reversal, Khan filed a complaint against all those responsible for branding him a “terror suspect”. “We have taken up the complaint and are seeking legal opinion to register an FIR,” DCP (West), Ravi D Channannavar, said. Besides the news channels, police will book metro officials who leaked the CCTV footage to the media. “A channel even claimed Khan’s Taveez was a bomb detonator,” another officer said.

Lankan visitor sends cops into tizzy	An innocuous visit to meet his former flame in Bengaluru landed a 35-year-old Sri Lankan national behind bars while security officials went into a tizzy.Joel Nirushan Samuel’s plan to get a non-encumbrance certificate from a local church with the help of his former lover in Bengaluru turned out to be a dangerous gamble, as the Sri Lankan was branded a ‘suspect’ and arrested by the immigration officials for holding a fake passport.Sources in the immigration department told DH that Samuel arrived in Bengaluru on April 28 at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) from Ukraine via Doha on a Qatar Airways flight.DetainedHe was detained following a lookout circular issued by the Assistant Director, Sri Lankan Cell, Intelligence Bureau headquarters in New Delhi, for possessing a fake Indian passport.According to the FIR, a copy of which is with DH, Samuel’s real name is Irisaha Trinty Pereira. “While the Lankan passport bore the date of birth as 29 May 1983, the fake Indian passport produced by him at the time of arrival revealed his date of birth as 7 November 1981,” stated the FIR.Following a high alert issued by both the Indian and Sri Lankan governments and a lookout notice by the Sri Lankan officials, Samuel was detained over the fake passport. The Internal Security Department (ISD) and National Investigative Agency (NIA) subsequently arrested Samuel assuming him to be a ‘terror suspect’ with possible links to the serial blasts that tore through the island nation last month.But the sleuths were in for a shock as they discovered that he was neither a terror suspect nor had any role in the attacks.Much to their dismay, the detainee was indeed Samuel and possessed only one Indian passport, which had expired. Later, Samuel was handed over to the KIA officials for further interrogation.An investigating officer presented a different account claiming him to be an Indian national in an affair with a Sri Lankan girl. “Settled in Kiev, Ukraine, he was having a living-in relationship with a Sri Lankan girl. She wanted him to get a non-encumbrance certificate from India to prove that he is unmarried,” he said.According to police officials, Samuel’s former girlfriend residing in Bengaluru promised him to get a certificate and he arrived in Bengaluru on her assurance only to get caught for having an expired passport. “He has been remanded to judicial custody currently,” the officer revealed.Interrogation by the Bengaluru police has also revealed that he was previously arrested in a fraud case in Ukraine. The KIA police have written to the Ukranian embassy to provide more details about him. The police also clarified that he was not Pereira but Samuel. Kala Krishnaswamy, Deputy Commissioner of Police (North-East), told DH that the accused had been providing various reasons for his arrival. “He revealed to us that he has come to do business in Bengaluru. But when we asked for details, he does not know anything. We are investigating the matter further,” the DCP said.	Bengaluru,Crime,	 May 11 2019

Indiranagar chit fund swindles Rs 25 crore	As many as 150 investors of a private chit fund in Indiranagar have been duped to the tune of at least Rs 25 crore.After several complaints, the deputy registrar of Co-operative Societies registered a case of fraud against Indiranagar Chit Funds Private Limited, the firm in question. A departmental source said over 150 people had invested several crores at the Indiranagar firm in the last few years. Investors sensed something amiss when the company began delaying payments and promised returns. With no sign of payments even after furnishing the last installments, complaints from investors started pouring in at the Registrar of Co-operative Societies and Chit Funds. Angry investors stormed the office of the Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Societies and Chit Funds at Sahakara Soudha on Margosa Road in Malleswaram on Thursday, demanding the deputy registrar’s intervention.Investors said the number of victims and the money swindled could go up as many are not aware that the company has stopped paying returns.

Voter slips seized from Cong workers	Acting on a tip-off from a rival political party, police seized electoral rolls and voter slips from Congress workers at Majestic on Monday. The Congress workers were found distributing voter slips bearing their candidate’s name and the party symbol. The electoral rolls and the voter slips appear to have been printed out from the election commission’s website. It’s illegal to distribute voter slips by stamping them with the name of any candidate or the symbol of a political party, a senior police officer said. Police are waiting for election commission officials to ascertain if there are any loopholes in the distribution of voters slips and if it’s okay to download the electoral rolls without permission from the poll body. “We have informed the BBMP commissioner, who is on the way. The returning officers have also been apprised of the seizure and they also are on the way. Depending on their scrutiny, a case may be taken up,” said B K Singh, Additional Commissioner of Police (West). Later in the night, electoral officers along with the police raided a complex and allegedly detained 16 people printing duplicate voter IDs, a source said. At least 10 computers and a printer were seized from the third floor of Prabhat Complex, Gandhinagar. They were printing duplicate voter IDs of people who hadn’t voted in the last 15 years. But police denied the raid, adding there were no arrests or detentions.	General Elections 2019,Voter slips,Police,Congress,Lok Sabha Polls 2019,	 Apr 16 2019

Treatment delay could have cost acid victim eye	"Stung in pain and shock after her brother-in-law threw acid on her face, Reshma Qureshi struggled without treatment for five hours. Doctors refused her treatment without an FIR. To make matters worse, her mother wiped her face with a dupatta, allowing the acid to penetrate her skin, while merely pouring room-temperature water continuously would have prevented extensive damage. ""Had the doctors treated me in time, I wouldn't have lost an eye,"" Reshma said at an interactive session organised by Prabha Khaitan Foundation, The Write Circle Bengaluru chapter. Reshma’s story — from a burqa-clad girl in the slums of Mumbai to walking the ramps at the New York fashion show — is documented in the book 'Being Reshma' by author Tania Singh. The book captures various shades of cruelty and how tragedy changes one's attitude to life.Despite a Supreme Court ban, Tania explained how easy it is for an attacker to stock acid and use it against women. ""There are more acid attacks in the UK, but they're against men. In India, the reasons are different,"" she said. ""While acid is freely available over the quota in India, it is banned in the UK."" She continued: ""In India, anyone can buy acid for Rs 40 a litre, cover their face and the number plate of their bikes, and fling it on the victim's face. They can never be traced. In the UK, acid is available only through the battery and the attacker can easily be caught,"" she said.Reshma's acid attack happened when her brother-in-law Jamaluddin tried to set her sister Gulshan on fire. Jamaluddin, who demanded dowry from Gulshan’s family, teamed up with two others and flung acid on Reshma’s face to hurt the family by defacing its youngest member. Reshma was only 17 when the attack happened. DH News Service"	Acid attack,	 Apr 13 2019

Devaraj and Chandrashekar, along with their third accomplice Manjegowda, 26, were actually manual labourers but had taken to robbery to make a fast buck. They mainly targeted college students and elderly citizens going for evening walks in northern Bengaluru, according to police. N Shashi Kumar, DCP (North), said the suspects were involved in at least eight cases of robbery and extortion since 2014. On March 8, they barged into the shed of a labourer from Bihar, stabbed him and took away cash and mobile phone. The next day, the gang robbed a couple at knifepoint. The rising armed robberies prompted the police to form a special team to catch them, Kumar added. The police team managed to arrest Devaraj and Chandrashekar near a bar in Tharabanahalli on the basis of their physical description provided by the victims. The suspects confessed to the crimes and told the police that they had hidden the weapons — two daggers and a knife — in the forest near Acharya Institutes. On Wednesday morning, police took them out for recovering the weapons as well as the booty. But the duo attacked sub-inspector Vasanth Kumar and head constable Shivaji Rao in a bid to escape. Venkatagowda, the inspector, fired a warning shot but the suspects didn't surrender. The inspector then shot both of them in the leg, immobilising them. The duo, along with the injured policemen, was taken to different hospitals for treatment. The Soladevanahalli police have opened a fresh case against them.

Real estate office fire: Foul play not ruled out	Police suspect the fire that tore through the third floor real-estate office in Basavanagudi’s Nettakallappa Circle on March 13 was not accidental. The blaze in Rajarajeshware Builddcon Pvt Ltd in the three-storey Sri Ranga Commercial Complex gutted loads of documents, directors of the company alleged in their complaint to the Basavanagudi police. A senior official said the fire could have been set off deliberately to claim destruction of documents relating to land, joint ventures, sale deeds and other legal papers related to the builder’s business activities. Intriguingly, the fire broke out in the evening when an FIR was filed against the directors of Rajarajeshware Builddcon Pvt Ltd and six other parties at the Kengeri police station. Directors Raman Lal M Sha, Mitesh Kumar Sha and six others were booked for cheating, forgery and using forged documents. Complainant Vishwanatha B N, a businessman from Jayanagar, told the police that he owned two sites measuring 6,800 square feet. In August 2013, Vishwanatha entered into a joint venture with Rajarajeshware Builddcon to build 20 flats, out of which 11 would belong to Vishwanatha and nine would go to the builder. “They forged documents and sold at least six of my flats,” Vishwanatha told DH. “They even pledged those property papers and obtained loan from finance firms. The builder duped me of at least Rs 12 crore.” He accused the builders of deliberately setting off the fire. “They wanted to buy time and hoodwink the police when they investigate (the fraud case) and ask for documents,” Vishwanatha said. A senior police official hinted that the builder could have used the same method to cheat more clients. The fire would allow them to escape police scrutiny. They could claim destruction of documents and buy more time to acquire the duplicates. Police suspect the builders could have shifted some crucial documents to other places. “We’ll investigate the case in detail and explore all angles to bring it to the logical conclusion,” the investigating officer said. What does the MD say?“Anybody can file a complaint against anyone. It was an accidental fire. I have not claimed any insurance. The entire third floor has been burnt, where there was a dining area, locker room and systems. I am not benefiting here. I know the complainant, who is a crook. He is already bankrupt. He has cheated many people and has left his house, closed his office and nobody knows where he is,” said Ramanlal Sha, the managing director of Rajarajeshware Builddcon Pvt Ltd.

Lakshmana murder clues hidden in 3 GB of data	The Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths probing the sensational murder of gangster Lakshmana said the plan to eliminate the gangster was hatched five months ago. The police pored over 3 GB of voice, text and WhatsApp conversations exchanged between Rupesh and Varshini to get to the bottom of the murder plot.B Balaraju, Assistant Commissioner of Police (organised crime wing), said the accused Rupesh and Varshini, who are lovers, hatched the plan in November 2018 after the gangster pressurised Varshini’s father to send her to Cambridge University in the UK in order to separate Rupesh and Varshini. “We had seized their mobile phones and retrieved all the data. We found that the duo had planned his murder five months back and their conversation runs into more than 3 GB of data,” said Balaraju.According to the police, the motive for the murder was not property-related but Varshini and Rupesh’s desire to end Lakshmana’s incessant interference in their love affair. The two conspirators received help from other gangsters who wanted to avenge the death of their gang leader CC Raja.We have asked for five more days of custody of Rupesh and Varshini as we need to interrogate them individually about their conversations, said Balaraju. A senior police officer said Lakshmana had become possessive of Varshini and decided to keep her as his mistress.“He tried all possible ways to spoil her relationship with Rupesh. This made the duo conspire to eliminate him,” he said. Days before Lakshmana’s murder, the accused met in Muthathi, a tourist attraction situated 109 km from Bengaluru. The accused took a room to plot the end of Lakshmana. The police visited the spot and conducted mahajar. CCB sleuths have so far arrested a total of nine accused, including Rupesh and Varshini.Three accused identified as ‘Cat’ Raja, Hemanth Kumar and Akash were shot at and arrested while they were on the run. Apart from these three, the police had taken custody of six accused till March 21.On Thursday, the 1st ACMM granted five more days of police custody of the six accused as the police said they needed to interrogate the accused. The arrest count in the murder case now stands at 12.	Murder case,Central Crime Branch police,Lakshmana,	 Mar 21 2019
TV journo in police custody for extorting Padma awardee	Television journalist Hemanth Kashyap on Wednesday remanded in four-day police custody in connection with an extortion case. Kashyap, input chief at Public TV, was arrested on Tuesday by the Sadashivanagar police after Padma Shri awardee Dr Ramana Rao B accused him and other television reporters of blackmailing him with a fake sleaze video. Kashyap demanded Rs 50 lakh for not broadcasting the video. Worried about his reputation, Rao paid him Rs 5 lakh on three different occasions. According to Rao, Kashyap had called him up on WhatsApp on March 5, saying he wants to speak to him. The same day around 4 pm, he came to Rao's Sadashivanagar clinic and introduced him as a television reporter. Kashyap told him about the video which, he claimed, was with five other television reporters. On March 19, Manjunath, a journalist with Samaya TV, contacted Rao and demanded money, saying he, too, has the video. Rao then called up Kashyap and told him about Manjunath. Rao made it clear to Kashyap that he will pay him all the money he wants if he guarantees that no one else would later blackmail him with the video. When Kashyap turned up around 6.30 pm, Rao motioned to plainclothes police who quickly detained him. Manjunath has, however, gone absconding. Police have confiscated his mobile phone and sent it to the CID's cybercrime cell for a detailed analysis. Police believe Kashyap is not a first-time offender and are reviewing his call detail record to dig more.	extortion case,	 Mar 20 2019

Talking on walkie-talkie, fake cop steals gold jewels	A man disguised as a police officer brandishing a walkie-talkie stole gold chains from unsuspecting women by employing a new mode of attention diversion in the city. Police arrested Syed Abubakar,40, of Chandra Layout, who used attention diversion on 40 women and took away their gold chains worth Rs 50 lakh. He targeted women aged above 50 as they are vulnerable. Dressed in neatly pressed police uniform and holding a walkie-talkie, Abubakar would introduce himself to his victims as a senior police officer. He would tell them that a chain snatching gang was on the prowl in the area. Abubakar would ask the women to remove their chains and cover them in a napkin. He would then give another napkin and offer to drop them till the end of the road. In many cases, he would place the napkin in the bag and make away with the gold ornaments, police said. He would tell the victims to uncover the napkin only after reaching home. When they opened the napkins at home, the women either found empty napkins, stones or fake jewellery. Abubakar diverted the women's attention by talking aloud on the walkie-talkie, which police say, is a new method of attention diversion. He would say a chain snatching gang was lurking in the area. He acted as if he was passing on instructions to his subordinates about the chain snatchers. Police seized the uniform and the walkie-talkie after arresting Abubakar, but are yet to recover all the jewellery he stole across the city. Abubakar confessed to the police that he stole the uniform from a KSRP officer and the walkie-talkie from a security guard, police added.	impersonation,robbery,	 Mar 20 2019

Pujari's extradition: Senior cop to fly to Senegal	An ADGP-rank officer from the Karnataka State Police will soon fly to Senegal to facilitate the easy extradition of gangster Ravi Pujari (50), who was detained from a barber shop there on January 19.The Ministry of External Affairs has granted clearance to a senior police officer to travel to Senegal to complete the process of extradition of Pujari. Rajneesh Goyal, Additional Chief Secretary, Home Department, refused to comment on which officer will be heading to Senegal and when.Since India has no bilateral ties with Senegal on an extradition treaty, the authorities are looking to extradite Pujari under the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, adopted in 2000, a senior officer said.According to sources, Pujari has hired a top lawyer in Senegal for Rs 7 crore to contest his extradition procedure. Since Senegal does not have capital punishment, the extradition process might require a guarantee that Pujari shall not be executed even if he is convicted under Indian laws, sources said.Indian authorities are confident of a successful extradition process as Senegal is tough on international criminals, with fugitives from Italy and China extradited in recent times. The Dakar police in Senegal had located and detained Pujari from a barber shop in January this year after he was tracked across West African countries with the help of Indian authorities, who received information about him becoming a business partner in a restaurant chain named 'Namaste India'.There are 97 extortion cases against Pujari in Karnataka alone. There are two cases in Mangaluru, from where he hails. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in one case.	Ravi Pujari,senegal,	 Mar 19 2019

Forensic analysis helps crack murder after a year	A murder that was swept under the carpet has been cracked after a year. A 30-year-old woman has been arrested for murdering her alcoholic husband with the help of her lover, police said. According to N Shashikumar, DCP (North), Sukhitha was in an unhappy marriage with Umashankar who often came home drunk and quarrelled with her. Married for 13 years, the couple were living at Dasenahalli, a village near Hesaraghatta in northern Bengaluru. They have a son and a daughter. Frustrated by marital discord, Sukhitha found solace in Srinivas, 31, their neighbour and a school bus driver by profession. The two eventually got close and started meeting secretly. Umashankar got wind of the affair and warned his wife. Sukhitha and Srinivas realised they didn’t have a chance as long as Umashankar was alive and decided to eliminate him. On February 25, 2018, Umashankar got drunk, fought with his wife and went to bed. The children slept in another room. Meanwhile, Sukhitha invited Srinivas over. As the two were having some intimate moments, Umashankar got up and caught them red-handed.He got furious but Srinivas and Sukhitha overpowered and smothered him. Srinivas left soon after. Sukhitha waited until the morning to raise an alarm that her husband wasn’t waking up. As relatives and friends arrived, she told them he had got very drunk the last night and died in sleep. But Umashankar’s uncle Ashwathappa suspected something fishy and called the jurisdictional Soladevanahalli police. A case was registered and the body was subjected to post-mortem. The police probe, however, failed to establish that it was a murder. It took a forensic examination to conclude that Umashankar was strangled. Police changed the course of the investigation and interrogated Sukhitha, whom they had suspected from the beginning. She couldn’t withstand the interrogation and revealed the truth.Police later arrested Srinivas. Both of them have been remanded in judicial custody, the DCP added.	Murder case,forensics,	 Mar 19 2019

According to officials, the couple, who landed in Bengaluru on a flight from Dubai, were intercepted on the basis of profiling.During inspection, customs officials found Premlatha wearing two crude gold bangles and a pair of anklets with a rhodium/mercury coating concealed beneath her socks.Her husband, Chand, was wearing a belt with a buckle made of crude gold and covered with the same coating. Another pair of crude bangles, a belt and a crude gold buckle with a similar coating were found inside their checked-in luggage, officials said. The crude gold weighing 1308.23 gm has been valued at Rs 43 lakh.According to customs officials, applying rhodium/mercury coating to gold to deceive customs is a new kind of modus operandi.Senior officials said there were two reasons for coating crude gold with rhodium/mercury.“Gold when passing through the scanner looks black on the screen. When the gold is coated with rhodium/mercury, the black colour is distorted, making officials assume that it is something else,” said a senior customs official.“If the gold is coated with rhodium/mercury, and since mercury is a liquid metal, even the metal detectors’ beeps will be feeble, misleading the official,” the official said, adding rhodium is more expensive than gold.Gold biscuitsIn the second case, Mohammed Aamir, who is in his early 30s and from Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, was held by officials based on profiling when he arrived at KIA from Riyadh. Upon examination, his checked-in baggage contained gold biscuits concealed in two door locks. The smuggled gold weighed 565 gm and was valued at Rs 18.7 lakh.

10 illegal borewells drilled on lakebed	Desperate to get water, people have drilled nearly 10 illegal borewells in Muthanalluru lakebed. The lake is located near Sarjapur village in South-east Bengaluru.Amid concerns by activists, the local panchayat has decided to launch a crackdown on those who drilled the borewells in the lake without their permission, alleging that nearly 200 tankers haul 5,000 litres of water a day.Being the only source for charging the ground water, the lake, which is filled with water, serves 20 villages in the vicinity.Activists in the area said water tankers ruthlessly exploit the water body. “This’s one of the oldest active lakes in the city,” said Major Santhosh Kumar who lives close to the lake.“Some borewells were drilled near the lake five months ago. Over the last 15 days, more than 10 unauthorised borewells had come up within the lake’s buffer zone,” Major Santhosh Kumar added.He said the offenders secured power to run the motors from Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited saying they need water for agriculture. “Generally, commercial borewell diggers buy land in the lake’s periphery from the farmers to illegally draw water,” he said. Under the Karnataka Groundwater (Regulation and Control of Development and Management) Act, 2011, every borewell in the city should be registered. The notification said violators would be fined Rs 10,000 and/or given three-year prison term.Anekal Tashildar Mahadev C admitted that borewells were drilled in the lakebed without his permission. “The offenders didn’t take permission; nor do they have proper licenses to drill the bores. Our staff is probing the matter and I’ll take action if they’re proven guilty,” he said.An acute water shortage has hit the Mahadevapura zone, including Sarjapura Road. In the last few days, borewells are being drilled on footpaths and lakebeds in Bellandur and Varthur areas.Tankers carrying water from these borewells are possibly supplying water to apartments along Sarjapura Road from Kaikondrahalli to Sarjapura village.	illegal borewells,Bengaluru,	 Mar 13 2019
Treasury dept official cheats man of Rs 50 lakh	"A general manager at a Dubai-based firm in Bengaluru has filed a cheating case against the assistant director of the Treasury Department for duping him of Rs 50 lakh by promising a government job through the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC). After his name failed to show up in the lists released by KPSC and when his demands of getting back his money fell on deaf ears, victim Girish K R (38), a resident of Vijayanagar, filed a complaint with the Basaveshwaranagar police on March 10.In his complaint, Girish stated he had applied for a post of a sub-registrar with the KPSC in 2016. Soon he came in contact with Sangapura, the assistant director of the Treasury Department, through his wife who was a government servant and worked in the same building.Sangapura assured Girish that he could get him the job claiming that he is a close friend of KPSC Chairman and demanded Rs 70 lakh bribe. Girish agreed to pay the money in instalments.Girish arranged the money by selling his ancestral property owned by his grandfather, selling gold jewellery his family had, along with a bank loan and borrowing from his friend. In all, he paid Rs 50 lakh to Sangapura in four instalments from October to December 2017.Following the payment, Sangapura introduced Girish to a senior High Court advocate identified as TC Hanumanthappa who claimed to be close to the KPSC chairman. He assured Girish that his name would be in the first list.The cheating came to light when Girish did not find his name even in the second list of successful candidates who secured a job through the KPSC. When he tried contacting Sangapura, his mobile phone was switched off. After repeated attempts, Sangapura’s aides picked up the calls and threatened Girish with dire consequences warning him not to contact him for money.With no option left, Girish filed the complaint with the Basaveshwaranagar police.“I am not the only victim,” Girish said. “Sangapura cheated many others. When they filed a police complaint against them, he filed a counter complaint accusing them of atrocity by playing on his minority identity. He’d blackmail the opposite parties to withdraw the cases using his lawyers."""	Job Scam,	 Mar 13 2019

Immigration officials uncover major foreign job racket	Immigration officials believe to have stumbled on a racket that aided Indians to get employed overseas by illegal means. They detained three people on arrival at the Kempegowda International Airport who travelled with passports containing fake validations. Labhu Ram, the Foreigners’ Regional Registration Officer (FRRO), said the three, including a woman, had been handed over to Bengaluru International Airport police on March 9. Unable to get a work visa, the three went to Malaysia on a tourist visa and got their passports validated with fake seals by travel agents without them having to get out of that country. Another person was arrested on similar offences on March 1. Police said travel and passport agents had duped the arrested people with jobs abroad. While one agent sent them on tourist visas, passport agents created fake employment passes for them on arrival and got them employed. They affixed fake signatures of Indian immigration officials with fake arrival and departure seals to ensure their clients are not caught in India. On suspicion, immigration officials detained Mithun Bhai Tulsibhai Khunt, 45, a resident of Surat, Gujarat. Khunt arrived at the KIA from Kuala Lumpur on March 9. Officials found his documents had been tampered with. They found that Khunt, a high school dropout, had a job offer from Mumbai Kiran Games as a manager. He flew to Kuala Lumpur on May 19, 2018, from Hyderabad on a tourist visa. But immigration officials denied him entry into Kuala Lumpur on arrival and sent him back to Hyderabad. Undeterred, Khunt flew once again to Malaysia from Chennai and met Jignesh Maaru, an agent from Gujarat. The agent got him a job as a waiter at a restaurant in Malaysia. When Khunt wanted to visit his family back home, Maaru told him he could not travel to India as he was an illegal immigrant in Malaysia. But later, the agent took money from him and got fake arrival and departure seals from Mumbai and Bengaluru, with which the Gujarat man flew back. While checking his papers, officials could not find corresponding arrival or departure documents in their records to match the seals on Khunt’s passport. Chhaya Dineshbhai Gondaliya, 28, an intermediate college dropout from Surat, was also sent from the KIA on a tourist visa to Kuala Lumpur on November 18, 2018. The agent, Jignesh Maaru, received her at KL and promised her a job. Despite staying for four months in the Malaysian capital, Chhaya could not find a job. Since her father suffered from diabetes, she wanted to return to India. Maaru reminded her of her illegal stay in Malaysia and told her she could not get home, but after repeated requests, got fake seals on her passport to enable her return. Hardeep Singh, 25, from Muktsar, Punjab, told officials on detention at the KIA that he paid the agent Kuldeep Singh a large sum for a job offer in Malaysia. On January 31, 2018, Singh flew to Malaysia on a tourist visa from the Amritsar airport. Having worked in Malaysia for more than a year, Hardeep wanted to visit his family. Kuldeep presented him with forged travel documents and got the fake seals and signatures of immigration officials in Delhi on his passport. On March 1, officials caught Jaswant Singh, a resident of Sangrur, Punjab, who arrived with forged travel documents. An agent named Gurjant Singh had also created a fake work pass for him. The Bengaluru international airport police took up all the four cases under various sections of the Passport Act and booked agents Gurjant Singh, Jignesh Maaru and Kuldeep Singh. Suspecting a larger racket, they are on the lookout for the agents.	Job Scam,	 Mar 13 2019
The girl who plotted a gangster’s end	The investigation into the murder of Bengaluru’s richest gangster, Lakshmana, 45, took a new twist with the arrest of a 21-year-old girl, Varshini, who also happens to be a post-graduate student in the UK’s Cambridge University.Explaining the sordid saga of love, obsession and murder, the police said that Lakshmana had given lakhs of rupees to Varshini, who he knew since she was a kid and, many years later, fell in love with her. But Varshini was in a relationship with another man, and this didn’t go down well with Lakshmana. This tension between the trio eventually led to the murder of Lakshmana.Varshini, daughter of Harish Sanjeevappa, alias Moote Harish, was a neighbour of Lakshmana.Her lover, Rupesh R alias Rupesh Gowda (25), a resident of RR Nagar and a native of Channapatna taluk, runs a dance class at Nagarabhavi.According to the police, Harish and Lakshmana were close friends, with Harish allegedly handling many benami properties of Lakshmana.

"Bengaluru police,Lakshmana,The investigation into the murder of Bengaluru’s richest gangster, Lakshmana, 45, took a new twist with the arrest of a 21-year-old girl, Varshini, who also happens to be a post-graduate student in the UK’s Cambridge University.
Explaining the sordid saga of love, obsession and murder, the police said that Lakshmana had given lakhs of rupees to Varshini, who he knew since she was a kid and, many years later, fell in love with her. But Varshini was in a relationship with another man, and this didn’t go down well with Lakshmana. This tension between the trio eventually led to the murder of Lakshmana.
Varshini, daughter of Harish Sanjeevappa, alias Moote Harish, was a neighbour of Lakshmana.
Her lover, Rupesh R alias Rupesh Gowda (25), a resident of RR Nagar and a native of Channapatna taluk, runs a dance class at Nagarabhavi.
According to the police, Harish and Lakshmana were close friends, with Harish allegedly handling many benami properties of Lakshmana. Since Lakshmana and Varshini were neighbours, the two made frequent visits to each others’ houses.
Lakshmana also frequently spoke to Varshini over the phone, bought her clothes and gave her money whenever she wanted it.
Things took a twist when Varshini came in contact with Rupesh when she joined his dance class a couple of years ago. Both fell in love and they allegedly eloped twice.
Distraught over his daughter’s behaviour, Harish told Lakshmana to warn Rupesh to stay away from his daughter but nothing changed.
As years passed, Lakshmana became obsessed with Varshini, who was half his age. As he wanted to be in a relationship with her, Lakshmana used to call her frequently and take her out.
To break up the couple, Lakshmana advised Harish to send his daughter to London for higher studies. In 2018, she was sent to London to study MSc in Psychology in the UK’s Cambridge University.
According to the police, Lakshmana regularly sent huge amounts of money running to several lakhs to Varshini’s bank account. But Lakshmana couldn’t achieve his objective as Rupesh and Varshini were in touch.
Both decided that if Lakshmana was alive, he won’t let them get married. So they hatched a plan to kill Lakshmana. Varshini transferred more than Rs 1 lakh to Rupesh’s account to hire supari killers.
Rupesh searched for the rival gang of Lakshmana and learnt that Raja alias ‘Cat’ Raja and his associates were waiting to take revenge against Lakshmana for killing their associate Krishnamurthy alias Maccha.
To lure Lakshmana, Varshini told him that she would be coming to Bengaluru on March 7 and asked him to book a hotel room.
On March 7, Varshini called Lakshmana and informed him that she is landing in Bengaluru asked him about the hotel booking.
All the details that Lakshmana provided about his movements to her was shared by Vashini to Rupesh, who transferred it to the killers.
When Lakshmana reached Renaissance Temple, in front of Bell Apartment at Mahalakshmi Layout, assailants came in Scorpio and Indica and hacked Lakshmana to death around 12.30 pm and fled the scene.

In the end, the manager asked his bouncers to throw them out.Shiva and Ganeshyam roughed up the bouncers, while Rakshitha tripped on the stairways and fell. “We couldn’t call the police to evict them because they’d ask us why we kept the pub open beyond the stipulated hours. So, we forced them out,” Pradeep said.An enraged Rakshitha and her friends went to Indiranagar station in an inebriated condition and filed a complaint against Farooq and his staff. She accused them of sexually assaulting her and attacking her companions. The police are yet to summon Farooq and the pub staff for questioning.	woman,pub,eviction,Indiranagar,	 Mar 07 2019

Rekha initially ignored him, but as he kept staring at her she informed me and then asked him to look away,” said Sumith.Sumith said the man immediately became furious, got down from his bike and started abusing his wife. “He then touched my wife inappropriately and when I objected, he pushed me away. He then took his helmet and hit me and there was a scuffle. As we were headed for a birthday, we just wanted him to tender an apology and part ways, but he started gathering a mob, calling us outsiders and abused us for not knowing the local language,” said Sumith.Thankfully, a uniformed BMTC staff came to the rescue of the couple, urging the mob to disperse. “The man threatened to find our house, beat us up and drive us out of the state,” said Sumith. Following the incident, the rattled couple went to JP Nagar police station, where they filed a complaint.

Phone snatchers target Bengaluru's CBD	Mobile phone snatchers have started targeting the central business district (CBD), especially MG Road, with three incidents having been reported recently.The modus operandi is straightforward: Miscreants on bikes swoop on unsuspecting people busy talking/texting on their phones and escape with their phones. According to the police, three such incidents have been reported in the recent past, but shopkeepers and autorickshaw drivers say there are many more which go unreported.One of the victims was Furquan Moharkan (26), a journalist. He was walking on the busy MG Road near Cauvery Emporium around 9.45 pm when a bike-borne duo approached him, snatched his mobile phone and sped away.“This is not the first such incident. I spoke to a few autorickshaw drivers nearby and learnt that another person was robbed in the same style a week before,” Moharkan said.On January 11, Ajith Pai (38), a corporate communications professional, lost his phone on Thimmaiah Road. Pai was speaking on his phone on a dimly-lit stretch around 8.45 pm when a duo on a Honda Activa robbed him of his phone. Pai filed a complaint with the Cubbon Park police.Also read: Phone stolen? Here’s what you can doAfter that incident, a netizen tweeted: “Bangalore is going down the way of Delhi. Soon it’ll also be the city people avoid for safety reason.”In October 2018, an IISc professor was robbed of his iPhone in the same fashion on Museum Road by two criminals riding a Honda Activa. The professor had filed a complaint with the Cubbon Park police.The city police have been unable to trace the criminals but said they had information on a few gangs. “It is difficult for us to trace the theft as these gangs are aware that police will knock on their doors if they use or sell the stolen phones,” said a senior police officer. “If the stolen ones are iPhones, they dismantle and sell the spares in the market. If they are other Android phones, they tamper with IMEI numbers and sell those phones in other states.”	theft,CBD,Bengaluru,mobile phone,	 Mar 05 2019
Families lose gold, cash to fake swamis	A three-member gang took advantage of a few residents’ belief in astrology and palmistry and decamped with their gold valuables and cash on the pretext of solving health and financial problems in south Bengaluru.The Chennammanakere Achukattu police have registered as many as three cases against the accused who targeted several families among which, police suspect, only a few have filed complaints with them.The accused have been identified as Avinash Suresh Khanvilkar alias Guruji, Chetan Dange alias Maharaj and Rajesh Tambe.Police said the accused paid special attention to their looks to lure their victims. Wearing long gold chains and rings, the conmen would observe people visiting temples and keep tabs on them.Later, they would gather information about their health and their children’s education. After getting the basic information, the gang members would begin their operation. The accused would call the victims to a temple and catch them off-guard with the personal information in their possession. Startled by their knowledge, the victims would get convinced of their abilities and do their bidding. The gang would convince their victims to conduct a special puja to address their financial and health problems. Once the house visits would begin, the gang members would ask their victims to bring their old jewellery for puja purposes. To gain their trust, they would return the gold valuables after the puja.Satisfied by their intentions, the victims would approach the accused again to seek solutions for their problems.This time, the accused would ask them to bring all their jewellery, including chains, mangalsutras, rings and other ornaments for puja. They would also make the victims transfer money through Google Pay to their accounts for the puja. After taking all gold ornaments and money, they would switch off their mobile phones and vanish.One of the victims, a 50-year-old resident of Kathriguppe East in Banashankari III stage, on condition of anonymity, said the gang members were partially right in what they said.“I believed that and gave them 170 grams of gold and Rs 1.75 lakh on various occasions,” she said. Apart from her jewellery, she also gave her family members’ gold.Suraj N, a resident of Revenue Layout in Banashankari IIIrd stage, lost 63 grams of gold jewellery and Rs 18,000 cash to the conmen.Another victim, Karthik M, a resident of Revenue Layout, lost 292 grams of gold jewellery and Rs 50,000 in cash.

MD, tax defaulter: Guard’s cup of woes boils over	Ramesh Chandramani (31), a resident of RT Nagar, is an ordinary security guard. With his meager salary of Rs 10,000, he doesn’t pay income tax. So when he received a notice from the income tax department demanding Rs 8.77 lakh for a transaction worth over Rs 2 crore, Chandramani was stumped.A native of Vellore district in Tamil Nadu, Chandramani initially ignored the I-T notice, reasoning that it was not applicable to him. But as warning notices began coming regularly to his Vellore address, he set out to inquire into the whole affair.At the I-T department, a series of shocks awaited him. First, he learnt that he was the MD of Majors SS Capitol Services on Brigade Road. He had an account in South Indian Bank and a transaction worth Rs 2.25 crore had been done through this account.I-T officials asked him to provide documents for his transactions and pay Rs 9 lakh as tax, failing which he would face stringent action.“I felt as of the world had come crashing down on me. I became suicidal but my friends and family members supported me and encouraged me to file a police complaint,” Chandramani said.To uncover the fraud, Chandramani visited the company’s office in Mittal Towers and learnt that the company had shut down. He also discovered that the firm had a CBI case against it. “They did not respond to my queries. In the bank, I found that my signature had been forged. I asked them how can they open a current account without my physical presence and attach my PAN number,” he said.He also tried to find the notary who attested his documents. Looking at the photographs submitted to open the account, he remembered that they were part of the documents he submitted while working as a security guard at JRG Security limited in HRBR Layout in Kalyan Nagar.The firm’s MD, Santhosh Kumar, had also taken photocopies of his PAN card and address proof to open his salary account. He left the company in two months. Later, Kumar told Chandramani that his documents had been misplaced.“Since they were just photocopies, I ignored them. But I did not know that I would pay such a huge price for it after a couple of years,” he told DH.Chandramani went in search of JRG Security but to his dismay found that it was also closed following which he approached RT Nagar police and filed a complaint. The case has been now transferred to Banaswadi police station.“I do not have money to pay tax. If officials wants to put me in jail, I will go as I am already in a lot of debt for attending this case and meeting I-T officials. Action should be initiated against bank officials and my previous MD Santhosh Kumar,” he told DH.	Fraud,RT Nagar,Guardsman,Income Tax department,	 Mar 04 2019

Too much FB, Insta: Man kills wife, 3-month-old baby	Facebook brought them together. A year and a baby later, the social networking site was the trigger for a grisly end to the tale.On Jan. 19, Sushma and her baby boy were killed in cold blood by her Facebook friend-turned-husband S K Raju, just three months after the couple started living together with their love child.The reason: Sushma led a colourful social media life. She was active on Facebook and Instagram, allegedly chatting with unknown men. Raju suspected she was having multiple affairs.On Jan. 19 evening, the Reliance warehouse employee who was living with Sushma and their three-month-old baby in a rented house in Madanayakanahalli, planned a bike trip to Hassan.After reaching Mysuru Road, Raju took a deviation inside Hejjala forest near Kumbalagodu. He apparently said that it was a shortcut to Wonderla, which they were going to visit. He then stopped at an isolated spot, assaulted Sushma and bludgeoned her to death. Raju then smothered their three-month-old baby and proceeded to set the bodies on fire with petrol from his bike.Incidentally, the spot was just a few kilometres away from Eagleton resort in Bidadi where a political drama was playing out at the time.The next day, a forest guard on his rounds noticed the half-burnt body of a woman in Hejjala plantation and alerted the jurisdictional Bidadi police, who in turn were busy with the assault case involving Congress MLAs Anand Singh and J N Ganesh.The Bidadi police rushed to the spot and did a scene mahazar (details of crime scene).Later, upon checking complaints about missing people in the city, they learnt that Sushma’s father had filed a complaint about his daughter and infant with Madanayakanahalli police on Jan. 26. He was called to the station and shown the belongings and photographs of Sushma. He confirmed that it was his daughter.Bidadi Police Inspector K Jeevan and Sub-Inspector B C Harish picked up Raju and during the interrogation, he confessed to killing Sushma and the baby. He told police that Sushma was chatting with other men on Facebook and took no interest in domestic chores or taking care of the child.He was arrested and remanded in judicial custody.The police haven’t found the infant’s body. They suspect that some wild animals may have consumed the remains. The area is believed to have a considerable population of leopards.Sushma, a native of Tumakuru, first connected with Raju after he sent her a friend request on Facebook. The chats soon moved to an in-person and physical relationship. She then became pregnant. After she gave birth, the couple started living together due to pressure from their parents.

CRPF man's dog brutally attacks woman	A 41-year-old woman professor suffered grievous injuries after a German Shepherd belonging to a CRPF deputy commandant attacked her in the CRPF campus.It is the second such attack by the same dog at the CRPF campus in Yelahanka New Town, whose owner was earlier accused of negligence.After the attack, the victim, Neha Jain, wife of a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officer, was admitted to a private hospital for five days. As she was bedridden, her daughter Shivangi Jain, filed a complaint on Monday at the Yelahanka New Town police station, seeking action against Ramesh Kumar, the CRPF deputy commandant, 'who let dogs out in the campus where 2,000 families reside'.At about 10 pm on December 16, Neha Jain, a New Town resident, was out on a walk, along with her elder daughter Shivangi Jain and her dog. After covering some distance, they saw deputy commandant Kumar's German Shepherd and Labrador roaming free in the campus.The duo were scared, especially when they spotted the German Shepherd, as the dog had attacked Shivangi just three months ago. They waited for a while till the dogs disappeared from the vicinity. Neha then told her daughter to stay put, so that she would go home and fetch the car.As Neha was on her way home, the German Shepherd jumped on her from the nearby bushes, tearing into her legs and her jacket. She suffered deep bites on her legs and on her back.Neha was screaming and crying for help when deputy commandant Kumar came out of his house. Despite witnessing the attack, he did not command the German Shepherd to stop. When Neha showed her leg with deep cuts and flesh wounds, Kumar allegedly told her, that he was playing with his dogs and he will continue doing it.Soon after, Neha was rushed to the hospital on the CRPF campus, but the doctors said as it was a serious injury, they can't treat her there. She was then asked to go to a private hospital outside. However, Kumar and his family allegedly stopped Neha's car and told her that they cannot allow her to go outside, and tried to block the gate. They allegedly threatened her not to take up the issue further. Neha, with the help of her daughter's friends, managed to come out of the campus somehow, and was admitted to a private hospital near Hebbal. She got seven stitches on her left leg and her stomach. Her husband, Rajesh Jain, an officer with the CRPF presently posted in Delhi, rushed to Bengaluru the next day.Shivangi, the elder daughter of the victim and an eyewitness in the case, said it was not the fault of the the German Shepherd, but it was the officer who let the dog roam freely. Action should be initiated against him, she said, adding that he misused his power as an officer, and did not show any concern for the victim. Kumar even tried to interfere when the complaint was being filed at the New Town station, said Shivangi Jain.Along with the mental trauma, Neha's family incurred expenses of nearly Rs 2 lakh, including medical expenses, her husband's flight ticket fare, and a month's salary.Police have taken up a case against deputy commandant Ramesh Kumar and has charged him under IPC section 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal) and are investigating. The Yelahanka New town police on Sunday visited the spot and conducted an inspection for further action.	CRPF,Dog,	 Dec 30 2018

BMTC student pass rate hiked by Rs 250	Rs 100 to Rs 250 for school, college and professional college students of general category. The price for renewing the pass has also been hiked by Rs 100 to Rs 220.Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) on Thursday issued new rates for bus passes for the coming academic year, effecting hikes for all students except to those going to primary schools who will continue to pay Rs 200 for the annual pass.Pre-university students will pay Rs 1,250 instead of Rs 1,100. High school boys and girls, who pay different rates, will shell out Rs 100 more.The hike is the highest for students in professional colleges who will pay an additional Rs 250. The pass for technical and medical college students has been hiked by Rs 240 and that of evening college/PhD students by Rs 200.The price for renewal of passes is similar except for a difference of Rs 30 charged for issuing the new smart card. SC/ST students have been exempted from the hike.Officials said they have opened the portal for online applications at mybmtc.karnataka.gov.in, where a list of pass issuing counters is also available. Students of primary, middle, high school and PUC can apply for a new bus pass or renew their passes, the corporation said in a release.For degree, professional, technical and medical college students, the corporation will soon announce the method for applying and collecting passes, the release said.Students vowed to protest against the move till the government rolled back the hike. “Last week, we heard from the chief minister that there will be no hike in bus pass rates. We took his word and withdrew the protest. But now, we know that we were betrayed. A state-wide stir will be launched to protest against this anti-student move,” said Roshan L, Bengaluru district secretary of AIDSO.An official in the government, however, said, “The state government will pay 50% of the expenditure while the student and the RTC bear 25% each. However, the cost of operations has doubled over the last six years. The hike bridges only a fraction of the gap,” he said.	BMTC,	 Jun 14 2019

One toilet for 60-plus workers at construction site	for the residents of Mahadevapura. But what has caused distress to them is the way the contract labourers working for it are being treated — with little or no basic hygiene.There is just one mobile toilet for more than 60 labourers engaged in construction activities at the site. This doesn’t even spare ladies. All are necessitated to use one single mobile toilet, which is locked half of the day. This has forced the labourers to use the available open spaces to answer nature’s calls, which residents think is a serious health hazard to them.The resident activists had approached the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) three months ago seeking the provision of at least three mobile toilets for the workers. But to their surprise, there is only one now. “There are no public toilets around the site at least for the ladies to use. If all the 60 workers use the same toilet, imagine the effect on their health,” said Anjali Saini, a citizen volunteer.“We, as citizen volunteers have been pressing for basic hygiene since the time the project started. After so much pressure, we sought approval for three toilets. Now when inspected, we found just one, and that too locked at 12 noon. I think we as a citizen group are also taken for a ride,” she added.The volunteers argued that according to law, the BBMP contractors “should” provide basic hygiene to the labourers at the site.However, the BBMP officials sound quite irresponsible about the situation. “The labour sheds are in Jigani, where the workers stay temporarily. They are not using the mobile toilet at the construction site much as they come finishing everything. But considering the health hazards, we have requested the higher authorities to approve two toilets for ladies and gents each. These may appear in the next two weeks at the site,” said a BBMP official, who wished to remain anonymous.He added: “In fact, the toilet is mostly used by ladies. Despite educating men not to use open spaces to answer their nature calls, they still continue to do so. But we are glad at least ladies are using the toilet.”	Bengaluru,toilet facilities,construction labourers,	 Jun 13 2019
Reconstruction of complexes : HC notice to BDA head	the Bangalore Development Authority commissioner while hearing a petition challenging a plan to demolish and reconstruct/renovate 20 BDA complexes constructed recently.A division bench comprising Chief Justice A S Oka and Justice H T Narendra Prasad was hearing a petition filed by Neelira M Subbaiah, a resident of New Thippasandra, who moved the court seeking directions to stay the proposal to renovate/reconstruct, BDA complexes at a cost of Rs 330 crore.The petitioner stated that officials in-charge neglected 20 BDA complexes due to collusion with the vested interests/offenders, who have illegally converted lakhs of residential sites into commercial ones without authority and against the BDA law, resulting in serious congestion of road.The petitioner also stated that the complexes were being used for immoral activities.The petitioner also alleged that the BDA officials in charge of the 20 complexes looted crores of rupees by obtaining false sanctions and in the guise of maintenance charges. However, the complexes are maintained below any engineering standards.The petitioner stated that spending Rs 330 crore for the renovation of the complexes is a wasteful expenditure, and the complexes can be retained as they were recently constructed and just require good maintenance.The court directed the BDA commissioner to file objections and adjourned the case for hearing to July 9.

Operators cheer DyCM’s word on carpool	carpooling app ‘Quick Ride’ has renewed the hopes of bike taxi aggregators, including Ola, whose operations were shut down owing to lack of legal provisions.In a letter to the transport minister, Parameshwara said the government should recognise and support car and bikepooling ventures.“About 6.5 lakh people or organisations have already used services of the app. The state government is also encouraging car pool / bike pool. I request you to consider their plea for recognition and give instructions to officials concerned on its operation,” he said in the letter, a copy of which is available with DH.The move comes weeks after a report by a high-level committee stating that bike taxis were not viable. Citing rising bike accidents and greater number of two-wheelers in the city, the committee made of senior officials dealing with traffic congestion said allowing commercial operation of such vehicles would make people vulnerable.Bike taxis have faced opposition from BMTC, autorickshaw union and cab drivers who have said that their revenue will be hit if the government legalises such entities.While Quick Ride operates in a slightly different model than Ola or Uber, sources in the industry said the cab aggregators would be more than happy to offer such services. “They will rule the urban transport sector if bike taxis are allowed,” an expert said but declined to comment on whether it will affect public transport.The Regional Transport Office had cracked down on Ola and Rapido, seizing more than 300 bikes offering such services. Officials have also filed a complaint against Rapido with cyber police, after the aggregator continued to run services despite the freeze.Officials were not aware of the deputy chief minister’s recommendation. “We have not heard about it. Right now, we are working on shutting illegal operations run through back door mechanisms. If the government opens the main door, then it’s a policy decision we can’t question,” an official said.

Green panel to inspect site of upcoming waste plant 	Energy (WtE) plant in Chikkanagamangala near Electronics City have prompted the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to plan a spot inspection. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) signed a deal with three companies last year to set up the WtE plant, construction for which will begin in three months. Residents are firmly opposing the plant amid mounting concerns over its hazardous effects. “The plant would be incineration-based,” Pranay Dubey, a member of the group Electronics City Rising, said. “It’ll emit toxic gases, fly ash and bottom ash. Such plants did not succeed in India and cause irrevocable damage to the environment. We need to learn from the mistakes other states have made and shouldn’t repeat them.” He said WtEs spark widespread opposition among citizens. “For example, there have been continuous protests against the Okhla plant (in Delhi) and the NGT slapped environmental compensation of Rs 25 lakh on the plant,” he said, warning that the proposed plant would destroy Bengaluru’s ecology. Residents already have to cope with the existing waste processing plant in the area that emits a foul odour and poisonous gas.Their protests failed to draw the attention of the regulatory authorities. Worried that the new plant would worsen the situation, residents wrote to the NGT that responded saying that it had processed their complaint and will inspect the place. A BBMP official said the plant would sort out mixed waste collected especially from the black spots and from the roadside.“The BBMP has no say in the location of the plant. The regulatory authority would take a call on that. We’re just beneficiaries and will abide by the decisions of the concerned authorities. We’ll see to it that the contractor follows the environmental standards while building it,” he added.	Bengaluru,National Green Tribunal,NGT,waste management,	 Jun 13 2019
Door-to-door collection of garbage in a mess	clusters across the city is in a mess. Reason: collectors come and go in a jiffy, while residents have no organised plan to keep the solid waste segregated and ready to be picked up.Is there a way out? The Bangalore Apartments Federation (BAF) offers a solution, which has worked well for thousands of flats under its umbrella: segregate the waste, place them at a central point from where the sanitation workers pick it at the time of their choice.As BAF treasurer Vikram Rai puts it, appointing working welfare committees to manage this process can do the trick.Yet, poor coordination remains a major obstacle for seamless waste pickup, as a DH team found out in localities across Bengaluru. Many residents say their efforts to segregate and collect comes to nothing when the waste pickup system does not stick to schedules.Residents of Kamalanagar, Vidyaranyapura, Thindlu, Peenya and Richards Park say they are strict about segregation. But, as Kamalanagar resident Monisha admits, this civic responsibility is not the rule. There are people who throw garbage on roads and empty fields, she adds, attributing this to the difference in timings of the arrival of trucks.In Chowdeshwari Nagar, Frazer Town, Chamarajpet and Benson Town, residents have another complaint, which finds its echo across the city: Though they segregate the waste, the garbage collectors dump them all together. This results in a lack of interest among residents to segregate.But the sanitation workers do not agree to this. They say the residents are irresponsible, and the work of segregation falls entirely on them. One of them, Chinnababu says at least 15-20 houses in a day give out mixed garbage. When the pourakarmikas refuse to accept them, residents dump the waste on the road, he adds.This contention does not cut any ice with Anjana, a resident of Marathahalli. She charges the garbage collectors with bribery. “They only go to lanes where they are paid extra. Lack of regular pay and low wages drive them to unethical practices like these. This affects the general population as a whole,” she explains.To tide over these issues, the Richards Park Residents Welfare Association has activated a plan. Association member, Zakir Hussain elaborates: “We have put up five trash cans in every apartment and two in individual homes to segregate waste, strictly following waste management rules. Palike workers collect the wet waste daily, while private workers pick up the dry waste thrice a week.”Those who miss the trucks, Hussain adds, are asked to place their bins inside the apartments. These bins are cleared the next day. “This prevents garbage being dumped on the roads, and the area remains clean.”	"Garbage collection,waste management,Door-to-door garbage collection from small apartments and unorganised residential clusters across the city is in a mess. Reason: collectors come and go in a jiffy, while residents have no organised plan to keep the solid waste segregated and ready to be picked up.
Is there a way out? The Bangalore Apartments Federation (BAF) offers a solution, which has worked well for thousands of flats under its umbrella: segregate the waste, place them at a central point from where the sanitation workers pick it at the time of their choice.
As BAF treasurer Vikram Rai puts it, appointing working welfare committees to manage this process can do the trick.
Yet, poor coordination remains a major obstacle for seamless waste pickup, as a DH team found out in localities across Bengaluru. Many residents say their efforts to segregate and collect comes to nothing when the waste pickup system does not stick to schedules.
Residents of Kamalanagar, Vidyaranyapura, Thindlu, Peenya and Richards Park say they are strict about segregation. But, as Kamalanagar resident Monisha admits, this civic responsibility is not the rule. There are people who throw garbage on roads and empty fields, she adds, attributing this to the difference in timings of the arrival of trucks.
In Chowdeshwari Nagar, Frazer Town, Chamarajpet and Benson Town, residents have another complaint, which finds its echo across the city: Though they segregate the waste, the garbage collectors dump them all together. This results in a lack of interest among residents to segregate.
But the sanitation workers do not agree to this. They say the residents are irresponsible, and the work of segregation falls entirely on them. One of them, Chinnababu says at least 15-20 houses in a day give out mixed garbage. When the pourakarmikas refuse to accept them, residents dump the waste on the road, he adds.
This contention does not cut any ice with Anjana, a resident of Marathahalli. She charges the garbage collectors with bribery. “They only go to lanes where they are paid extra. Lack of regular pay and low wages drive them to unethical practices like these. This affects the general population as a whole,” she explains.
To tide over these issues, the Richards Park Residents Welfare Association has activated a plan. Association member, Zakir Hussain elaborates: “We have put up five trash cans in every apartment and two in individual homes to segregate waste, strictly following waste management rules. Palike workers collect the wet waste daily, while private workers pick up the dry waste thrice a week.”
Those who miss the trucks, Hussain adds, are asked to place their bins inside the apartments. These bins are cleared the next day. “This prevents garbage being dumped on the roads, and the area remains clean.”

Civic apathy: Bins damaged, go missing on Church Street	attention. Lack of proper maintenance, vandalism, instances of theft and sewage overflow from a nearby street is threatening to undo the expensive beautification completed two years ago.A reality check by DH revealed that of 20 odd dustbins installed along the 700 metre stretch of the road, less than half were in a fit condition. While three of the dustbin stands along the street were ripped off both the bins — green for wet waste and blue for dry waste — six of the stands had only one of the two bins remaining. Many bins were either damaged or splattered with the stains of pans.Preetham, an employee of Bookworm, located on Church Street, blamed both the general public and civic authorities for the condition of the bins and bollards installed on the footpath. “Bins have been vandalised by the public. Generally, vandalism occurs in the later hours of the day when all shops are closed,” he said.“The bins are also not cleared regularly. There are instances when the overflowing bins are cleared once in every two or three days,” he said.Deepak Batavia, president of Church Street Occupants Association, said that the main reason for poor bins and solid waste management was that the Palike had not assigned a proper contractor.On dumping of waste in the bins, he said it was difficult for the vendors to make people drop dry and wet waste in separate bins. “However, we have directed shops and hotels to segregate waste,” he said. A meeting will be convened shortly with BBMP authorities to discuss these issues, he said.Civic apathyWhen contacted, K T Nagaraj, chief engineer (Projects Central), said the dustbins were damaged due to civic apathy. “People are damaging these bins. Moreover, there are also cases of theft. Two Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) covers of underground drainage and optical fibre cable ducts were stolen recently,” he said.The corporation has replaced the FRP covers. Against whom can we file a complaint about the damaged dustbins? he questioned. He said the BBMP, along with the police, was installing CCTV cameras which would help identify those responsible for vandalism in the future, he added.	infrastructure,TenderSURE,Bengaluru,Church Street,	 Jun 13 2019
Medicinal plant garden to come up at Kidwai	garden of medicinal plants in the near future. An estimated 2,000 plants of over 500 species are to be planted in the campus.The institute has joined hands with environmentalists and support groups for the purpose. The Kidwai campus is in a 40-acre plot with several constructions.According to the institute’s director, Dr C Ramachandra, new saplings will be planted in the available space.“The idea is to ensure that patients breathe clean air. It will benefit those who accompany the patients, the staff and everyone else at the campus,” Dr Ramachandra told DH.Environmentalist Yellappa Reddy and members of Indus Herbs are working on this. Reddy said the work has begun. “However, the debris inside the campus must be cleared first,” he said.“We intend to complete the work within 60 days,” Reddy added. Reddy and his team have listed plants that purify air and are known to kill bacteria and viruses.“The idea is to improve air quality. A sneeze is enough to spread a disease. These plants are known for medicinal value and help regulate clean air,” Reddy explained.According to Reddy, the plants would enhance aesthetics too. “We have picked plants like Plumeria. It blooms for six to seven months. The flowers contain volatile oil. On exposure to sunlight, molecules are released into the air. This is known to have various benefits,” he said.Another is Kanaka Champa, believed to have aromatic oils. “Complex chemicals and pathogens cannot easily develop resistance to it,” Reddy pointed out.Other smaller plants such as Magara Patram and Tulasi, rich in oils, have also made the list apart from aromatic hedge plants such as Vitex negundo.Once the garden is set up, the nurses and staff at the institute will tend the plants.

10 yrs on, Majestic intermodal transit hub yet to begin	at Majestic, the government has consistently looked away even as increased traffic congestion has choked the area where poor planning and lack of integration have led to chaos.As the bus station at Majestic completed 50 years earlier this month, officials noted that the crisis caused by the lack of integration in the area needs immediate attention.The first plan to set up was first drawn in 2005, but the then management had to put it aside due to the lack of clarity on the metro. To a question, retired IAS officer M R Srinivasa Murthy, who was then the managing director of KSRTC, said commuting in Majestic was a major problem even in 2005.“We prepared a plan. But had to wait for the completion of the metro project, particularly the intersection of the two lines which would determine the metro station and surrounding area. Considering that the situation has worsened today, the project needs to be taken up immediately,” said.In 2011, a draft feasibility report proposed an intermodal transit hub providing seamless connectivity between metro, BMTC and KSRTC buses. The proposal included a 40-storey building, whose commercial and office space was expected to bring in revenue for the corporation.The plan consolidated the area of BMTC and KSRTC and the hub was to come upon 32.5 acres. Of the 44 acres, nearly 8 acres were given to the Kempegowda metro station.However, the estimated cost of Rs 1,800 crore that only one bidder met the conditions made the officials take a step back. “Three major companies had expressed interest in the project. But only one met the conditions. There was a concern that awarding the project to the lone bidder would lead to controversy,” a KSRTC official said.A retired official, who was part of the corporation during the time, said the government showed no interest in taking up the proposal. “The project was later modified to reduce the cost to Rs 1,200 crore. But KSRTC was seen as an isolated agency. No one in the government tried to follow up on the project. So, it was eventually forgotten,” the official said.When the project was conceived, the vehicle population in the city was about 30 lakh. As per the recent reports, the number of vehicles in the city has crossed 80 lakh.Last year, KSRTC renewed its efforts to build the hub at Majestic and invited bids to select a consultant for preparing a new detailed project report. “Since only one bidder expressed interest, we had to call the tender again. The technical proposals and the financial proposals will be evaluated soon,” an official said.	Majestic,infrastructure,	 Jun 13 2019
An initiative to keep Bengaluru plastic-free	by around 150 ragpickers in and around Chikkabanavara, enabling them to earn a sizable Rs 4,000 a month.It then sends the plastic waste as fuel to the cement industry to replace coal.The initiative is a joint venture of Indian Beauty & Hygiene Association (IBHA) and Isha Fiber and Fuel Source (IFFS). It segregates used tetra packs, snack covers and plastic materials with aluminium coating compress and transports them to the cement industry.Though the materials pollute the air when they are burnt and are declared unfit for recycling, they could substitute coal in the cement industry, which the state pollution control board actually permits since they are burnt at temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius.“India discards 80% of plastic, around 25,000 tons per day, which goes to landfills,” IBHA president Dinesh Dayal told DH. “Bengaluru alone is generating around 3,500 tonnes of waste per day, 100 tonnes of which is thin plastic.” He said three tonnes of thin plastic can replace two tonnes of coal at the cement industry. “The material we transport (to the cement factories) is useless and a pollutant.”The initiative would also give ragpickers a chance to develop skills and find employment, while also ensuring financial security.Ragpickers are incentivised based on the weight of the plastic they collect. While a kilo of plastic fetches them Rs 4, they could earn up to Rs 100 a day by collecting 30 tonnes of plastic. “Earlier, we thought only glass bottles and (empty) milk sachets would earn us more. But we now understand the value of the waste,” Rahul, a ragpicker from Delhi, said. “Besides collection, segregation of waste keeps us occupied the whole day. We are earning our livelihood and there is guaranteed money if we do our work,” he added.People behind the initiative have plans to tie up with BBMP to increase the amount of waste. Besides cement, the plastic waste could also be used in other ways like road construction. “We are able to help the ragpickers as well as the environment though this initiative,” Dayal said.

Slow removal of tree debris in RR Nagar angers locals	Thursday’s heavy rain, residents of Rajarajeshwari Nagar are furious that they have not cleared the trees ripped during the downpour.The downpour toppled 55 trees and 250 branches. Though the city as a whole suffered due to the rain on June 6, RR Nagar bore the brunt. It took until Sunday for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike to compute the correct figures of the fallen trees, which, in the end, was nearly three times the initial estimation of 20. Tree falls also caused incessant power cuts in the area.Repeated complaints by the residents prompted Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun to inspect the locality. “When I visited the area, I learnt that the BBMP staff was working really hard for the past two days to clear the (fallen) trees and branches. Teams were working day and night,” she said.Cutting a single half-broken tree and clearing the debris takes nearly three hours, she said. “Fifty-five trees have fallen in the area. The BBMP deployed eight teams of forest department officials in the city to attend to the issues related to toppled trees. We have also brought in the control room staff for the task,” she said.Some streets in RR Nagar did not have power supply until Sunday due to the toppled trees. “I heard from tree experts that RR Nagar has several 40- to 50-year-old trees that can’t withstand heavy winds. There are no cases of trees falling due to root damages caused externally,” Gangambike said, assuring that the corporation would clear the old trees.The mayor said she has instructed forest officials not to put pressure on workers while clearing the debris. “There were instances where heavy tree logs had fallen on workers’ legs causing injury.

Reverse osmosis water filters unhealthy: WHO	"health according to a recent warning issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO).RO filters not just kills the bacteria, but removes all salts and essential nutrients such as calcium and magnesium.Experts have been warning about the rapid rise in the use of RO filters lately. Nevertheless, the government goes on installing RO plants in every nook and corner in the name of 'pure drinking water’.M V Shashirekha, former chemist at the Department of Mines and Geology, says RO plants are good for highly contaminated groundwater with nitrate, flouride, etc. ""From other sources though, RO filtered water can be harmful as it removes all essential nutrients,"" she adds. “Reverse osmosis employs a partially permeable membrane to remove ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from drinking water. This may reduce the concentration of particulate matter including suspended particles, bacteria and algae, reducing the concentration of a range of dissolved and particulate substances. Cauvery water may not require an RO filter. However, borewell water having high nitrates needs RO membrane filtering, as nitrates cannot be removed by boiling or other filters. The RO filter, meanwhile, removes all the essential minerals. To treat 10 litres of water, nine litres of water is drained, contaminating the groundwater. Those dependent on borewells must test the water quality and then zero in on the right filters,” Shashirekha elaborates.A R Shivakumar, senior scientist, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Science, says the water filter lobby is so strong that they will never allow any study that would harm the business.""RO plants are not calibrated keeping in mind the water source,"" he points out.What WHO says The presence of minimum/optimum concentration of calcium and magnesium in drinking water signify “energy content”. RO machines are very effective in cleaning water, but they remove calcium and magnesium, the elements responsible for producing energy. Therefore, long-term consumption of acidic water devoid of essential elements produced by RO filters is very unhealthy."	water quality,WHO,Bengaluru,	 Jun 09 2019
City rail division leader in SWR’s green initiatives	32 trains between Bengaluru and Mysuru from diesel to electric traction, reducing their running cost by 40%.The conversion has saved 1,260 litres of diesel for each pair of trains. Officials also said slow-moving diesel trains have been converted into Mainline Electric Multiple Units.On the occasion, Divisional Railway Manager Ashok Kumar Verma unveiled SWR’s first vertical garden at the KSR Bengaluru station.“In the past one year, we have developed about 50 gardens around the Bengaluru division. This will continue in the upcoming year and we will make this division even more beautiful. Today, we are planting more than 5,000 trees here,” he said. A total of 38,072 trees have been planted across the railway land.The division has also taken up the project to set up solar panels. The total installed capacities of the solar panels over the SBC division was 805 kWp, where 1 kWp will generate 1,500 units of electricity annually.The railways hopes to save Rs 42.63 lakh per year through this initiative.In a first of its kind initiative in SWR, the Bengaluru division also installed eight 7.5 HP and eight 5 HP solar pumps to promote renewable energy. These pumps, said to generate 1.63 lakh units of electricity, will save Rs 14.17 lakh annually.Two recycling plants — one at the KSR station with 10 lakh litre capacity and 60-70% utilisation and another at the Yeshwantpur station with 4 lakh litre capacity and 50% utilisation — were installed. Both these stations save Rs 30 lakh every month in the bill amount paid to BWSSB.In another major green effort, the Bengaluru division has taken up solid waste management mainly from railway residential colonies from where the biodegradable waste will be sent to compost sheds and non-biodegradable waste handed to the BBMP-appointed waste collectors. Adopting the Miyawaki plantation method, the division planted 2,000 saplings in 600 sqm in 2016 and 2,100 saplings in 650 sqm in 2017. It began recharging borewells and composting kitchen waste at the Krishnarajapuram diesel loco shed.(Akira Miyawaki is a Japanese botanist and expert in plant ecology, who is active worldwide as a specialist in the restoration of natural vegetation on degraded land.)

Expedite suburban rail project: minister to officials	on Friday instructed the railway officials to expedite the proposed Bengaluru suburban railway project.Angadi, who held a meeting with Railway Board officials on pending projects in Karnataka here, directed them to take up the matter with the state government and get early clearances of pending issues.Despite Railway Minister Piyush Goyal agreeing to execute the project at the earliest during his visit to Bengaluru early this year, it got delayed following the Prime Minister Office asking the Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Limited (K-RIDE) to revise the detailed project report (DPR).The Centre had asked the K-RIDE to revise the DPR considering factors like reducing the number of stations in the core city area to ensure suburban rail network does not overlap with the Namma Metro network.In the meeting, which Bengaluru Central MP P C Mohan also attended, the minister said he would also take up the matter with the state government on expediting the DPR.The minister directed the officials to complete the ongoing doubling works of the Pune- Miraj- Londa and Hubli -Davangere-Tumkur railway line by 2020.On long pending Hubbali- Ankola railway line, the minister asked the officials to take up the matter with Karnataka for getting early forest and other clearances.	suburban railways,Bengaluru,	 Jun 08 2019
Level crossings remain major bane for railways	in the city has been a major hindrance for the railways to introduce more trains, at a time when the demand for more trains on local routes has gained fever pitch.Work on removing about 25 LCs in Bengaluru division has been pending for years due to various reasons, with the lack of land to build a road over bridge (ROB) or road under bridge (RUB) becoming the major headache. The best example being the ROB near Byappanahalli railway station, where the railways completed its work back in 2014. Wilderness has taken over the half-completed bridge as defence authorities have not handed over a small piece of land required to build the landing of the bridge on the southern side.Railway activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar, who obtained the information through RTI, said LCs have affected the functioning of railways. “Eliminating LCs will enhance the capacity of railway lines by more than 50%. Add to this, doubling and automatic signalling works and there is near 100% increase in capacity.” Yashwantpur-Yelahanka, Hosur-Anekal Road, Karmelram-Byappanahalli, Banaswadi-Hebbal, Channasandra-Yelahanka, Rajanukunte-Dodaballapur, Yelahanka-Channasandra, Byappanhalli-Dharmavaram are some stretches where work has been pending for years.

K-Rera wants citizens to spot unregistered properties	verifying the registration of every property, the Karnataka Real Estate Regulatory Authority (K-Rera) has reached out to people. It has asked the public to be its eyes and ears to report unregistered properties. Officials said its recent public notice to educate people on the Rera Act was also an attempt to seek their help. While Rera is not new, it is not very well known, which is a challenge. “People should be informed (about Rera) and they should inform us if they get to know of any unregistered property,” K-Rera chairman M R Kamble said. Kamble reasoned the decision to seek public help. Officials usually run through advertisements issued by realtors to verify the details, but the department is short-staffed and it is also challenging to physically verify all the properties.Citizens can check the Rera website at the builder’s office to ascertain the registration details. They can also demand a copy of the registration from the builders. If the builders fail to produce the copy, citizens should report them to K-Rera, an official said.Most are not aware that the builder is required to present a copy of the registration or share the online details with the buyers. Officials said they also came across cases where builders and realtors have diverted the funds allocated and kept aside in the escrow account, a violation of the Rera Act which buyers should promptly report. Kamble admitted that the authority was not aware of all methods of irregularities and it is incumbent on the citizens to report them.	KRERA,Bengaluru,	 May 26 2019
Just 3-year guarantee for elevated corridor	guarantee of only three years, beyond which the state government has to fund the repairs and maintenance of the structure. Sources in the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) told DH that out of the three financial models that were proposed, the KRDCL has favoured the use of public funds under the engineering, procurement contract (EPC).According to experts, the KRDCL’s choice would mean that the elevated corridor would turn out to be just another flyover requiring huge amounts of public money for its upkeep.Officials said the other two methods of funding the project involved levying of a toll on users for a prescribed period of time.Shivakumar BS, Managing Director, KRDCL, said, “We will make use of the public money for executing the entire project as this will result in no toll on the elevated roads.”Giving details on the nature of the financial proposal, KS Krishna Reddy, Secretary, PWD, said the “financial model facilitates the bidder to construct the elevated corridor on our investment”.“The contractor can change the structural design of the bridge apart from the height, width, quality and curve junctions of the road. Following the construction, it will have the Defect Liability Period (DLP) or in common words the guarantee period of three years.”Earlier, in its Detailed Project Report (DPR), the KRDCL had proposed three financial models: Public Funds under EPC, Private Public Partnership (PPP) and PPP plus Viability Gap Funding (VGF) toll for the construction of the corridor. However, according to the KRDCL, both the second and third proposals were found to be unfeasible.	Bengaluru,KRDCL,Elevated corridors,	 May 26 2019

BBMP razes tilting building in Horamavu	"the Banaswadi railway underpass in Horamavu.It began the demolition job after evacuating seven families living adjacent to the tilting structure. The 450-square foot structure, built 13 years ago, began tilting when the adjacent site was dug up. The BBMP has filed a case against the building's owner Hukum Singh and Kumaresh who dug up the adjacent site for the foundation. The case was filed at the Horamavu police station. The BBMP evacuated the seven families living next to the tilting structure and began breaking it down on Tuesday morning. It razed 60% of the building and will complete the work by Wednesday evening. One Hitachi machine and 15 labourers were pressed into service. BBMP officials said the structure was built before Horamavu came under its jurisdiction and there are no fitness certificates in its possession. Meanwhile, the civic body has served notice to Kumaresh, who owns the adjacent plot, to stop construction activities on the site and has asked him to submit all necessary documents within 24 hours. BBMP officials have found in their preliminary investigation that the building's foundation was weak. Only three feet of soil was removed to lay its foundation, while no iron rods were used to raise the pillars. ""The building had more floors than its actual capacity and the structure tilted as a result,"" said an official."	BBMP,	 May 15 2019

The horticulture department uses treated water from a 1.5 MLD sewage treatment plant in the park and the remaining from the supply from the BWSSB. But this water is not enough. Hence, the recharge pits are necessary,"" said Shubha Ramachandran, water team head, BIOME Environmental Trust, which launched the campaign along with Friends of Lakes, a lake protection group.Another expert opined that recharge pits may generate more than 80,000 litres of water a day in future, and the park can sustain if the demand for water doesn’t increase.Bhovi community to help""We have identified around 500 families in the city from the Bhovi community, who are traditionally associated with the well-digging job known as 'Mannu Oddaru'. These people have been digging wells from more than a thousand years now. They know exactly how to dig and with the correct specifications,"" said Ram Prasad, Friends of Lakes.Ponds to be revivedThree ponds in the park, including Karagada Kunte, Lotus Pond and the one behind the Wodeyar Statue, will be revived. The newly laid paths in the park that are obstructing the flow of water will be redesigned."	Cubbon Park ,	 May 14 2019
Baiyappanahalli rail station to get major makeover	Sangolli Rayanna (KSR) station in Majestic, the Centre will upgrade the Baiyappanahalli Railway Station on international standards.To develop Baiyappanahalli on global standards, the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd (IRSDC) on Monday held a meeting with builders and investors from the city to invest on the proposed project comprising 26 lakh sq ft of built-up area.Making use of the 132 acres of land available in and around Baiyappanahalli station, the IRSDC proposes to develop six additional platforms, four station buildings, an access road, bus bay and a foot-over-bridge at the station. According to the plan, the Baiyappanahalli station will also feature a passenger lounge on the lines of airports allowing passengers to rest while waiting for trains. Besides, the station will have 30 acres of land that could be commercially developed under private-public participation (PPP).IRSDC, which is estimating a Rs 250-crore investment from private firms and builders, will offer built-up areas to investors and builders on a 99-year lease for commercial and residential purpose, while the project is expected to be completed in 6-8 years. The South Western Railway (SWR) is currently building a third station terminal at the station for which it has already invested Rs 150 crore.Speaking to DH about the project, Sanjeev Dyamannavar, city transport activist said, “The idea appears to be nice. At last the station will witness international standards. However, it would be ideal if the railways involve BMTC, BMRCL, BBMP and BDA in the coordination committee and work together.

BBMP to invest in 29 skywalks based on demand	its money in building 29 skywalks in the city. Out of the 153 proposed skywalks, only 37 are completed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). Instead of completing the pending skywalks, the Palike has proposed 29 new structures at various locations considering “huge demand”. BBMP’s decision to fund the project, at a time when it is struggling to fund other projects, is baffling.The civic body cites other infrastructural projects in the city for the delay in the construction of unfinished skywalks.“Many skywalk constructions are put on hold and some have not even started yet as there are metro stations coming up in some areas, along with ongoing road widening and white-topping works,” said a BBMP official. The bidders are refusing to take up certain projects, he added.According to the official, 29 skywalks were proposed after considerable pressure from the Bengaluru Traffic Police and citizen activists, concerned about pedestrian safety.“These 29 structures may encounter hurdles again due to other civic infrastructural projects,” he added.BBMP Commissioner, N Manjunath Prasad, said the skywalks in the city were supposed to follow the public-private partnership (PPP) model initially. “There are no takers for most skywalks. But there are areas that are demanding skywalks. Hence the BBMP has decided to invest. DPR is ready for the 29 skywalks and work orders have been issued. The project might cost more than Rs 50 crore,” said Prasad. BBMP will soon launch online monitoring of lifts and escalators on all the skywalks in the city, including the proposed 29, to check if pedestrians are actually using the skywalks. “Bosch has taken up the project to monitor online sensors. It is yet to get the green signal,” said the official.	BBMP,skywalks,	 May 13 2019
Sewage monitoring systems in Lalbagh, Cubbon Park	installing sewage quality monitoring systems to get real-time information on effluent from the Tertiary Treatment Plants (TTPs) at the city’s two prime lung spaces, Lalbagh and Cubbon Park.The monitoring system will give data on pollutants in the treated water.Much of the treated water goes toward watering the plants in both the parks, since the board supplies just a third of the actual requirement. The parks have TTPs with extended aeration. The probes (sensors) are fixed at the outlet - the point where the treated water passes through the parks’ TTP systems.Lalbagh’s TTP has 4 MLD (Million Litres Per Day) capacity, while the Cubbon Park’s TTP has 1.5 MLD capacity. The probes measure various parameters and offer a list of pollutants in the treated water. Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board’s (BWSSB) technical team will get the data every 15 minutes.The parameters include pH, temperature, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), dissolved oxygen, ammonia content and others.No manual processThe online system would obviate the existing manual process where lab reporters collect the samples and test them –a process that takes nearly five days to complete.The BWSSB has called the tenders and the monitoring system will be in place in some time.The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had control of the Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and the TTPs until a few years ago before the BWSSB took over. Both Lalbagh and Cubbon Park need 1.5 MLD of water for their plants.	Lalbagh,BWSSB,Sewage,Cubbon Park,	 May 11 2019
Are civic agencies complacent about monsoon?	city, civic agencies seem complacent in their preparedness for the forthcoming monsoon.While the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) made a list of 201 flood-prone areas in the city and handed it to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), little action has been taken to fix the issues.KSNDMC and BBMP officials planned to survey all the locations to choose 25 points for installation of water sensors. But they have only made three tentative choices -Madiwala lake outlet near silk board junction, Jayanagar east in Krishnappa Garden (behind Byrasandra tank) and Bapuji Nagar upstream of Galianjaneya temple.Deputy Chief Minister and Bengaluru Development Minister G Parameshwara had set May end to finish all preparatory work for the monsoon. Officials from both agencies assure that work has been ongoing.KSNDMC’s scientific officer-Hydrology Shubha Avinash is hopeful that the work should be over by end of May. She said her agency is working with BBMP to identify the flooding points based on previous flooding history.BBMP officials also assure that desilting and other work on stormwater drains will be done to install water sensors. But a Palike official who did not wish to be named admitted that readying all 201 places could be difficult.Both the agencies are planning to take up work at areas near drains in the first phase, depending on how the monsoon behaves. The KSNDMC also wants to independently review the works done by the BBMP in all wards.KSNDMC has listed vulnerable locations based on its mapping of the flood-prone areas since 2011.Some of the vulnerable spots in the list include Jayamahal road (from Doordarshan center to JC Nagar), Shivananda Junction (where BBMP is building the steel flyover), UB City Road, Indiranagar 80 feet Road, Kalyannagar 100 feet road, Kadugodi, Yeshwanthpur Railway station, City Market (KR Market), Wilson Garden up to Bannerghatta Road, Vidyapeeta Circle and Someshwara colony near silk board junction.

Girinagar residents oppose police station on playground	gathered in large numbers to protect a playground that was taken over to build a police station.A foundation stone was laid for building a police station on Thursday at a volleyball ground near Vivekananda Park in Girinagar, angering residents. Residents on Friday morning gathered in large numbers to protest against the government’s decision.“We have been using the ground for over 35 years. It is the only playground in this region for kids. If you are going to take away even that last standing open space, where shall we go?” questioned Sowmya Bhat, a resident of Girinagar.Krishnamurthy Hegde, another resident who was protesting said, “We are not against building a police station. But it can be built elsewhere. How could the officials hold a foundation laying ceremony when there is a model code of conduct across the state?”Later, Basavanagudi MLA Ravi Subramanya met the protesting residents and assured them that he would take up the matter with the Bengaluru city police commissioner T Suneel Kumar.“We have already discussed it with the commissioner. He has ordered a stop to the work with immediate effect and has given as assurance that the department would take up construction in a different place,” Subramanya said.	Bengaluru,	 May 11 2019
3,000 homes get dirty, foul-smelling water	water for the past six months, they were shocked to see the water filling their storage sumps entirely black on Thursday.Their complaints to BWSSB engineers have gone without response.“About 3,000 to 4,000 residents from 2nd Main to 13th Main between the Ramaiah College bus stop and Netaji Circle have been receiving contaminated water,” said M V Nagaraj, a resident, adding that no official had visited the locality to check the problem.He said the water emits a foul odour and is unusable for anything. Residents hire water tankers for non-potable purposes and use water from the filtration plant for drinking. But BWSSB assistant executive engineer K V Deepak insisted that the contaminated water went to the houses only from Thursday morning. “There was no water supply on Wednesday, leaving a vacuum in the pipes that absorbed the dirty water from the surrounding areas where they were laid,” he said.“We received complaints (about the contaminated water) only on Thursday morning and we settled it by afternoon. We have cleaned some houses and some sumps,” he said, adding the dirty water had only gone to about 500 houses.	BWSSB,Contaminated water,	 May 03 2019
Mayor assesses rain damage	for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). A few days ago, the Palike had declared its preparedness to tackle the monsoon woes ahead.Bracing for a normal monsoon, BBMP was caught off guard with the night-long rain ranging from heavy to violent in some of the Central Business District (CBD) areas, resulting in the death of a pedestrian.In less than a few hours after the showers began to lash the city, several major roads and underpasses were flooded leaving commuters stranded for hours.According to sources, some localities were waterlogged till morning reflecting poorly on the civic body’s desilting work.Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun, who had been in touch with all zones all through the night, went around the city assessing the damage.The mayor could not hold on any longer when she spotted waterlogged stretches near the Agara underpass and Sankey Road. She came down heavily on the engineers over their cavalier attitude and poor management of the situation.“At some locations, the openings of shoulder drains were small and it took quite some time to dewater the areas. But in these cases, it was sheer negligence of the engineers. I have warned them of stringent action if they continue to be callous,” Gangambike Mallikarjun told DH.While a huge quantity of silt had deposited at the underpass on the Airport Road, the underpass near Agara was not cleaned properly, according to officials.The Okalipuram stretch, where the work on the eight-lane corridor is in full swing, witnessed waterlogging till morning.“As the work is still under progress, we could not connect the drains properly at the site, leading to waterlogging. However, we have deployed special teams equipped with powerful pumps to dewater the area and make it ready for motorists,” a senior BBMP official said.B’luru Rural suffersThough a few areas in Bengaluru Metropolitan Area Zone (BMAZ) of Bescom witnessed prolonged power cuts up until midnight, the worst affected areas were under the Bengaluru Rural Area Zone (BRAZ).According to the data put out by Bescom engineers, in Bengaluru Rural, as many as 73 electric poles and at least eight transformers were damaged in the thundershower. In Bengaluru, meanwhile, only nine poles were damaged as two transformers failed.“Some of the localities such as Peenya, HSR Layout, Jalahalli, Whitefield, Kaggalipura and Lingarajapuram in the city limits were severely affected apart from Chandapura, Hoskote, Magadi, Tumakuru and Ramanagara, with both intermittent and prolonged power cuts as poles were broken and branches fell on the transmission lines,” a senior Bescom engineer revealed.

BBP wants BWSSB water for tourists, but not for animals	litres of water from the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) to meet the needs of tourists, shopkeepers and staff at the park, but not for the wild animals.Dr Sanjay Bijur, executive director, BBP, said there is a wrong assumption that the water is for the wild animals, but it is for the people who are visiting the park.“The Park receives about 25,000 visitors a month. The RO plant catering to the drinking water needs is not sufficient. Currently, the RO plant is able to filter about 100 litres of water per hour and the requirement per hour is more than what is filtered. We are about to commission two RO plants with higher capacity of filtering 1,000 litres per hour. But for the long run, we need water from the BWSSB,” added Bijur.According to the executive director, there are about 12 borewells and six lakes inside the park, quite sufficient for the wild animals. There is also a system that stores rainwater to replenish the borewells and lakes.“The animals do not require water. There is plenty now. In fact, to beat the heat, we are spraying water on the roofs of animal shelters. We will meet with BWSSB officials on Monday to decide on the feasibility of drawing water to the park,” the executive director clarified.However, B S Gangadhar, BWSSB chief engineer (maintenance), said the board’s pipeline towards Anekal and Suryanagar Housing Board crosses the Bannerghatta Circle. “The park is hardly 3 km from the circle. A water pipeline can be laid. However, the board has to take a decision on supplying water to the park,” he added.At the moment, about 1,450 mld of water is being drawn and supplied to the city. The demand for water, especially in summer, is increasing by the day. Until Cauvery Stage V gets commissioned in 2023, city dwellers will have to manage with the current supply.

Centre for excellence in Bangalore varsity	to establish a Centre for Excellence in microwave antennas and optoelectronics at the Bangalore University’s (BU) Jnana Bharathi campus.The centre will be a collabaration of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and various departments of the BU.“Rs 300 crore is proposed to be spent to develop the Centre for Excellence. This is a central government project where we will be granting 25 acres of land on lease to the state’s lone Central University. This will help the students of various streams at BU,” confirming the development, BU vice-chancellor Venugopal K R told DH.Various BU departments such as physics, mathematics, electronics, electronics and communication engineering, electrical and electronics engineering and computer science engineering stand to benefit.Both students and faculties will have access to better research, practical work and infrastructure. The project will bring down the burden on the university to establish special practical classes and laboratories.“As this is a joint collabaration of the DRDO and ISRO, students will be industry-ready. Antennas will be useful for communications and optoelectronics will be useful in electrical systems,” Venugopal added.The proposal for granting land is already approved in the syndicate and is now waiting for government nod. Soon after getting the green-signal, the project will take off. The Centre for Excellence will cater to more than two thousand students in various departments.“BU is the lone state varsity which is giving more importance to electronics and communications. We have proposed the centre as more departments stand to benefit,” a senior Central University official told DH.	Bangalore University,Centre for Excellence,	 May 01 2019
Coming up at Kidwai: 'Rich' block for poor patients	at the ‘Robinhood’ tax system model to fund the treatment for the poor.Those who can afford will be provided special treatment at nearly double the existing prices with better facilities with the establishment of a special block. Money generated here will be used to improve facilities for the poor.The block will offer facilities which the hospital authorities claim will be on par with the leading private hospitals. An estimated Rs 30 crore has been set aside for the block to be housed above the State Cancer Institute building.C Ramachandra, director, Kidwai hospital, told DH 180 to 200 more wards have been proposed that will have dedicated staff working round the clock.“We will maintain the standards of staff to patient ratio proposed by the Medical Council of India. If need be, we will also outsource the nursing staff to maintain the ratio,” he added.In the block, the wards will be air-conditioned. There will be separate nursing stations and also specialists will visit the patients at the bed.“There is an impression that government hospitals are meant for the poor. We have the best equipment. Yet, people think otherwise. We want to give the institute a facelift. The rich look at the ambience and we will provide it to them. If you are willing to shell out more, you will get the facility,” said Ramachandra.This is being planned on lines of Jayadeva Institute of Cardio Vascular Sciences and Research.The maximum charges for a bed are Rs 1,250. Other beds are for BPL patients that are free of cost. These are housed in the Shantidhama and Aniketana buildings.In the new block, prices would vary between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 per day subject to the facilities. If the cost of one session of radiotherapy is Rs 96,000 for those with BPL cards, others will have to pay Rs 2 lakh.The difference in amount will be used to improve facilities for the poor. “The rich will have to pay more for the facilities and this money will be used for the everyday needs of the poor. Even under government schemes, poor patients will have to pay beyond a limit. The amount will be adjusted here,” he said.	Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology,	 Apr 29 2019
Govt for hospital regulation following Nigerian’s death	overcharging by hospitals and said it will look into enhancing protection of patients in the wake of a Deccan Herald news report on April 25, detailing the death of a Nigerian national at Manipal Hospitals.Speaking to DH, principal secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, Jawaid Akhtar said that a provision exists within the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments (KPME) Act, allowing the public to report any hospital, dispensary or clinic that charges more than the established rate for services and care.“Public must file complaints with the health and family welfare commissioner, who is the chairman of the expert committee. An inquiry will be conducted and action will be taken,” he said and suggested that Tobi Ajisegbede of Lagos, Nigeria, who lost his mother, Juliet, at Manipal Hospitals on April 14, should write to the commissioner, asking him to initiate an inquiry.Activists and lawyers pointed out that while the KPME Act can address matters of financial abuse, it offers little in the way of offering succour to victims of negligence.Vijayakumar Seetappa of the medical watchdog, Karnataka Janaarogya Chaluvali, said a few Indian victims of negligence are able to get justice, much less than the thousands of foreign visitors who come for medical care.“There is no mechanism for redressal at all because medical care in India exists in a regulatory vacuum,” Seetappa said.City-based lawyer Taji George, who holds the same view, provided evidence of several cases of negligence by hospitals. “About 10% of all medical failures are a result of negligence and most of the victims are foreigners,” George said. “And, what is the government doing? Nothing.”Though the government mandates treatment rates, George said that a few hospitals display figures right, leading to exorbitant charges for treatment.With increasing cases of negligence, Akhtar said the government will strengthen regulations. “We are planning to appraise and train our people to be more vigilant,” he said. However, the system will only work if the public files complaints with the committee, the principal secretary added. A recap of the caseTobi Ajisegbede from Lagos, Nigeria, who lost his 58-year-old mother at Manipal Hospitals on April 14, alleged medical negligence of the hospital staff, and a pattern of extortion by the administration. For $10,000 (Rs 6,98,000), the hospital offered quick and effective results to Ajisegbede’s mother who was suffering from Lumbar Canal Stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal, compressing the nerves). But what ensued, according to Ajisegbede, was five months of prolonged treatment, which not only cost him and his family over $20,000 (Rs 13,96,000) but also his mother’s lifeOverview of medical tourismBetween 2014 and 2015, there were 4,60,000 foreigners who sought some form of treatment in Indian hospitals — 41,237 of whom had come to India on medical visas. According to figures from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics of India, these tourists added Rs 5,800,000,000 ($86.6 million) to the Indian economy.	surgeries,Medical Negligence,Regulation of hospitals,	 Apr 29 2019
Roads a bit safer as dry trees are felled	Hosur Road and Hebbal Ring Road after summer showers, the BBMP Forest Department has swung into action.The department has uprooted 615 dry trees and trimmed 3037 unhealthy tree branches in the city.The opposition slammed Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) forest officials during Saturday’s council meeting by presenting the list of fatal accidents caused by tree branches falling on the roads and urged them to take immediate action.“We could not act before such accidents occurred in all the zones of the city as we were facing a shortage of staff. Now that we have been given 7 teams extra with a total of 21 teams operating in the city, we will ensure the old and dry trees are uprooted and unhealthy branches are removed as soon as possible,” said MK Cholarajappa, BBMP Deputy Conservator of Forest.The uprooted trees will be transported to four depots located in various points of the city including Yelahanka and Kempapura where they will be auctioned. “We collected revenue of about 10 lakhs in the last one year after the auction of the felled trees and branches,” added Cholarajappa.The Department officials also explained the challenges they face in handling the issue. “Everyday, around 30 people from various NGOs meet me in my office. They emphasise on not cutting the trees. Most of the times, our contractors encounter environmentalists opposing cutting of trees at various areas,” said Cholarajappa.Forest officials also said they planted 75,000 trees last year. “We have called for tenders this year and the plantation work orders will be issued soon,” said Cholarajappa.Opposition leaders in the council accused Cholarajappa of striking a deal with a contractor regarding fallen trees and branches.Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun asked the absent DCF to inform the area corporator before felling the trees, avoid unauthorised tree felling and maintain transparency in the process.

BBMP to resume eviction drive around stormwater drains	monsoon woes across Bengaluru, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has set its eyes on the rampant encroachment of stormwater drains (SWDs). After a brief lull, the civic body, starting next week, is likely to begin its eviction drive in various zones. Briefing Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara on its action plan on Wednesday, BBMP officials stated that they have already cleared as many as 567 encroachments. Stopping its eviction drive on account of the Lok Sabha polls, the BBMP will resume it along all the SWDs, thereby putting an end to inundation of low-lying areas. This was discussed during the coordination meeting with Chief Secretary, T M Vijay Bhaskar, on Tuesday. Further, the BBMP was directed to take technical help from the Land Records Department. “Eviction is being done as per the court’s order. All SWDs will be cleared of encroachments. A team of surveyors has already been deployed to identify encroachments,” BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said. According to the findings, out of the 1,950 encroachments, 450 have been cleared. However, according to the data presented during the coordination meeting with the chief secretary, as many as 2,515 cases of encroachment were listed and in as many as 1,948 cases, surveys were yet to be conducted. While the BBMP cleared 428 encroachments in 2016-17 and 2017-18, officials cleared as many as 139 cases in 2018-19 from October 2018.	BBMP,Stormwater drains,	 Apr 25 2019
Uber to compete with public transport in new strategy	"aggregator has sought to shed its earlier claim of ""complementing"" public transport. The company has announced its vision of replacing ""public transportation, one use case at a time"", along with private vehicles. The global ridesharing giant set out its vision in documents filed at the Security Exchange Commission, United States, ahead of the much-talked-about initial public offering. India is one of the 57 countries, where the company sees potential in replacing public transport. The company goes into the details of potential markets and explains the prospect is in becoming the alternatives to the existing modes that serve trips of less than 30 miles (48 km). This essentially means that city bus services will be Uber's target. ""We believe we can continue to grow the number of trips taken with our ridesharing products and replace personal vehicle ownership and usage and public transportation, one use case at a time,"" the document explains. The latest ""strategy"" comes at a time when road transport corporations (RTCs) are in losses and lack government support. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), with losses soaring above Rs 700 crore, received a pittance in government aid. The government owes the four corporations Rs 1,080 crore as bus pass subsidy. The BMTC has written to the government requesting a ban on ridesharing services, Ola and Uber. ""The department says they have written to the Union government for its comment. Meanwhile, we are descending into losses,"" an official said. During the inauguration of Uber's office in the city, a company official had said that its operations would complement BMTC services. Vinay K Sreenivasa, a member of Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike, said it was clear that the growth strategies of companies such as Uber do not sit well with mobility strategies for cities like Bengaluru, where the idea is to have more people use public transport. ""It is time the government regulated these companies to ensure that their operations feed into the overall strategy to keep our cities sustainable. In the status quo, they are using the resources of our cities to make huge profits with no oversight,"" he said. Sreekumar K, head of Integrated Transport at the World Resources Institute, said governments should introduce regulations to create a level playing field for both private and corporate sectors. ""RTCs should improve efficiency by adopting the latest technology. The present route operations have led to BMTC buses competing with each other. The government should stop pushing them to make a profit,"" he said.Uber India did not respond to questions on the possible effects of their strategy on public transport in the country. ""Unfortunately, we won't be able to comment on the (matter) as of now,"" a spokesperson said."	BMTC,Uber,Public Transport,	 Apr 18 2019
With 2,000 BMTC buses on poll duty, services disrupted	travel within the city as disruptions in services forced them to look for last-minute alternatives.Of the 6,000 buses it operates, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) released 1,700 buses for election duty. Adding to this, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation borrowed another 200 buses on Tuesday.Though the number of people travelling during the three days is said to be less, those waiting on the platforms at the Kempegowda Metro Station, not to mention the crowds at bus stops, made it clear that the disruption has affected thousands.About 50 buses have been taken from each of the major depots like Yeshwantpur, Shanthinagar, Kengeri, Mysore Road and others. This has forced the depot managers to run services utilising available buses.“Of the 160 buses in the depot, 50 are on election duty. We have assessed routes with high demand during weekdays and weekends. We are distributing the existing resources. Trip plans have been drawn to ensure passengers are not inconvenienced,” a depot manager said.However, passengers spoke about the reduced number of trips. Devarajamma Nagappa, a flower vendor, said she waited at the Shankar Mutt for nearly two hours to catch a bus to Shivajinagar. “Buses usually come within half an hour. There is no bus even after one and half hours today and now I can’t board this,” she said, pointing at a crowded bus.Several persons aired their grievances on social media, including Twitter and Facebook. “@BMTC_BENGALURU what is the frequency of Volvo bus from manyata to silk board. From last few days people are waiting more than 30 min to get a bus specially from 5 pm to 7 pm,” Chinmaya Samal tweeted.The BMTC’s public relations staff did not respond to calls. However, an official said some disruption in service was unavoidable considering the number of buses on election duty. “We serve 38 lakh passengers. Minor disruptions will happen. Besides, many people have left the city for hometowns to vote,” he added.	General Elections 2019,BMTC,Lok Sabha Polls 2019,	 Apr 17 2019

OMBR residents get sewage-mixed water	"getting sewage water in their drinking water line, forcing them to buy water for the past 20 days. The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has been unable to find the source of this contamination and correct it. The board has also failed to provide free drinking water by tanker to the affected residents. Outraged residents say they would not cast their votes in the forthcoming elections, having been forced to spend up to Rs 1,200 for water. Prof Anthony Nirmal Raj, a resident of 2nd 'D' Cross, said residents noticed the dirty black and stinking water about four weeks ago and informed others.

Rooftop solar tool a ray of relief for consumers	in order to install a solar panel system of the right size, will be launched by the Bangalore Electricity Supply Corporation Limited (Bescom) after the elections.Crest Rooftop Evaluation for Solar Tool, has been developed by the CSTEP and has already been tested in Malleswaram on a 9 sqkm area.The corporation is now waiting for the model code of conduct to be lifted to implement it across the city. Trials were done in January and so far 50 consumers are already using the system available on the Bescom website.“The department has received over 200 requests from March. As of now, the delta version is being updated,” a senior Bescom official told DH.“We are ready to cover the 900 sqkm of the city. Consumer interactions and demonstrations have been held in Malleswaram. Feedback obtained from consumers has been incorporated and anomalies corrected,” the official added.Explaining how the tool works, the official said that consumers can know the exact measurement of their rooftop and the size of rooftop panel to be installed.Residents will also be able to know the capacity of their panels and the best angle. Consumers will be able to find experts for guidance and installers through the portal. “It will best suit apartments and small-scale industries as they are the ones having maximum difficulty in finding a place. It is also ideal for commercial spaces consuming a large amount of electricity and located in the middle of residential areas,” the official said.	Solar Panel,BESCOM,	 Apr 16 2019
Skywalk to link metro, rail stations at Yeshwantpur	be a hassle in the coming days as work is set to begin on a skywalk to connect the existing foot overbridge (FOB) of the railway station with a skywalk from the metro station. Much to the relief of thousands of passengers, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) is finalising details of the skywalk that will connect the existing FOB of the platform number 6 of the railway station.BMRCL Managing Director Ajay Seth on Friday held a meeting with officials of the South Western Railway’s Bengaluru division to get clearance for the project. “The divisional railway manager has extended support to the project. The railways has allowed us to construct the bridge,” he said. SWR officials said they had received a detailed proposal but sought changes in the design of the FOB to ensure the project will not come in conflict with their station development programme. Works have already begun to build a structure to provide canopy at the entrance of the station towards Tumakuru Road. Disputed landA stretch of disputed land between metro and railway stations has forced officials to adopt a cautious approach. “There has been no stay from the court. But I have told our officials to cross-check the same. We have already deposited the amount in court, which will be given to the owner as decided by the court,” the managing director said. About 10,000 passengers, most of them with heavy luggage, change between railway and metro stations at Yeshwantpur every day. Without a dedicated path, the walk on the 50-metre stretch between the stations is painful due to the barriers of the taxi lanes cutting across the way. The single FOB allowing direct connection is set to cost between Rs 3 crore and Rs 4 crore. Seth, however, said passenger convenience, not the cost of the project, was more important. “The cost is not significant. The skywalk will benefit thousands of people,” he added. The BMRCL had proposed the project back in 2016 but the railways had sought 7.47 crore for leasing the land for 35 years as well as maintenance and supervision of the bridge. In June 2018, BMRCL officials visited the spot after a DH report highlighted the lack of easy and safe access to the stations.	Namma Metro,skywalk,Yeshwantpur,	 Apr 13 2019
No need to white-top South End Road: PIL in HC	of South End Road from Madhavan Park to Nettakallappa Circle via Nagasandra Circle. A division bench of acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy and Justice Dinesh Kumar issued a notice to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on the petition filed by A C Chandrashekar and seven other residents of Basavanagudi. The petitioners want the court to stop the authorities from undertaking the white-topping of the said road in southern Bengaluru. The petitioners contended that the BBMP hadn’t come up with a scientific method for the white-topping of roads to provide for the smooth flow of rainwater or drainage water. No culverts have been built either. White-topping a road in an unscientific manner will result in uneven roads that will eventually hold water and damage the stretch, the residents stated and asserted that South End Road does not require white-topping. BBMP 'indifferent'What has especially upset the residents is the BBMP’s indifference to their representations. They said they had urged the civic body to stop the white-topping work but it paid no heed. The petitioners further pointed out that all the white-topping works being carried out by the BBMP are running behind schedule, and sought the court’s intervention to facilitate the conception of a scientific mechanism for white-topping. This would require: a. choosing the appropriate road, b. carrying out the work in a scientific manner and c. finishing the project on time by causing minimum inconvenience to the public. A nightmare for citizensThe BBMP’s white-topping projects have become a living nightmare for residents all over the city, causing traffic jams and resulting in dust problems.

HMT opens museum to showcase its journey	and museum in the city on Friday, showcasing its journey from a company making basic machines to manufacturing defence equipment.The museum seeks to tell HMT’s tale to the public, especially to the younger generation. “From humble beginnings in 1953, the HMT climbed a great height, and its story is also the story of India’s industrial revolution. We want the youth, who are more attracted to information technology, to see this,” said Santosh Deshpande, Joint General Manager (Administration and Public Relations) told DH.Once known as ‘jewel among the public sector’, the HMT had several subsidiary companies and had large stakes in companies spread across the country. Most of the units have now been closed, as the changing times have stopped even its sturdy wrist watches from ticking.Deshpande noted that recent developments can’t diminish the company’s contribution to India’s nation-building process. “HMT was once the leader in machine tools, from basic drilling machines to computerised ones as well as the automobile sector. We hope more people visit the museum and get inspired to take things further in basic engineering,” he said.The museum is situated amid the greenery of HMT Township in Jalahalli in the city. A children’s park, tractor joy ride, as well as a technical information centre, are part of the museum. It will be open from 10 am to 5 pm for the public throughout the week except on Tuesdays and national holidays.	HMT,Museum,	 Apr 13 2019
BMRCL to introduce common mobility card in second phase	is working on implementing the ambitious National Common Mobility Card system.The ‘One Nation One Card’ system, in effect, can be used to make payments for all public transport and will be linked to commuters’ bank accounts.The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has decided to introduce the common mobility card at all the 62 stations of Phase 2. BMRCL has finalised a contract worth Rs 148 crore.With this, the BMRCL is to phase out its smart cards gradually, while helping commuters get their common mobility card. The corporation is holding talks with banks and Bengaluru One in this regard.Ajay Seth, the BMRCL managing director, told DH that all gates at all 62 stations in Phase 2, will be ready to accept common mobility cards and the smart cards, when inaugurated in 2022. Initially, the gates will accept both common mobility cards and smart cards. “We are in the mobility business and have to facilitate smooth people movement,” Seth said.Meanwhile, the corporation will upgrade the existing Namma Metro gates with advanced tech as well.6 lakh smart cards “Around six lakh commuters already have smart cards and we cannot expect them to switch over immediately. But, eventually, the shift should happen and we are working towards that. Talks with other transport departments are also being held,” Seth added.BMRCL has set a deadline of two years from the start of Namma Metro Phase 2, for all smart card users to switch to the common mobility card. It is planning to set up kiosks and help desks in all stations. The corporation will gradually stop issuing smart cards so that people opt for the common mobility card instead. However, the choice will be left to the consumer, similar to what the banks are working towards.Interestingly, consumers have accepted the idea. Y G Muralidharan, founder trustee of Consumer Rights Education and Awareness Trust, said it was a good decision, as it is not right away imposed on people. “It is also not technologically possible to switch over immediately. There will be small aberrations, but people should absorb it for the larger interest of commuters. Meantime, BMRCL should ensure commuters are not burdened,” he said.

Apartments fined Rs 12L for not sorting trash	around eight wards in the city, that the civic body says are not adhering to waste segregation practices.“A total of Rs 12 lakh has been imposed as fine on 18 apartment complexes. The BBMP has penalised every individual house Rs 2000, that has violated the waste segregation norms,” said Manoranjan Hegde, BBMP’s chief health officer. The apartments have been given four days time to pay the penalties.The penalised apartments are in Hosakerehalli, Padmanabhanagar, Kumaraswamy Layout, Kempapura Agrahara, Ganesha Mandira, Yediyuru and Chikkalasandra wards. The BBMP had made mandatory the segregation of waste in all city households effective from February 1, 2017.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) conducted a spot inspection of the apartment complexes earlier this week and slapped fines for not segregating waste.Now, the residents are fuming over the hefty fines. BBMP’s totally unexpected move on apartments barring individual houses has raised eyebrows. Some of the apartment complexes in Kumaraswamy Layout have been imposed a penalty of Rs 1.5 lakh, according to a BBMP notification. “Our housekeeping staff segregate waste at source. Sometimes they do accidentally mix plastic with wet waste. But they fix it before the waste is moved to wet and dry waste bins. BBMP officials who came for the spot inspection thought the waste is dumped in the bins without segregation. They imposed penalties with no specific indication as to why the fine is Rs 1.5 lakh. This is too much to pay,” said Anitha Udupa, a resident of Pramukh Temple Meadows.“BBMP’s approach displays a lack of transparency. Choosing apartments that have adhered to guidelines and slapping them with fines for flimsy reasons is ridiculous. The BBMP should engage with the residents to jointly tackle the solid waste management crisis,” said Vikram Rai, treasurer and SWM lead, Bangalore Apartments’ Federation.Residents say the BBMP should also check on individual houses.“It is the duty of the Solid Waste Management (SWM) department to check individual houses. We, medical officers, focus only on bulk generators like apartments. We would love to check on individual houses too and create awareness about segregation. But we are not allowed to do that,” said a BBMP official.BBMP had called a meeting with the representatives of the apartments on Saturday to discuss issues pertaining to waste segregation and resolution.

JP Nagar road turns into garbage dump	in a mess. And there is no better illustration of this than the scene in 18th Main, JP Nagar.Thanks to the BBMP’s apathy, the area around JP Nagar Club, 18th Main, has virtually got converted into a garbage mound infested with swarms of mosquitoes.According to residents of JP Nagar Phase 2, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) solid waste management contractors are segregating waste on a road that is close to two schools, the club and a temple. They said the BBMP had turned a deaf ear to their complaints about the problem.“There is a park for senior citizens in the area. The rubbish dump has turned into a nightmare for them as it stinks. Every day, around 20 garbage vehicles come to the spot and dump waste. Senior citizens and children are suffering from lung diseases,” said Krishna, a resident.He said that even animals were also suffering, with cows eating the waste. “The black spot has also given rise to stray dog menace in the area,” he said.Uma Balakrishna, another resident of JP Nagar, said BBMP officials pleaded helplessness with them, with the civic body stating that they had to do the segregation on the road as they had no other place.“But the waste is spilling on the road and causing trouble to move vehicles. If the palike picks up waste on time, I think we can at least get rid of the stench,” said Uma.Strangely, local Corporator KN Lakshmi Nataraj cited closure of Mandur landfill as the reason for turning the road into a garbage dump. “We are also helpless. The waste can move from the spot once the Mandur landfill is open,” she said.	waste disposal,BBMP,JP Nagar,	 Mar 29 2019
BMRCL Tumakuru Rd U-turn: FOB chosen over subways	safe access to metro stations at Nagasandra and Dasarahalli metro stations, the BMRCL has decided to do away with the plan to build subways as officials are now planning to build foot overbridges (FOB) instead.It has been nearly four years since the metro began chugging till Nagasandra in May 2015. However, commuters risk their lives every day while crossing the busy Tumakuru road to reach the metro stations at Dasarahalli and Nagasandra.Several people have suffered injuries and at least three have been killed after being hit by speeding vehicles at Nagasandra metro station. At Dasarahalli, the traffic signals have failed to provide easy and safe crossover access to pedestrians walking to the metro station.The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) finally woke up to the problem and invited tenders for building subways at both the metro stations. A previous tender called in April 2018 was cancelled. The work was awarded in September last year after officials spent months to get clearances from the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).However, six months down the line, officials have now sent a proposal for building a foot overbridge in front of both the stations instead. The BMRCL did not respond to a detailed query, but sources said the subway project was dropped recently.“Preliminary works like soil testing were completed some time ago. However, during a high-level meeting recently, it was felt that the FOBs are a better solution since they are safer than subways at night, especially for women,” an official said.Subhash Shetty, a resident of Nagasandra, said the news has come as a rude shock for residents.“They wasted three years before finalising the subway projects. Now, they have gone back to square one. People are dying while crossing the roads and now they say they are rethinking on the project. We will bring this to the notice of the leaders who come asking for votes,” said Shetty, also a member of ward committee.However, a BMRCL official contended that the FOB will serve the commuters better and will be a reality sooner than the subway.“It takes about two years to build a subway, but a FOB can be built in six months. Tenders will be called once the NHAI approves the proposal,” he said.	Dasarahalli,BMRCL,Nagasandra,metro,	 Mar 29 2019
Trash is sustainable at Saahas, a city enterprise	a day, a local waste-processing firm says it has proved the old dictum — one’s waste can be another’s treasure.“Bengaluru has a big problem of trash, but what most people don’t realise is the segregation and recycling of trash can be sustainable ventures which can not only solve the city’s massive garbage problem but also help in the social mobility of the city’s rag-pickers, who are unsung heroes of this story. Because it is they who are unwittingly formalising the segregation of garbage in the city,” said Preet Prakash Khatri, the manager at Saahas Zero Waste Management Private Limited’s Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in Jigani.While the entire Saahas network collects nearly 45 tons of waste from the city a day for segregation, processing and transport to recycling companies elsewhere, the organisation’s MRF in Jigani handles dry-waste from nearly all the IT parks in the city and other multinational corporations.“Nearly 70% of our dry-waste collection is from IT companies, and the rest is from apartments, gated communities and schools,” Khatri said, adding that if 10 tons of garbage is collected everyday, seven tons are collected as part of the zero-waste programme, which aims for maximum recyclability.Trash is procured from bulk waste generators through a service-free model or from informal waste workers who are paid for the waste they collect. The workers are trained to become entrepreneurs. The segregated waste is then sold to recycling companies who can expect to turn a profit through recycling.“Through this way, waste segregation is brought in the ambit of a proper business model,” Khatri said.N S Ramakanth, a founding member of the BBMP’s Solid Waste Management Round Table praised the role of private organisations such as Saahas, helping to tackle the waste problem. But he cautioned that private enterprises alone cannot solve it.“Private companies do not have the sanction to carry out door-to-door collection unless they are properly organised,” he said.Ramakanth nevertheless pointed out the successes of the round table when it came to trash collection during events, especially at the Indian Premier League cricket matches, whose organisers had initially refused to cooperate, claiming it was impossible to make a crowd of 60,000 people segregate their waste at the stadium.“We did not take no for an answer, and backed by the BBMP officials, we are seeing to it that they are maintaining discipline.”In fact, local BBMP involvement is a must if segregated garbage collection is to work in the city, Ramakanth added.	waste management,	 Mar 28 2019
Govt’s only flight school turning students away	School, Jakkur — is facing a severe staff crunch. This has created a huge backlog in student intake.Now, the institute is turning students away. The lone instructor at the institute has been holding meetings with the government since 2015 to hire more trainers, but in vain.Thanks to the backlog, the school has decided entrance exams will be held only once a year. Till the last academic year (2018), entrance exams were held through the year. The minimum qualification will continue to be class 12.This is the only state-run flight school in Karnataka. There is another in Mysuru, but private.Since last seven years there has been just a chief flying instructor at the school — retired Wing Commander Amarjeet Singh Dange. There is also one ground attendant to assist Dange.Wg Cdr Dange said: “I put a request to the government in 2015 to hire more staff and increase the wages, so that more can apply. But the request is still pending. So, now we have decided to be stricter on the intake.”In the last seven years, of the 48 students, only six have completed the course and have got licences. Training of four students will be completed by August.The institute receives over 12 applications everyday. But now, whenever inquiries are made, the institute is diverting students to other private institutes.Captain Amar Nath, who runs a private ground training institute in the city, acknowledged the shortage of trainers and said the existing ones are overburdened.Students who approach private institutes are given ground training in India and are then sent abroad for flight training.Meanwhile, officials at the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports said: “There is a shortage of pilots across India and it is a matter of concern. It is being discussed with the ministry and the government and a decision is yet to be taken.”	Flying school,Jakkur,	 Mar 28 2019

Flyover work stalled over dues to contractor	on the Sirsi Circle flyover, resulting in traffic woes.Motorists are frustrated over the slow pace and extended deadlines, since just one side of the road from Town Hall to Mysuru Road is open and work on the other side is kept pending for the past two months.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike began asphalting of the flyover last December.The Sirsi Circle flyover, also called the Bala Gangadhara Swami flyover, links Mysuru Road with the city centre and was the first-ever flyover to be built. The civic body hoped to complete the work on Mysuru Road to Town Hall by March 15.“The BBMP hasn’t repaired the stretch for the past one month,” said Santhosh Kumar, a resident of Rajarajeshwari Nagar.“The delay is causing traffic snarls on the stretch. It is scary to ride near the City Market, where slabs on the flyover wobble whenever there’s heavy vehicular movement,” Kumar said. The BBMP is resurfacing the flyover at a cost of Rs 4 crore, the second time the work is taken up since 1999. The repairs done in 2012 lasted for just five years, as potholes and wobbling joints have made the flyover a potential accident spot in recent times.What the BBMP has to say BBMP engineer Chandrashekhar said work on the other stretch could not begin due to outstanding payments to the contractors. “The BBMP accounts section must sanction the payment of the pending amount to the contractor. The amount may be sanctioned by April and work will begin soon,” he added.	Sirsi Circle flyover,BBMP,	 Mar 28 2019
Key Metro lines dropped for elevated corridor project?	line truncated to make way for elevated corridors on the two stretches? The 17.10 km East-West Corridor-2 from Richmond Circle to Varthur passes almost entirely along the 21-km Metro Phase 3 line initially proposed by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL).The Hoskerehalli-Marathahalli line was designed to cater mainly to areas on either side of Old Airport Road. Currently, none of the Metro lines or suburban railways passes through this highly congested stretch.First proposed to the Urban Development Ministry in May 2016, this Phase 3 line did not find mention in the 2018-19 state budget. Another line from Yelahanka to Carmelaram was truncated from Iblur to Carmelaram.Besides Marathahalli on its eastern end, the proposed Metro line to Hoskerehalli was to serve HAL, Konena Agrahara, Murugeshpalya, Domlur, Command Hospital, D’Souza Circle, Vellara Junction and Town Hall (new interchange station with the Cameralaram-Yelahanka line).Further ahead, the line would touch K R Market (interchange station with the existing green line), R K Ashram, Srinivas Nagar, and Seetha Circle before reaching Hoskerehalli on the Outer Ring Road.The Hoskerehalli-Marathahalli line was part of a BMRCL presentation on five Phase 3 lines reviewed by the Ministry of Urban Development. Engineering consultancy firm, RITES had been engaged to prepare the pre-feasibility study for each of these lines over the next nine months. A detailed project report (DPR) was to be ready in 18 months.However, before anything moved on Metro Phase 3, the controversial pod taxi project was proposed along the same route.Now, that the taxi project has been effectively shelved, the Elevated Corridor project has surfaced as a definite Metro killer on the stretch.Another proposed Phase 3 Metro line, from Yelahanka to Carmelaram would also have come into direct conflict with the North-South corridor from Hebbal to Silk Board junction.This 32-km Metro line had its alignment marked through Hebbal, Mehkri Circle, Guttahalli, Chalukya Circle, Central College, Town Hall, Poornima Talkies, Shanthinagar, Dairy Circle, Forum Mall, Koramangala water tank, Agara, Iblur, Wipro and Carmelaram along Sarjapur Road.Strangely, the two lines which were in the Phase 3 pipeline for years, disappeared when the government cleared a proposal to prepare the DPR for Phase 3 in its 2017-18 budget.Neither the 2018-19 budget nor the recent budget presented by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy made mention of the lines, critical for central business district (CBD) mass mobility.Urban mobility analysts are wondering why an elevated corridor project was being preferred over Metro lines in the CBD area.	elevated corridor project,Namma Metro,Bengaluru,	 Mar 27 2019
HC slams BBMP over KR Market illegal shops	"for failing to comply with the fire safety guidelines and allowing illegal construction of shops in KR Market.A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy directed the BBMP commissioner to be present before the court on Wednesday.The court was hearing a petition filed by the flower merchants’ association and others who have challenged the setting up of illegal stalls in the public passage and fire exit areas of the KR Market to the extent of disrupting air flow that may lead to fire incidents.The petitioners contended that 95 fire accidents have already taken place in the market area. It orally observed: "" Why were illegal complexes being permitted to be set up and who is responsible for the same? What is the action taken against them? And what are the steps you would take to prevent construction illegal buildings?""The court also directed the commissioner to make a statement with regard to illegal construction of shops in the markets run by the corporation particularly, Russell Market, KR Market and Madivala Market and the steps taken to demolish alleged illegal shops in these markets.It sought to know as to how were illegal complexes permitted to be set up and who was responsible for the same.

BBMP to launch animal rescue ambulances	rescue ailing and injured animals, with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike scheduled to introduce it after the elections.The civic body has set aside Rs 25 lakh to buy three ambulances to launch the service, which animal lovers can summon by contacting the BBMP control room.“Once the call (to the control room) is made, the ambulance will dash off to pick up the animal and take it to the nearest veterinary clinic or animal birth control centres for first aid and pain relief,” a BBMP official said.Rescue efforts will be focused mostly on urban strays like dogs, cats and monkeys. The ambulance will be equipped with surgical instruments, sterilisers and support tools to treat the animals.“Many stray animals in the city die untreated during an emergency. The animal ambulance will be useful, particularly for accidents occurring in the odd hours on the city roads,” the official added.The BBMP is also planning to train the staff in the ambulance to give first aid and life-saving drugs to the animals on the spot.

Yarn bank set up to help weavers in crisis	Mysore Powerloom Silk Manufacturers Cooperative Society on Avenue Road to benefit the state’s weavers.The weavers are reeling under severe shortage and fluctuating prices of yarn. The new yarn bank comes as a huge relief for thousands of weavers in and around Bengaluru. The bank, regardless of the price rise in the open market and the menace of middlemen, ensures a steady supply of yarn to the weavers from southern Karnataka.The bank, with aid from the Centre, will supply pure silk yarn and zari to weavers who subscribe. Currently, the weavers have to source yarn locally through agents and wholesalers.“It was a daunting task for weavers as the brokers rigged prices. Adding to the woes, rising costs of cotton and related petrochemicals left the prices fluctuating,” explained M Lakshminarayana, president of the cooperative society.The bank will purchase yarn at the wholesale rate from producers with a corpus instituted by the Centre and a special purpose vehicle (SPV). “All the subscribing weavers will be provided yarn at reasonable rates to sustain production,” he said. The power loom industry supplies about 60% of the cloth requirement at the national level. Karnataka has about 1,20,000 power looms weaving silk and cotton. Most power looms are based in Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural and Tumakuru districts, with only a few in northern Karnataka.While the bank, the first-of-its-kind in Karnataka, sources its yarn from various sources, art silk is imported from China.Besides, a considerable quantity of yarn is procured from Surat and Mumbai too. Considering the requirement of silk saree weavers, yarn from traditional markets like Ramanagara and Channapatna are also procured.According to the society, several weavers have already registered at the bank. They are now benefiting from a steady and timely supply of yarn.	Silk Farmers,Karnataka,	 Mar 25 2019
GAIL pipeline leak creates tension at Electronic City	began leaking from the GAIL pipeline in AECS Layout on Sunday evening.Fire and emergency officials rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control after an hour. Senior fire officials said residents of Haraluru Road near Singasandra had called the fire control room around 7 pm as they heard noise and noticed fire break out from the GAIL pipeline.In recent times, civic authorities were responsible for causing fire accidents by digging up places where the GAIL pipeline is laid underground, though they are expected to consult a coordination committee before engaging in such works. Their continued negligence would only result in a major disaster in future, the police warned.Last month, four children were injured when a Bescom contractor damaged a GAIL pipeline at Muneshwara Block in Naganathapura near Parappana Agrahara.

Diagnostic lab cries foul after biomedical waste fine	disposal rules created a fresh controversy on Saturday. Citing unscientific disposal of biomedical waste, BBMP officials imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on Focus Diagnostics and Speciality Clinic, Rajajinagar. The lab not only cried foul but also accused BBMP officials of mixing biomedical waste with the general waste. In a press release, Dr A S Balasundar, Health Officer, BBMP, West Zone, said: “We had received a complaint that this diagnostic centre was unscientifically disposing of the biomedical waste. Upon checking, the centre was found to be violating the rules as it was disposing of the biomedical waste along with the regular waste. We have fined it Rs 1 lakh under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.” Lab rejects claimThe lab rejected the BBMP’s claim and said it had been duly following the rules ever since its inception. “We have an agreement with biomedical waste handlers and have been handing them over the waste scientifically. But BBMP personnel haven’t collected the regular waste from the hospital in the past 15-days despite our repeated requests,” Rathnakar Hegde, Managing Director, Focus Diagnostics, told DH. He accused BBMP officials of demanding Rs 1,000 a month to collect the regular waste as against the mutually agreed upon payment of Rs 500. “When we refused to oblige, they added biomedical waste to the regular waste and fined us,” he claimed. Dr Balasundar refuted the lab’s accusations, calling them “far from the truth”. “We have all the evidence, including documents and photographs, to show that the lab was not disposing of the biomedical waste scientifically,” he said.	biomedical waste,BBMP,	 Mar 24 2019

Nearly 94.5 kilometres of roads in some of the city’s central areas are set for white-topping at a cost of Rs 986 crore.

Depleting green cover, a grey area of concern	to surrender the last vestiges of its once green heritage? As the development brigade marches on with its concrete monster projects of dubious utility, here comes an alarming piece of statistics: By 2025, grey will dominate 98.5% of the city’s landscape.Tracking the city’s dangerous descent into climatic chaos for decades, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) should know what it is in store. Years ago, its arresting imagery of eight Bengaluru maps from 1973 to 2020 had shocked everyone. The 1973 map, with its 68.2% green expanse had morphed into a ‘built-up’ mosaic of 78.7% red by 2017.But this will not prick the conscience of the bull-dozers, ready to chop down over 3,500 trees for an elevated corridor project that aids none but the car-owners. On the chopping line are 120 Cubbon Park trees, even if the corridor beku brigade contends that the Queen’s Road median is outside the park boundary.A 1998 government notification had clearly defined the Park’s boundary as up to and along the Queen’s Road and Kasturba Road. The stress on ‘along’ meant the medians were part of the park, and nobody had the right to construct anything there without the Karnataka High Court’s consent. A 2001 court ruling had ratified the boundary notification, clearing all doubts.The potent threat to Cubbon Park is an arresting symbol of a deeper, far bigger malaise: An ostrich-like disregard to the wanton destruction of Bengaluru’s green heritage. The demolition continues when citizen activists, environmentalists and institutions, the IISc in particular, have left the warning bells continuously ringing.Critical green rolesLandscapes with tree cover, reminds Dr T V Ramachandra from IISc’s Centre for Ecological Sciences, recharges the groundwater, moderates the micro climate, sequesters the carbon emitted in urban environment, maintaining the natural balance.In 2016, a study led by Dr Ramachandra had conclusively established this: Bengaluru witnessed an astounding 1005% increase in paved surfaces. This coincided with a deeply troubling 88% decline in green spaces and 79% drop in water spread regions.Overlaying the administrative boundaries of 198 BBMP wards on the vegetation distribution maps from 1973 to 2012 revealed an interesting trend: The least vegetation cover (less than 1 hectare) was found in Chickpete, Shivajinagara, Kempapura agrahara, Padarayanapura and surrounding areas.Highest vegetationVarthur, Bellandur and Agaram wards had the highest vegetation cover (of over 300 ha). In quantitative terms, wards such as Varthuru, Bellanduru, Agaram, Aramane Nagara had over 40,000 trees. Chickpete, Padarayanapura, Shivajinagara, Kempapura Agrahara, and Kushalnagara wards had less than 100 trees.But is this slide irreversible? Hardly so, say IISc scientists. They have proof right inside their campus: A mini forest raised from 500 saplings of 49 native species, planted in the 1990s. “The groundwater table that was as deep as 150ft now stands at 10-15 ft. The temperature inside the miniforest is at least two degrees lower than the surrounding area,” informs Dr Ramachandra.Scaling upCan this be replicated and scaled up for the rest of the city? Yes, if one to two hectares of land is set aside for such miniforests in every ward. “When the government can acquire land for elevated corridor and similar projects, they should find land for this as well.”For the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), afforestation is all about planting saplings. Earlier this month, the Palike unveiled one such plan to plant one lakh saplings across its eight zones with support from various Non Governmental Organisations.Sapling responseThe Palike’s Deputy Conservator of Forests, M K Cholarajappa informs that the saplings are ready at BBMP’s four nurseries. Tenders have been finalised for 75,000 saplings. A sum of Rs 5 crore was earmarked in the recent budget for the project.Native species are often preferred for the saplings, those valued for timber, honge and mahogany. The Palike, he says, will also make available hole dasavala, huvarasi, sampige, basavana pada, tabebuia, jacaranda and tabebuia guayacan. Also figuring in the list are fruit-bearing trees kadu badami, jamun, gooseberry, cherry and medicinal trees such as neem, simarouba and tapasi.The saplings could take years or even decades to offer a canopy anywhere near the fully grown trees being felled for multiple projects. But what about the green behemoths that disappear without a trace from official records?Tree trackingTo digitally track the city’s tree cover and keep a tab on every tree, Bengaluru’s tree doctor Vijay Nishant had recently launched a tree census in Jayanagar. The objective is simple: To develop a verifiable database of trees, freely accessible in the public domain. As Nishant notes, this will help citizens and all stake-holders keep a strong vigil on indiscriminate tree-felling.The tree census might help call the bluff on planting claims. But, as Harini Nagendra, professor of Sustainability, Azim Premji University, points out, a qualitative analysis of the trees being planted is critical in the long-term.Species matterTrees are planted for shade, promotion of bio-diversity and reduction in air pollution. The choice of plants should reflect these objectives. “The old trees, tamarind, mango, banyan and the raintrees, had a lot of canopy. Our studies in recent years show a lot of honge and neem trees are preferred now while the old species are abandoned,” notes Harini.She cautions that this fixation with only a few species could lead to mono-culture. “In case of any pest attack, for instance, the entire lot can get wiped out. The need of the hour: A judicious mix.”	Bengaluru,green cover,	 Mar 23 2019
Artificial 'floating islands' clean Madiwala Lake	'floating islands' in Madiwala Lake, one of the oldest lakes in Bengaluru's southern section.A report by the Bangalore Mirror describes these islands as raft-like structures that are built with PVC and PET bottles as the frame and mesh and coir as the actual body. The 'islands' are fitted with plants that absorb chemicals like nitrates from the water, reducing their concentration.The KFD decided to adopt this technique after seeing several examples of it being used to clean waterbodies around the world. The benefits of these 'islands' includes helping control algae bloom by means of absorbing the nutrients that come into waterbodies through sewage. In addition, these can act as resting grounds for birds, low-cost and are easy to maintain.In Bengaluru, Puttenahalli and Hebbagodi lakes have been exposed to this form of treatment and have responded well to it, the report states, quoting Harshavardhan, Additional Conservator of Forest, Bengaluru Urban Division.The WWF is also part of the initiative and they have conducted extensive research on the quality of water in the lake and the birds that frequent it.The report says the plants used in the 'islands' are Typha and Canna, two genera of flowering plants, to absorb the nutrients. The KFD is responsible for maintaining the islands and is planning on extending this program to other lakes.	Water Pollution,Madiwala lake,forest department,	 Mar 23 2019
How's the jog? Damaged track at Lalbagh repaired	"along the Lalbagh Lake adjacent to the RV Teachers College corner. This comes as a relief to thousands of walkers and joggers who frequent the botanical gardens inconvenienced for several months now. The problem was reported by several citizens during Janaspandana — a citizen interaction programme organised by DH and Prajavani in November 2018. Besides repairing the damaged track, the department directed the contractors to keep the public toilets open as early as 5.30 am for the convenience of hundreds of regulars who flock to the park early in the morning. Speaking to DH, Chandrashekhar M R, deputy director, Lalbagh, said that all measures have been taken to ensure cleanliness in the park. M Jagadeesh, joint director (parks and public gardens), Horticulture Department, said: ""Repair of damaged roads within Lalbagh requires funds to the tune of Rs 3 crore besides administrative approval by the director. As the director who recently took over the charge is busy with the electoral process, we are unable to finalise it. Soon after the polls, a suitable decision will be taken in this regard."" Polls defer vehicle ban For making Lalbagh a ""walkers' paradise"" and adding to the list of green initiatives, the department had proposed enforcing a ban on the movement of vehicles inside the park. The plan was given approval in principle by Horticulture Minister M C Managuli and the previous horticulture director. Though the department had set a deadline of a month and a half to implement the proposal, the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha polls has come in the way. ""It was decided to ban the movement of vehicles one-and-a-half-months ago. But as all officials including our new director Dr M V Venkatesh are busy with the electoral process, we have deferred the decision until the completion of the polls,"" another senior official told DH. The department has also replaced the old welcome signage at the West Gate, besides setting up a new ticketing counter. According to the officials, during the Janaspandana event, the visitors urged the department to replace the structures."	Jogging Track,Horticulture Department,Lalbagh Botanical Gardens,	 Mar 20 2019
KSR rail station to get 5 more escalators	more escalators to the foot overbridge, linking all platforms. Railway officials had called tenders for installing five escalators at KSR Bengaluru and one at Yeshwantpur with April 4 as the deadline. The successful bidder will also be responsible for annual maintenance for three years which will commence after the two-year guarantee period.The KSR Bengaluru station, which has an annual footfall of about 2.8 crores, is also connected to the city railway metro station. At present, the foot overbridge has single escalators connecting the 10 platforms which are programmed to climb. The five escalators, whose overall cost is estimated at Rs 2.41 crore, are likely to provide an option for easy descent from the bridge. The Yeshwantpur station, which will soon see an annual footfall of 1 crore and has four escalators, will get another at a cost of Rs 48 lakh.	Krantivira Sangolli Rayanna railway station,	 Mar 18 2019
Traffic snarls at Kundalahalli Junction set to worsen	Bengaluru, owing to the construction of the underpass, may worsen in the coming days, the traffic police have warned. Commuters were quite taken aback by the four-lane underpass work that kick-started two months ago as it began unannounced.The project was proposed a decade ago, as part of a signal-free corridor to ease traffic jams at the junction.But now, the construction has turned into a nightmare to those frequenting the area with the commuting time stretching to 90 minutes on an average.According to traffic personnel, the traffic congestion is likely to increase once the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) starts building an island for underpass construction at the junction in coming months.The junction may turn too congested with the presence of barricades and supporting structures. “We may have to close the road for some days,” said Siddalingappa, assistant commissioner of police, overseeing the project. “But we will provide the best alternative routes for commuters to ensure smooth flow of traffic,” he added.The vehicles moving towards and from Varthur Kodi slow down at the junction due to construction.The alternate roads are not commuter-friendly at the moment, said Siddalingappa. “The BBMP should asphalt some of the alternate roads in Panathur and Chinnappanahali leading to Bellandur Outer Ring Road and Sarjapur Road. They are in the worst condition at present. Also, some of the suggested alternate roads are quite lengthy,” he added.Some citizens are collaborating with the BBMP, MLA Arvind Limbavali and Bangalore Traffic Police to find solutions for the traffic chaos. One of the bus stops at Kundalahalli Junction was removed on Sunday, to expand the road so that more space is created for vehicles.“There is another bus stop as an alternative to the one removed recently. The commuters are using that,” said Clement C Jayakumar, a Doddanekundi resident.Meanwhile, BBMP officials said they are in the process of restoring some alternate routes, but the work has been slowed down due to elections.Alternative roads From Varthur Road to Thubarahalli via Outer Ring RoadFrom Varthur Kodi to Varthur, Gunjur, Chikkabellandur, Carmelaram via Sarjapur RoadFrom HAL main road to Yemalur, Bellandur Kere Kodi, Kariyammana Agrahara via ORRFrom HAL Main Road to Railway Parallel Road, Chinnappanahalli, Doddanekundi Industrial Area and heading towards ITPBAlpine Eco road from Graphite India Main road to ORR Rainbow Hospital JunctionGoshala road through Garudacharpalaya	Kundalahalli Gate,traffic congestion,	 Mar 18 2019
Farmers demand Rs 1,500 cr in dues for KG Layout land	a standstill as farmers have been staging a protest since Friday. So far, not more than 30% of the civil works have been completed.The farmers are demanding compensation from the government for their land acquired for the residential colony. Over 400 farmers are agitating against the BDA, demanding due compensation, pending to the tune of around Rs 1,500 crore.Agitating farmers chased away the contractors on Friday night. Since Saturday morning, they are guarding their land.The protesters have divided themselves into groups comprising about a 100 each. They are keeping round-the-clock vigil. They say they will not allow any work until the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) sort out the matter.BDA earmarked 4,043.27 acres of land between Mysuru Road and Magadi Road for the layout, which falls in the Yeshwantpur assembly constituency. BDA Chairman S T Somashekhar is the MLA from Yeshwantpur.In the first and second phase, BDA allotted 5,000 sites to allottees. BDA had also announced to accommodate 4,000 allottees of Arkavathi Layout.Channappa, a farmer who owns three acres of land in Kensinapura, said BDA was to give farmers Rs 80 lakh or 9,583 sq ft of land as compensation for every acre acquired. But, the BDA gave only acquisition notices. So until the compensation is given, the land belongs to farmers.“We submitted a memorandum to the BDA chairman and commissioner on Saturday. They tried to pacify us, but we are not convinced. We told them officials are demanding a bribe to move our files. We will not part with our land unless we get due compensation,” he said.However, site allottees said their suffering will only increase because of the tussle between farmers and the BDA. They fear this layout will also become like Arkavathi Layout, which has not been realised even after 12 years. Kempegowda Layout is the first layout to be formed after Arkavathi Layout.Surya Kiran, an allottee said: “First phase allottees have already been given bank notices for failing to start construction on their sites. They were given sites in 2016. We were unable to construct because there are no facilities available. Thanks to the ongoing tussle, it will take longer, which means we will suffer financial losses.”Somashekhar, meanwhile, said issues have cropped up due to financial irregularities and the matter will be looked into.

Poll code not an excuse to delay ad bylaws: HC to govt	Sabha elections will not affect finalising the advertising bylaws, the high court told the state government.The court issued the direction after the government attributed the delay in preparing the draft BBMP outdoor signage and public messaging bylaws to the election code. It was hearing a public interest litigation petition asking its directions to remove hoardings and posters.The court also told the government that it is giving a final chance to finish the draft bylaws by next week.The court also allowed the BBMP to permit polling stations, banks, hospitals, schools and other places to display posters for election campaigns. This follows the filing of an affidavit by the BBMP, asking the court’s permission to display poll advertisements after it received a letter from the Election Commission of India.

Apex court admits plea against NGT order to freeze PRR	Authority’s plea, challenging the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order, freezing the 65-km, eight-lane ring road project based on a five-year-old environmental clearance.While orally observing that the project would be important for the city’s growing traffic needs, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta said the court would examine if a fresh green clearance is needed.It posted the matter for detailed hearing on April 1 and issued notices to Sudhakar Hegde and others, whose plea prompted the NGT to freeze the project last month.‘Indefinitely stayed’Appearing for the BDA, advocates Shyam Divan and Sanjay M Nuli said the tribunal had “indefinitely stayed” the entire Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) phase 1 project proponent until a fresh environmental impact assessment is obtained.This, they said, would result in cost escalations from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 12,000 crore. The PRR phase 1 connects Tumakuru Road with Hosur Road, cutting through Ballari Road and Old Madras Road.Appearing for Hegde and others, advocate Nikhil Nayar said the project should have been completed within three years of the granting of the environmental clearance. He said the NGT had noted five years of delay and refused to allow the project on the basis of the previous environment impact assessment.The BDA council said a decision has been made to realign the petroleum pipeline and fresh land is provided for trees.The state government said the road was planned to address Bengaluru’s need for faster vehicular commutation, decongest existing roads and to connect the Bangalore-Mysore Infrastructure Corridor (NICE Road) with more access points.

IISc introduces e-rickshaw service on campus	sprawling 350-acre campus in the heart of Bengaluru, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) would introduce e-rickshaws.The fleet of 10 e-rickshaws will be launched on Saturday under the banner ‘Pick-E-Rick’ ahead of the Open Day celebrations scheduled later this month.IISc’s administrative officials believe e-rickshaws would bring down the use of motorised vehicles inside its campus. “The idea has been tested since last year and three rickshaws have been in use,” said a senior official of the institute. “Following the success of the idea, it would be offered full-time across the campus for easy commute.”The rickshaws could be hired by faculty, students and others visiting the campus for Rs 5 per trip per person.An official release from the institute stated that the rickshaws will operate on five different routes identified as purple, green, red, orange and blue by Prof Ashish Verma’s Transportation Engineering Lab at IISc.The rickshaws will be available on all days, except Sundays, between 11.30 am and 7.30 pm. Operated by Transvahan Technologies India, it will accept only digital payments. “Each way along the chosen route will cost Rs 5. Commuters must pay digitally by apps like UPI or Paytm,” the official said.	Indian Institute of Science,E-rickshaw,	 Mar 16 2019
BWSSB connection? Not interested, say residents	Sewerage (BWSSB) services are indispensable for living in the city. But people of 110 villages newly added to the BBMP beg to differ.Citizens have spurned the BWSSB’s offer of bringing them under its ambit. Of the 35,000 families, only 6,000 in 29 villages have applied for connections till date.The BWSSB has so far completed the underground drainage (UGD) work and the infrastructure is in place to provide water supply in about 29 villages.BWSSB officials said they had notified about the provision of water supply to citizens and called for their applications. The notifications were sent to people in 7 out of 29 villages in August last year, 12 received notifications in November and 10 received in January this year.But, hardly 6,000 people have showed interest in the BWSSB’s water connections, thanks to bureaucratic red-tape that accompanies any government service. And with villagers enjoying the luxury of free borewell water in some villages, there seems to be no incentive for residents to clamour for connections. Losing trustThe civic body has already trust of the residents by failing to arrange water tankers on time. “If phoned today, the BWSSB water tankers reach our houses after two days. What is the point in attending to people’s crisis but not on time? We are totally dependent on private tankers for water, who are throwing hefty prices at us,” said Shashikala from Bommanahalli area.Diwakar DV, a resident from Bellandur, said residents cannot rely on BWSSB tankers even though they are cheaper than private tankers because of irregular timings. “Many office-goers cannot depend on BWSSB tankers as they delay too much,” he said.Kempararamiah, Engineer-in-Chief, BWSSB, admitted the problem with water tanker supply. “It has not come to our notice that the tankers are not reaching the respective houses in time. I will talk to our concerned engineers in charge of this and make sure the supply is proper and on time,” he said. The BBMP said it would deploy 267 water tankers to serve villages without water supply. “We have issued a one week tender for the same. We will provide water wherever there is a need,” said Manjunath Prasad, BBMP commissioner.	BWSSB,	 Mar 16 2019

The decision to build the elevated corridor has left the city divided with pro and con debates reaching a new crescendo.Activists have alleged that the project all along its path will cut down trees, demolish heritage structures and pave the way for even more traffic in the days to come. Even though the government has conveyed that it will consider the opinion of all sections of society, the decision to float a tender unilaterally has drawn flak from various quarters.

No end to white-topping woes, RV Road works start	(Lalbagh West Gate) to Banashankari TTMC beginning today, may result in further traffic chaos.Recently, the city traffic police gave permission to the BBMP for the white-topping of the RV Road.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has advised commuters to use alternative routes to avoid traffic snarls. “Work will be taken up on one side of the metro corridor. So, traffic will be restricted to one stretch at a time,” a senior BBMP official said.“Initially, the work will start from the South End Circle side towards the Lalbagh West Gate,” the official added. Interestingly, the BBMP’s advice to use alternative roads has only added to the problems of the commuters in South Bengaluru. Already one side of the KR Road has been blocked at different stretches, thanks to white-topping.Besides, the roads passing through VV Puram have also been blocked for traffic in some of the junctions forcing the motorists to circumnavigate to reach the JC road towards Central Bengaluru. About white-toppingThe BBMP project to lay concrete roads — white-topping as it is known in official parlance — is turning into a never-ending nightmare for the citizens. In the past two years, the civic body has initiated white-topping in many stretches across the city. Work started on white-topping 94.5 km of roads in some of the city’s central areas at a cost of Rs 986 crore last year. Five months after the deadline, just 15% of the work is done. Undeterred, the BBMP is extending the project to 41 additional roads in the heart of the city and to the proposed Peripheral Ring Road.The BBMP initially planned to complete the work in nine months time. But the project was delayed due to the failure in getting permission from the traffic police. Later, BBMP started work on half the carriageway in a few stretches to make way for vehicles.

Water scarcity threatens pedestrian safety in Bellandur	in southeastern Bengaluru’s Bellandur ward, pedestrian safety for instance.In Bellandur, well-laid footpaths and pedestrian safety remain a far-fetched dream for citizens as the authorities turn a blind eye. To top it, the civic bodies are now allowing private entities to dig up existing footpaths.On Friday, a borewell was dug right in the middle of a footpath along the Kasavanahalli Road in Bellandur by a private individual. When questioned about the same, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) officials said the concerned individual has official permission for the same.The residents now are concerned about pedestrian safety. “Pedestrian safety has never been a matter of concern to our civic bodies. There have never been proper footpaths in Kasavanahalli. I hope the borewell will be demolished and wound up, to avoid danger especially to children,” said Latha M, a resident.“But, we have to address the water problem here. The entire ward is facing water scarcity. Everybody needs water here. The BWSSB and BBMP should take the problem seriously,” she added.One of the apartments in Kasavanahalli had no water for almost 20 hours on Friday. “SJR Verity Apartment residents were inconvenienced and distressed. It affected so many office-goers and children who had to attend schools. Depending on the borewell is a joke now. All borewells have been depleted here. We are relying on water tankers.There are many such apartments in Bellandur that are suffering from water shortage,” said an activist from Bellandur who didn’t wish to be quoted. According to the residents, as many as 200 apartments in Bellandur are devoid of BWSSB’s Cauvery water supply, while a few are already in the process of receiving the supply. They say they have recently written a letter to the BWSSB chairman and are awaiting action.	water shortage,BBMP,Bellandur,Bengaluru,BWSSB,	 Mar 11 2019
No adequate lighting in city bus shelters	of illumination in bus shelters, the Mayor on Thursday directed the traffic engineering cell to fix the lights in all the BBMP bus shelters.Arthur Solomon, a civic activist had complained to the Mayor and senior BBMP officials about insufficient lighting at bus shelters, raising a major safety concern. “Apart from the shelters along the Krumbigal Road, bus shelters in the city seldom have proper lighting. The passengers, especially women and senior citizens, feel unsafe,” said Arthur Solomon.The city has 8,000 bus stops and only 2,000 stops have shelters. The shelters lack amenities for passengers using public transport. “After I have complained to the BBMP, the Mayor has directed the traffic engineering cell to take immediate action and has alerted the concerned contractors to fix the lights. If they fail, they will be blacklisted,” he added.Meanwhile, DH accessed the mayor’s order. “It is found that most bus shelters in BBMP limits lack lighting facilities. These shelters should be lit up immediately. Stern action will be taken against the concerned officials who fail to fix the problem,” it said.Residents complain most bus shelters have turned into advertisement panels, with no space even to display the name of the bus stop. The lighting used is exclusively for advertisements.“The bus shelter in Malleswaram 18th Cross is so scary due to the lack of lighting facilities. The street light there is not working too,” said Rashmi Muralidhar, a Malleswaram resident.The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has 2,212 designated bus shelters. The BBMP had called tenders for 1,200 shelters, to be built under the public-private partnership (PPP) model.	Bengaluru,BBMP,bus shelters,	 Mar 11 2019
KSPCB directs BBMP to check road dust	city, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) has directed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to come up with measures to reduce the amount of dust kicked up on the roads.The directions have come after Chief Secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar took note of the issue at the committee meeting held last week.“We have asked the BBMP to rein in the road dust problem. Though construction is going on everywhere and it is the hot and dry season, special care needs to be taken,” Manoj Kumar, KSPCB member secretary told DH.“Construction works like flyovers and white-topping are going on everywhere. As per procedures, roads around areas where construction is going on should be sprinkled with water at least twice a day to settle the road dust. Besides, the BBMP should also ensure roads are swept, but none of this is happening,” pointed out another KSPCB official.According to the KSPCB, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Jayanagar, a residential area, on March 5 was 136 and particulate matter (PM 2.5) was 143 parts per milligram (ug/m3). At Nimhans, AQI was 106 and PM 2.5 was 122. As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the standard PM 2.5 value is 60 ug/m3 for 24 hours. CPCB analysis up to 4 pm on March 6, showed AQI as 116.Bengalureans are demanding measures to minimise road dust. Commuters can be seen moving around wearing masks. Paediatricians and pulmonologists say patients with respiratory problems and infections have increased.“Bengaluru is known as the Asthma capital and the number of cases are increasing. It is difficult to put a specific number on the number of patients. But apart from children, the cases of women coming with breathing problems are on the rise. We are advising them to wear masks and change their travel timings,” said Vanitha G, a pulmonologist.However, Sarfaraz Khan, BBMP joint commissioner, solid waste management, said the civic body is procuring 34 mechanical sweepers. At present, there are eight.Another BBMP engineer blamed the summer for the water crises.“Tankers are costly. So, we are unable to water the roads under repair. People will have to cooperate,” he said.	Karnataka State Pollution Control Board,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,	 Mar 10 2019
Mahadevapura residents hit by water shortage	seems to be in the thick of it, though summer has just set in. Being the biggest tech corridor in the city has made the area highly vulnerable. And there is no better illustration of this than a startling statistic: Over 70% of the population in the zone depend on water tankers, according a citizen survey conducted on Facebook. The survey shows that 25% of people do not have borewells and only 5% have adequate Cauvery water supply.Residents said that supply of Cauvery water had been reduced over the past few days, leading to high dependence on water tankers. But the situation is good news for water tanker mafia, which is cashing in on the situation by charging exorbitant rates.“We are facing a severe crisis in Bellandur. Only 55% of our water needs are being met here. This week, Cauvery water has reduced drastically and now tankers are blackmailing us and not supplying water. Besides, they are demanding more money,” a resident said.Another resident alleged that the BWSSB and the water tankers were hand in glove. “There are Cauvery lines everywhere, but no water has been released by the municipality yet. Looks like the BWSSB and water tanker suppliers are hand in glove. We are not even getting 10 litres per day per family despite paying a lot to get Cauvery connection,” said Prasad Kumar, a Whitefield resident.The residents said borewells along the kaluve on the north side were dry as Varthur lake water was flowing out more in the south weir. The borewell valve handlers addressed this issue with the ward committee members during the last committee meeting.Local MLA Aravind Limbavali had demanded more funds to solve drinking water problems in his constituency at the Belagavi Session, as the Rs 25 lakhs announced by the government was not sufficient.Officials said they were doing their best to solve the problem. “We have been digging borewells wherever necessary with funds released by the government. Despite this, sometimes there is a shortage of water during summers. It is also the responsibility of the BWSSB to complete the Cauvery water supply connections in all 110 villages in the city,” said R L Parameshwaraiah Chief Engineer, Mahadevapura.	water shortage,Mahadevapura,	 Mar 09 2019
Steel flyover to be back in concrete avatar	steel flyover project from Chalukya Circle (Basaveshwara Circle) to Hebbal, is set to resurrect it by going in for a concrete flyover instead of steel. A detailed project report (DPR) for the flyover is likely to be ready within two weeks.In conversation with DH on Thursday, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara said he has told officials “to do away with steel” which had led to a controversy.“The reason for choosing steel was that the foundation of the pillars need not go as deep as concrete and hence, would take less time to build. I have instructed officials to prepare a DPR for a concrete bridge and it will be ready in two weeks,” he said.The project had faced public opposition when it was proposed by the previous Congress government due to its impact on the environment. According to documents, 812 trees have to make way for the bridge and only 56 of them can be transplanted.Asked about concerns of the activists, Parameshwara said the government will compensate for the loss of greenery by planting more trees in the coming days.“Trees have to be cut along the stretch and there is no alternative. Tenders will be called to plant one lakh saplings ahead of June. We are also mulling to incentivise tree planting by the general public,” he said.The proposal is likely to rankle civil society which launched a movement against the project.When asked about the claims that the flyover was not sustainable, the deputy chief minister promised that the DPR will be placed before the public.“We will place the project report in public domain. The suggestions by the public will be considered before a decision is made,” he said.According to the previous DPR, the work comprised the main flyover of 6.68 km as well as eight ramps of about 4.5 km.It also proposed three underpasses at Chalukya junction, Millers Road and Cunningham Road.	"Basaveshwara Circle,steel flyover,The state government, which faced stiff opposition to its steel flyover project from Chalukya Circle (Basaveshwara Circle) to Hebbal, is set to resurrect it by going in for a concrete flyover instead of steel. A detailed project report (DPR) for the flyover is likely to be ready within two weeks.
In conversation with DH on Thursday, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara said he has told officials “to do away with steel” which had led to a controversy.
“The reason for choosing steel was that the foundation of the pillars need not go as deep as concrete and hence, would take less time to build. I have instructed officials to prepare a DPR for a concrete bridge and it will be ready in two weeks,” he said.
The project had faced public opposition when it was proposed by the previous Congress government due to its impact on the environment. According to documents, 812 trees have to make way for the bridge and only 56 of them can be transplanted.
Asked about concerns of the activists, Parameshwara said the government will compensate for the loss of greenery by planting more trees in the coming days.
“Trees have to be cut along the stretch and there is no alternative. Tenders will be called to plant one lakh saplings ahead of June. We are also mulling to incentivise tree planting by the general public,” he said.
The proposal is likely to rankle civil society which launched a movement against the project.
When asked about the claims that the flyover was not sustainable, the deputy chief minister promised that the DPR will be placed before the public.
“We will place the project report in public domain. The suggestions by the public will be considered before a decision is made,” he said.
According to the previous DPR, the work comprised the main flyover of 6.68 km as well as eight ramps of about 4.5 km.

Srirampuram underpass to open after 10-yr delay	project on time. There are several instances of projects delayed for 4-5 years.Here is a project which was delayed nearly for 10 years after it was announced.The railway underpass at Srirampuram that connects Malleswaram to Rajajinagar, Gayatrinagar and Srirampuram is all set to be thrown open for public use.The project was planned in order to ease traffic along the existing old and narrow underpass. However, it was delayed for almost 10 years due to land litigations.“The land acquisition process was delayed as there were three stake holders — Mantri Developers, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and South Western Railways (SWR). In 2007, when the project was launched, the new underpass was planned on the northern side, but to accommodate the metro pillar, SWR changed the location of the underpass to the south. But, the site belonged to the Mantri group. After several consultations, the group agreed to lay a road for public through their land, and the project kick-started,” a BBMP engineer on the spot told DH.The delay in the project has irked a lot of residents in the surrounding areas, as the narrow underpass would lead to traffic jams, especially during peak hours.“The movement of heavy transport vehicles are causing endless traffic jams in the locality. Now, with the new underpass, we can expect smooth traffic,” Chengappa, a resident said.The residents, meanwhile, are expecting a change in the traffic pattern in the locality after the inauguration of the new underpass. Traffic police said the underpass is in the wrong place and they are planning to redesign the flow of traffic in the area.“If the underpass was on the northern side, then we wouldn’t worry. But, now we have to redesign the movement of vehicles towards the Malleswaram railway station. We cannot make the commuters go through the new underpass, take a U-turn, and then come back from the old underpass to take a left. We will come up with a new arrangement before the inauguration of the new underpass,” a senior traffic police officer said.	BBMP,Srirampuram,Underpass,	 Mar 08 2019
Residents fume over Cauvery water delay	Bommanahalli zone are angry over the BWSSB’s delay in finishing the pipeline work.Under the Cauvery water supply scheme 5, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) started laying pipelines at various layouts in Bommanahalli zone in South-East Bengaluru two years ago.Now, the unending work has exasperated the residents as the dugout roads to lay pipelines are causing disruption of traffic and kicking up dust. BWSSB officials, meanwhile, cited lack of funds and irregular labourers for the delay.Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara laid the foundation for the supply of Cauvery water from BWSSB at Uttarahalli, Vasanthpur, Yalchenhenahalli, Thippasandra, Gudigere and Begur wards in Bommanahalli on Wednesday.He was rather taken aback by the fact that though the construction of ground level storage tank in Uttarahalli side has been completed, the inauguration is yet to happen.“If the drinking water project is shut down, the masses will be affected. Interest on the loan will also increase as there is no implementation for two years. All of this burdens the government,” said Parameshwara.“Water supply will be provided to 17 villages in Uttarahalli,” he added. 15,000 connections were given for this purpose, he said.However, the residents of Bommanahalli expressed their dissatisfaction about the project.“Cauvery water supply is needed at all wards of Bommanahalli. There is a huge dependence on water tankers at the moment. All the borewells have been depleted. Most of the houses and apartments are not eligible for the supply of water under the project. The government should do something for them as well,” said K Prakash, president, Beautiful Begur Federation.“Around 10,000 people are dependent on Cauvery water in Bommanahalli. What we receive from water tankers is impure. My children are falling sick after drinking the water from the tankers, despite having water filters at home. We need Cauvery water soon,” said Satyendra Khare, a resident of Begur.	BWSSB,Cauvery water,Bommanhalli,	 Mar 08 2019
Govt imposing elevated corridor on city: Experts	city’s environment while the procedure adopted by the government to push for the project violates the Constitution, experts said on Wednesday.Former Environment Secretary Yellappa Reddy, chairman of the Bangalore Environment Trust, said the government will do irreparable damage to the city’s crumbling ecosystem if it were to cut down 3,600 trees for the proposed project.“The government is imposing a project on people without asking them whether they really need it. Finally, it is we the public who have to deal with the ill effects of such unsustainable works,” he said.Reddy said the government’s job was to conduct wider public consultations and commission studies to find out a solution for traffic congestion.National Law School of India University professor M K Ramesh said the tender process violates the principles laid down in the 73rd and 74th amendment of the Constitution.“It is a blunder that the BBMP, the local governing body, has been kept out of the loop. It is not just a procedural error. A statutory body can’t bypass a constitutional body,” he said.According to Ramesh, contrary to the assumption of the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL), officials can’t skip public consultation before going ahead with a project. He cited a 2010 judgment of the Karnataka High Court to state the process was mandatory.“Also, officials have gone on record stating they have consulted departments and hence there was no need to consult the public. But departments are not stakeholders. How can the government equate itself to stakeholders?” he asked.Meanwhile, on a sarcastic note, Bengaluru Rural parliamentarian D K Suresh on Wednesday said the government must build an elevated road on Magadi Road instead, which will ensure both Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy and PWD minister H D Revanna reach Hassan faster.Speaking at the foundation laying ceremony to rejuvenate the Thippagondanahalli Reservoir in Ramanagara district, D K Suresh said: “An elevated corridor must be built between Summanahalli Junction and NICE junction (Magadi Road). The CM and the PWD minister perhaps could allocate funds for the project as well. If the corridor is built, Hassan can be reached faster.”	road,elevated corridor,Bengaluru,	 Mar 07 2019
New train to Delhi on Kolar route launched	have another train, which will run via Chikballapur, Kolar and Katpadi and also connect Renigunta, thereby benefiting Tirumala devotees.Union Minister D V Sadananda Gowda and Bengaluru Central MP P C Mohan flagged off the inaugural run of the Yeshwantpur-Hazrat Nizamuddin Weekly Express at Yeshwantpur on Tuesday.Railway officials said the date for regular services will be announced shortly. The timetable will also be finalised in the coming days, they said.Former railway minister K H Muniyappa said the train will benefit thousands of people travelling from Chikballapur, Kolar and Bangarpet. The train has a stop in Renigunta, which will help those travelling to Tirupati.‘Suburban rail soon’Mohan said the Centre had taken a proactive approach to clear all the hurdles for the suburban rail. “Even the 19 conditions put forth by the state government, which had become a problem, are now cleared. We hope the foundation stone will be laid within a week,” he said.	train,Bengaluru,Delhi,	 Mar 06 2019
Civic body to upgrade digital infrastructure	Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will set up an Information Storage Retrieval and Management System. The system will store documents and backup data on various services of the civic body.BBMP has earmarked Rs 7.50 crore in the budget for upgrading digital infrastructure. According to the proposal prepared by the civic body the digitisation of various departments that provide services, a good digital communication network, and a robust computing platform are important and rather urgent requirements for an organisation like the BBMP, where dependency on IT applications is growing.“The information from various applications is stored at the data centre which is hosted at the BBMP IPP Centre, Malleswaram. BBMP also has a mini data centre which is located at the head office in NR Square. The storage and backup of this information are critical for BBMP,” states the proposal.“For a developing Bengaluru, with growth comes a higher level of responsibility towards providing services to the citizens. BBMP must have an advanced data centre to store information,” said an official from the IT department. “Soon, the system will be upgraded in the IPP Centre and the BBMP head office. The E-Office software will be utilised for the faster processing of files in all the offices of the BBMP,” he added.The officials hope the upgradation of the data centre and E-Office will be implemented in another three to five months.

Smart Variable Messaging Systems to help city traffic	is set to install Smart Variable Messaging Systems (SVMS) in arterial, sub-arterial and other major roads in the city.The SVMS act as an information centre for vehicle users providing live traffic updates, journey time, distances, traffic density, alternative routes, weather and emergency directions. The SVMS project will be taken up with the help of state government funds, at a cost of Rs 50 crore.“SVMS will provide real-time traffic updates and will suggest alternative routes with minimum traffic density. The state government will fund the project through BBMP,” said an at the Traffic Engineering Cell.In 2010, Bengaluru traffic police installed 20 LED signboards under the B-Track project which have not been upgraded since. In September 2019, for the first time, the state government installed SVMS in Mysuru making it the first city in Karnataka to have such a system. “The BBMP has called for a Detailed Project Report. Signboards will be set up along high-density corridors,” the official added.VVIP movement, traffic norms, traffic diversions, temperature, highway patrols, nearest fire station and ambulance availability will be displayed. “SVMS will measure 2.5×5 feet, with a colourful display unlike LED signages. The message will be visible to motorists at least from a distance of 100 meters. Kannada and English will be the languages,” said the official.	BBMP,Bengaluru,traffic,SVMS,	 Mar 05 2019
Bengaluru's toxic air a lab for dust-eating machines	be the main causes of pollution in the city, fine dust particles, measuring less than 2.5 micrometres, have now turned out to be the latest threat.With this, the city has become a laboratory for outdoor air filter companies to test their ‘Dust Eater’ machines.Fitted with sensors and filters capable of detecting fine dust particles, these filter cubes suck the ambient air and retain fine dust and other harmful substances while releasing fresh air back into the environment.Capable of functioning in all weather conditions, these dust eaters are designed to function according to the intensity of the fine dust particles, thus saving on energy as well, according to Harsha Prakash Gowda, an expert on fine dust eater project.Experts have been studying the efficacy of the machines.While Germany-based Mann Hummel had first installed a stationary filter cube dust eater in association with the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in Cubbon Park and in Peenya Industrial Area, another firm in association with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) set up one at the busy Hudson Circle.The companies have also been approached by international schools and IT firms to set up these fine dust eaters on their premises.“Fine dust is a problem in urban areas due to slow moving heavy traffic. According to KSPCB data, a whopping 62% of fine dust is due to road traffic and emission. Of the 62%, exhaust emission contributes only 30% and the rest comes from brake dust, tyre and asphalt abrasion. These are perhaps split-second action but trigger a lot of PM 2.5. Largely invisible, it gets easily absorbed into lungs and blood,” says Pradeep Randhawa, vice president and MD of Mann Hummell.The firm’s dust eater machine is on trial at an international school in Delhi where air flow in the children’s play area is being purified.Officials have also been interacting with the state government and transport department for installation of these machines in outdoor ambiance. The dust eater has also been designed to absorb nitrogen dioxide NO2. Dr Rahul S Patil, consultant cardiologist and head of the Project Premature Coronary Artery Disease (PCAD) at Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research said, “Air pollution is one of the causes for heart attacks at the young age. Prolonged exposure to vehicle emission impacts the heart according to our study. In those who are exposed to pollution like traffic police and drivers, the blood is hyper viscous and unable to flow freely through arteries. Such patients reveal abnormal fluctuation in their blood pressure and heart rate causing heart attacks.”	Air Pollution,dust,	 Mar 05 2019
KRDCL to rework corridor alignment	the alignment to the 96-kilometre elevated corridor that would link it with other modes of transport at 53 intersections.The agency has embarked on the project after a recent cabinet meeting that gave Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy a free hand to decide on the elevated corridors.“The government has asked us to take a relook at the project,” a KRDCL source said. “It was pointed out that around Rs 50,000 crore is lost in traffic junctions, where each citizen waits for at least two minutes at each signal. There are at least 120 traffic signals in the city.”Sources added that a meeting was held following the cabinet decision where the decision to revisit the project was taken. “We’re taking a relook since the prime objection of people is that elevated corridors focus on road commuters. It was also decided to include the Chalukya Circle-Hebbal loop into the project,” the source added.Giving the example of Electronics City, they said: “The metro is extending till there and there’s also a major bus stand. The alignment should be made in such a way that the commuter using the elevated corridor can park his vehicle and immediately take any public mode of transport.”Similar is the case with Mysuru Road, where again commuters should be able to hop on to the public transport of their choice once they get off the elevated corridor. In places like the Vidhana Soudha metro station, they should be able to get signal-free connectivity once they deboard the train.The corridor should have up and down ramps that seamlessly link places like the Mysuru Road bus terminal with Nice Corridor and the metro station, something important for long-distance travel.

KRDCL invites elevated corridor tender sans Cabinet nod	was pushed to the backburner, with the cabinet asking the chief minister to decide, it has seen a dramatic revival.The Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) is taking the project forward by inviting tenders. It has released advertisements to this effect. KRDCL has broken the project into three packages on two, three, four and six lanes. The packages will be the north-south corridor from Baptist Hospital to JC Nagar, JC Nagar to Shantinagar and Shantinagar to Central Silk Board.While the project’s total length is 96 km, tenders have been called for 22.22 km for three packages of 6.15 km, 8.75 km and 7.22 km. The tender bid is for a three-year project and 10-year maintenance period.KRDCL officials said they were acting on government’s orders. Tenders have been called after the project report had been tabled before the government, they said.Citizens and experts have raised serious objections. “How could they call for tenders when the project is not cleared by the cabinet and placed before people for opinions?” asked Ashish Verma, associate professor, Centre for Infrastructure Sustainable Transportation and Urban Planning (Cistup), IISc.“All projects should go through due procedures, including public consultation. The government is repeating the mistake it did on the steel flyover,” Verma added.He said the KRDCL did not obtain environmental clearances for the project. Given its size, it should have been thoroughly studied. But the government is projecting the elevated corridor as the ultimate solution. It has failed to do a study or released a report on its feasibility in terms of the suburban railway, metro, BRTS (Bus Rapid Transit System) or other options.Ironically, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara met citizens, experts and lawmakers over the past few weeks. He also assured that a public meeting would be held, while now it appears that the government is going ahead with the tender process.	elevated corridor,KRDCL,	 Mar 04 2019
Metro in Anjanapura by Aug 2020	Kanakapura Road. The BMRCL on Sunday announced that track-laying work was in progress for the extended metro line from Yelachenahalli to Anjanapura under Phase 2.The BMRCL said track-laying work will be completed by October and several works on the Reach 4 extension will be taken up in the coming days to ensure the opening of the stretch to the public by August 2020. “The BMRCL is planning to open this line by August 2020,” the release said.The 6.05-km extension from Yelachenahalli to Anjanapura Township will help thousands of travellers, who now get down at Yelahchenahalli and wait for buses at crowded junctions to travel further. The line will have five stations, including Vajrahalli, Talaghattapura and Anjanapura.The BMRCL is also making arrangements to begin track-laying work on Mysore Road-Kengeri section (Reach 2 extension) by the end of March. The work is likely to be completed by December, the release said.In a release, the corporation said that the track-laying contract has been awarded to Texmaco Rail and Engineering Limited, a New Delhi-based company, at an approximate value of Rs 530 crore. The work includes laying of tracks in Phase 2 main lines and all depots.	Namma Metro,BMRCL,Anjanapura,	 Mar 04 2019
Work on longest Metro tunnel to begin soon	and Nagavara — to be the longest such structure in the state — seems to have got a head start with officials signing contract for two packages.The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) announced on its website that work on two of the four packages has been assigned to L&T Limited. The Vellara-Shivajinagar package will be built at a cost of Rs 1,329.14 crore while the cost of Shivajinagar-Tannery Road has been finalised at Rs 1,299 crore.The previous tenders for the 13.7-km tunnel section, split into four packages, were cancelled after the lowest bidders quoted about 70% more than the estimated project cost. The re-tendering seems to have saved a lot of money. The agreement finalised on Thursday shows the cost of the two packages has gone up slightly, by about 17.5%.Asked about the time required for starting the work on the ground, BMRCL Chief Public Relations Officer B L Yashavanth Chavan said it depends on several factors. “The contractor will have a 42-month deadline from the day of issuing the letter of interest. He has to make preliminary studies and mobilise the resources for the execution of the project,” he said.The tenders for two more packages — Dairy Circle to Langford Town and Tannery Road to Nagawara — have March 21 as deadline for bid submission. Officials said it may take about five months for awarding the contract.The underground section poses a big challenge as unpredictable rock formation and other geological conditions make the work difficult. Three of the four packages have two tunnel boring machines (TBM) each while the fourth one will have three machines to finish the task faster.The cancellation of tender and re-tendering process has delayed the work by a year. Officials last year planned to reduce the tunnel section to 5 km after seeing the exorbitant cost but later returned to the original plan. With the latest bids, the corporation has ensured that it won’t get a raw deal.	Namma Metro,	 Mar 02 2019
Upgraded Church Street completes one year	Street in the city’s Central Business District completed one year on Friday. Although the road with a cobble-stone pathway has turned a model for Brigade Road and Commercial Street to emulate, grey areas of concern remain.Walkers, particularly the youth, are flocking to the street in big numbers. After over an year of losses due to construction, business is picking up for the scores of eateries, book shops and other outlets along the road. But parking issues remain. So does vehicular traffic and garbage management.Pedestrians have complained about overspeeding cars and motorcyclists, haphazard parking and garbage bins left uncleared for days. The one-way rule is violated with contempt with no traffic police in sight, particularly so after 11 pm.The parking regulations, proposed when the upgraded road was inaugurated a year ago, are still nowhere in place. It was proposed that the street be closed for entry of vehicles from 12 noon to 12 midnight.The road’s designer and architect, Naresh Narasimhan, had suggested that no vehicles be allowed after 12 noon from the Brigade Road side. This, he says, could be achieved by positioning manned boom barriers near the Starbucks outlet.A few critics had questioned the project’s construction quality. But Narasimhan counters this: “Only four out of 1,45,000 cobblestones laid on the road had come out.” The vehicular speed limit is 10 kmph. There is no policing or enforcement. For pedestrians though, the positives have been clear: absence of obstructions, quick draining of stormwater, well-planned underground utilities that negate the need for any road-digging and good lighting. Yet, many have articulated the need for better bins and regular maintenance.The road’s architects had suggested that the tertiary treated water from the Cubbon Park sewage treatment plant could be used to wash the road regularly. Parking could also be streamlined with about 300 paid car parking slots coming up at a new commercial complex at the street’s junction with Museum Road.Under a Rs 9-crore upgrade, Church Street had a total makeover. The British era underground utility were completely replaced, the lanes were made uniform with granite cobblestones and the footpath rendered pedestrian-friendly. The state government recently made a budgetary announcement that this model will be replicated on Brigade Road and Commercial Street.	Church Street,	 Mar 02 2019
Institute offers solution to metro tunneling problems	during the tunnel construction for Namma Metro Phase 1. Now, this can be avoided with the help of advanced seismic tomography developed by the National Institute of Rock Mechanics (NIRM).Engineers from Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) urged the NIRM to come up with a technology that can help in understanding underground rock formations in the built-up surface areas in Phase 2.NIRM director H S Venkatesh said it was the only institute in India with a specialised geophysics engineering group that can provide the precise information on the location and size of the boulder. “Several years of experience has helped the team of experts to come up with sophisticated technology that can help avoid delay in projects,” he said.BMRCL officials said while huge boulders pose a challenge in tunnelling work, tunnel boring machines (TBM) can cut through them in a time-consuming process. Smaller boulders of 3-5 metre in diameter start rotating along with the blades of the TBM, instead of getting cut.Metro engineers said the damage to the cutter-head of the Godavari TBM in April 2014 stalled the work for over a year. Importing a new cutter-head from Italy and delay in the work led to more than Rs 10 crore extra.Dr P C Jha, scientist and the head of Department of Geophysics at NIRM, said they have the technology to map the boulders. He said BMRCL contractors use borehole logs to assess the underground surface, which will not be able to map the boulder.“The seismic refraction study, done from the surface, can tell the type of the rock and its location within 20-metre reach. However, if a free surface is not available along the alignment, NIRM’s seismic tomography survey (which is done from boreholes) can provide a full projection of the size of the boulder besides the usual information. Though it is 4-5 times costlier than the surface survey, it is negligible considering the cost of delay,” he said.	Namma Metro,BMRCL,	 Feb 21 2019

'Bengaluru has rules but no will to manage waste'	"but comes last in enforcing them, experts said on Sunday. Bengaluru is the only city in India to have rules and laws on garbage disposal but there is no one to speak on how they should be implemented. As a result, only half of the garbage generated in the city is scientifically managed, said Shekar Prabhakar, Managing Director, Hasiru Dala Innovations Private Limited, a waste management services enterprise. He was speaking at a day-long conference on 'Exploring the challenges cities face on the road to resilience-discussing the future of Bangalore'. ""Will Bengaluru's burgeoning air and water problem force the city into a Bangkok-like shutdown,"" Divya Narayan of Jhatkaa.org asked. She said waste generators, collectors and the government must work together, but that was not happening. ""Bengaluru is the worst in garbage management,"" panellists said. Malini Parmar, the co-founder of Stonesoup, said the High Court of Karnataka's decision to lay down solid waste management rules for Bengaluru had prompted 15 other Indian cities to voluntarily start the two-bin one-bag method. While other Indian cities have been following the prescribed colour code for bins, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) keeps changing the colour code of bins (red, blue and green), she said. Citing the example of Church Street, Jaideep Singh, co-founder, Ambee, a start-up, said having two bins for wet and dry waste was of no help as their content was the same. ""This is because there is no clear demarcation of which is for what,"" he added. Singh linked improper waste management to the rising cases of garbage burning. ""This has increased the number of toxins in the air, leading to more air pollution and more health problems. In cities like Bangkok, there is a shutdown when AQI (air quality index) increases the 100 threshold but that's not the case in any Indian city,"" he noted."	Garbage,	 Feb 18 2019

Sirsi Circle flyover one side opens today: BBMP	open for traffic from Friday evening.After a delay of three days, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials have said the road from Town Hall towards Mysuru Road will be open for commuters from Friday evening onwards.The BBMP had undertaken the asphalting work of the flyover and the work on this route had begun during the end of December last year. The traffic from Town Hall was diverted to alternate routes via KR Market.“The asphalting work from Town Hall towards Mysuru Road is completed and we will open the road for traffic from Friday evening,” said K T Nagaraj, chief engineer, road infrastructure, projects, BBMP.He also said that the traffic from the other side of the flyover, from Mysuru Road towards Town Hall, will be shut as they would take up the repair work on that side.“The entire project is expected to be completed in a month’s time,” he said.This time, the civic body is using a new method of asphalting called 'asphalto seal pad' for the road, which not only increases durability, but also consumes less time. A similar method was adopted for asphalting Richmond Circle flyover.	Sirsi Circle flyover,BBMP,	 Feb 08 2019
Now, a 'dust eater' in Cubbon Park	in ambient air and releases purified air.The device comprises three big blocks with air filters, called Filter Cubes, and have been installed by Mann+Hummel, a German multinational filtration expert, in coordination with the Horticulture Department. The device is located near the entrance to the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association.The Filter Cubes were installed in November on a pilot basis and has generated curiosity among officials from the pollution control boards of Karnataka and other states.Recently, West Bengal Pollution Control Board Chairman Dr Kalyan Rudra visited the site to take notes. They have sought for analysis reports and verification of data.While explaining about the device, Harsha Prakash Gowda, expert Fine Dust Eater, Mann+Hummel, said the device is attached to sensors. Once the level of particulate matter in the atmosphere crosses 100 micrograms per metre cube (prescribed highest value by CPCB), the machines will switch on and start to suck in ambient air, purify the PM 10 and 2.5 by 60-70% and release it back into the atmosphere.Each block has pre-filters, main filters and fans to suck the air and release it. The complete instrument is equipped to clean 10,000-metre cube of air per hour. It runs on electricity and the sensors are active between 8 am and 8 pm. They are synced with the opening and closing of the Cubbon Park gates.Varadharajan B, Lead Engineer, Simulation, Mann+Hummel, said the instrument also analyses data which has been sent for analysis to ascertain the efficiency and air quality. The report will be released only after it is verified.Varadharajan said average air pollution even at Cubbon Park is of PM 10 and 2.5 is around 130- 150 micrograms per metre cube on any given day.A N Yellappa Reddy, expert committee member, Horticulture Department, said that it was a common notion that air quality is good in Cubbon Park. But the fact is that it is least studied and it has a high level of particulate matter trapped in it. This is the reason behind the department agreeing for a detailed study.Manoj Kumar, KSPCB member secretary, said, the instrument is good, but test results have to be checked.

600 more toilets soon in the city	Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has decided to build more than 600 public toilets across the city before Gandhi Jayanthi.The Centre has granted Rs 5 crore under the Swachh Bharat Mission programme to construct community toilets, E-toilets and public toilets in all eight zones. According to the guideline set by mission, there should be a community toilet in every 500 metres.A BBMP officer said: “The BBMP has identified the places to build the toilets. We have received around Rs 5 crore from the Centre and the BBMP will sanction remaining funds.”“The work will begin soon after the tender process is completed. We have set October 2 as the deadline to complete the work,” he added.Till date, the civic body has constructed only 479 toilets across the city. According to the norms laid by the Swachh Bharat Mission, the civic body has to build at least two toilets for the population of 100 male and 100 female and one toilet in seven-kilometre radius.In 2018, Swachh Survekshan ranking, Bengaluru had got 216 ranking which had not only slid further down the Swachh Bharat Survekshan rankings but also fared poorly compared to most other Metros in the country.Another BBMP official said, “As we have to improve our rating in the Swachh Bharat Survekshan rankings, we are building toilets to end open urination in the city.”	Bengaluru,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,public toilets,	 Feb 04 2019

Suburban rail project put on backburner	the expectations of the suburban rail project have proved to be nothing more than a set of empty promises as the Union government has put the project on the backburner.The interim Budget presented by Piyush Goyal has allocated Rs 10 crore for the Rs 17,000 crore project during the financial year 2019-20, which eliminates the possibility of any work happening for the next year.In December 2018, Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy had promised to lay the foundation stone for the project after meeting Piyush Goyal in Delhi. “The railway minister promised to take the matter to Niti Ayog for its approval. The minister also assured us of allocating some money for the project in the Union Budget,” he had said on December 27.Sources in the railways, however, noted that the state government’s conditions for approving the draft feasibility report for the project has put off the momentum gained over the last few months.“There was an expectation among the senior officials that the project would take off with a good allocation in the Union Budget. However, the state government’s conditions in the face of railways’ expectation of an unconditional approval, complicated the situation,” sources in the railways said.Activists said it was unfortunate that two years after the state and Union governments signed a memorandum of understanding to build suburban rail network, they have been only finding more reasons to delay the project.Citizens for Bengaluru’s Srinivas Alavilli said the paltry allocation shows the continued apathy of the governments towards a much-needed project. “The gap between Rs 10 crore and the project cost of Rs 17,000 crore is a direct reflection of the difference between the government’s response and people’s expectation,” he said.Urban Transport Sanjeev Dyamannavar said suburban project missed a big momentum and the allied works needed more funds. “Funds have been allocated for doubling Byappanahalli-Hosur and Yashwantpur-Channasandra lines. However, more funds were needed for quadrupling Cantonment-Whitefield section. It is disappointing that automatic signalling and level crossing elimination in Bengaluru division has not been given priority,” he said.	suburban rail project,Bengaluru,	 Feb 02 2019
‘Before investing find cause of deterioration of lakes’	a fault in decision making by policymakers in investing crores of money on the rejuvenation of lakes without finding out the exact reason for their deterioration.Releasing the book ‘India’s Water Futures’ in Bengaluru on Friday, the experts discussed the skewed decisions of policymakers about rejuvenating the waterbodies. The book portrays the emergent ideas and pathways leading to solving the problems of water in the country.A panel discussion was led by Himanshu Upadhyaya, faculty at Azim Premji University, Sharachchandra Lele, noted writer and others, including the editors and the writers of the book.Referring to the Bellandur Lake, Lele said the government needs to think in various dimensions before investing money on the lake’s rejuvenation. “One lake is rejuvenated by desilting it, beautifying it, and reducing the contamination by bypassing the sewage. And if every lake is rejuvenated this way, where will the residue of the desilt go? And where will the bypassed sewage go? “ he asked.The experts also said if there is some depletion in water in a particular river at a particular place, the climate change is blamed but that’s not what it is.“The groundwater contributes to the flow of water in rivers. There is a scientific interlinking between the flow of water in the river and the groundwater. The water in rivers generally deplete due to excessive groundwater pumping and planting more water-dependent trees like eucalyptus. There are many more factors like this,” added another expert.

NGT orders closure of Graphite India	closure order on Graphite India. With this, the 20-year-old legal battle of Whitefield residents, against the polluting Graphite India Limited along the Whitefield Road, has borne fruit.In the hearing on Thursday before the principal bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) comprising Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, Chairperson, Justice S P Wangdi, Judicial member, Justice K Ramakrishnan, Judicial member, Nagin Nanda, Expert member, the 2012 closure order by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) was restored.The NGT has further issued directions to constitute a joint committee comprising representatives of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the KSPCB and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to carry out stack monitoring and ambient air monitoring of the factory, and the surrounding area by installing monitoring stations in 10 different locations. The NGT has also ordered to carry out a study on source apportionment of the pollution sources.The entire study is to be conducted within two months, with the KSPCB as the nodal agency. The report on the same should be submitted to the NGT thereafter.The NGT order comes after the apex Court had fixed a penalty of Rs 50 lakh on Graphite India on October 30 2018, as per the ‘polluters pay’ principle.“Residents around the Graphite India factory are super elated to hear that the NGT has quashed the Karnataka State Appellate Authority order of 2012, which allowed Graphite India to continue operation of the factory. The NGT has restored KSPCB's closure order of 2012. KSPCB should now move forward to implement the order,” said Zibi Jamal of Whitefield Rising.“Whitefield Rising taking up the cause in the middle of 2018 gave us much needed support. The case in the Supreme Court and recognition of Graphite India as a polluter under the 'polluters pay' principle gave much strength to the cause,” said Nivedita Gouda, a Whitefield resident.“It all started with a bunch of mothers who were worried about their children and elders inhaling the polluted air back in 2009. Our persistent complaints to the KSPCB and banding together with other residents who raised similar complaints led to the KSPCB finally issuing the closure order in 2012. Our hopes took a dent when the Appellate Authority overturned the closure order, granted Graphite India the stay and allowed them to operate. But we collected evidence, along with research papers on the effects of graphite pollution and built our case before the NGT and appealed to the court to uphold the closure,” added Gouda.

BBMP to set up a shelter home for transgenders	"Palike (BBMP) is planning to construct a shelter for the homeless transgenders in the city. According to the BBMP's estimate, there are about 15,000-20,000 transgenders spread across Bengaluru. Many of them are in fact homeless.""A shelter home will be built near the BBMP office near Upparpet police station in Gandhi Nagar. The facility would accommodate close to 100 transgenders,” said B N Jagadeesh, deputy commissioner, (welfare), BBMP. The transgenders will also be given coaching for Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Karnataka Administrative Service (KAS) entrance examinations.“We keep seeing transgenders at traffic signals. At the moment there are no shelter homes for transgenders. They do not stay put in footpaths or bus shelters. Even rental homes are denied to them. So, it is important to provide shelters,” the deputy commissioner said.The BBMP is not only providing the shelter but will empower the transgenders with access to vocational training as well.“The roof of the proposed shelter house will be utilised to provide training to the transgenders so that they can learn new skills. We will be providing tailoring, candle making, computer, driving and gardening courses,” added Jagadeesh.Randeep D, additional commissioner (admin), BBMP, said the civic body will be associating with non-governmental organisations to identify the homeless transgenders in Bengaluru. Several organisations including Solidarity Foundation and activists such as Akkai Padmashali will be part of the identification process.Meanwhile, the BBMP is already setting up shelter homes for the urban homeless men and women.With the help of Dream India Network and Impact India Consortium, the BBMP officials are working on a project to provide shelters to the urban homeless in the city. In the survey conducted across West, South and East zones, the BBMP identified 3,991 homeless people."	shelter home,BBMP,Transgenders,	 Jan 31 2019
BBMP to set up social media grievance redressal centre	through Twitter, Facebook, e-mails and SMS to resolve civic grievances. To address people’s problems posted on social media, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has floated a tender to set up a Unified Grievance Management System (UGMS). The UGMS will be housed at the BBMP’s head office, in annexure building 2.“We have called a tender to set up a call centre too along with the UGMS. The grievances posted on social media will be directed to the concerned departments for resolution,” BBMP special commissioner Randeep told DH.In December 2018, the BBMP had called a tender to set up a 24/7 centralised command and control centre to monitor Solid Waste Management (SWM). “UGMS will be set up along with the proposed 24/7 centralised command and control centre to monitor SWM,” said Randeep.In 2017, the BMRDA (Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority) had set up a social media centre. Now though, it is being used by the city development minister, the BDA and also the BBMP.The BMRDA centre was inaugurated by former Bengaluru Development and Town Planning minister K J George. Once the BBMP’s new social media centre is completed, all the BBMP related social media complaints will be routed there.The BBMP will be spending around Rs 5.9 crore to set up the state-of-the-art SWM command centre and the social media centre. The proposal for the social media facility was put forward in 2015.Currently, the BBMP is running a telephonic control room to address grievances from the head office. The facility has eight control rooms in all the zones with a separate centralised system at its training centre (IPP centre) in Malleswaram.As of now, the Bengaluru Traffic Police is responding to complaints received through social media.	grievance,BBMP,Social media,	 Jan 31 2019
BBMP is renovating Harishchandra ghat	ghat burial ground in the city’s Rajajinagar area reportedly at a cost of Rs 50 lakh.The civic body is upgrading the two electric furnaces at the ground.BBMP’s electrical executive engineer for burial grounds V Anand said: “The existing furnaces are horizontal and now, we are making them vertical.”Anand said doing maintenance work with the horizontal furnace takes a lot of time since the bricks have to be removed periodically. “The vertical furnace reduces the maintenance time,” Anand said. “The furnaces are now completely dismantled. With the horizontal ones, it takes up to three days to cool and heat up. With the vertical furnace, we can finish the same work within a few hours since we don’t have to replace the coil. Until now, we had to wait for the coil to cool down. Now, (the renovation) saves the time,” he added. The BBMP is also replacing the chimney with an electric one. A minimum of six bodies are cremated in the furnace, which could go up to ten sometimes necessitating the renovation of the chimney, the executive engineer said. The civic body has made arrangements at Chamarajpet and Somanahalli burial grounds to accommodate bodies for cremations until the Harishchandra ghat is ready.The cost of renovating the burial ground is said to be Rs 50 lakh. “We have been given February 18th as the deadline and we are trying to finish the renovation work before that,” said Anand.“Usually it takes an hour to cremate each body, which costs Rs 250,” added Anand.

Kidwai reeling under acute staff shortage	cancer treatment in the state, is facing acute staff crunch. According to its director, the hospital is functioning with just about 30% of manpower.Dr C Ramachandra, the director of the institute, said for 650 beds, there are about 820 staff, including doctors, nurses, technicians etc. There is a shortage of 839 staff members.Most of the Group D workers, about 360 of them, including security guards and cleaning staff, are outsourced.The hospital proposes to build a 450-bed capacity building for which addition of 885 staff needs to be recruited in a year.“We already have people who have agreed to construct the 450- bed hospital. I am waiting for the government to sanction the posts required. The chief minister has been hopeful. But we just want files to move at the earliest,” the director added.He said the institute was creating six new departments for which additional staff was required.Once the additional 450 beds are ready, the Kidwai would have about 1,100 beds, becoming the largest cancer care hospital in the country.The scene a year agoIronically, experienced contract staff from the hospital were removed a year ago. About 200 contract staff members, working for over 10 years, had protested seeking regularisation of their service.According to one of the protesting members, who now works in a private hospital, said most of those who protested could not continue working at the hospital. “The hospital asked us to write exams and go through the procedure for regular appointment, to which we agreed. We had sought 5% of weightage as we were all experienced staff members.“But the hospital and even the high court declined our request. Only three of the 200 contract workers could clear the regular appointment procedure,” added the former staff.Most of these experienced staff missed out on the regular post with some five to 10 marks.DH News Service	Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology,Bengaluru,	 Jan 31 2019
Mini Lalbagh taking shape in East Bengaluru	on Hoskote road and the unsightly land around it will be transformed into a botanical garden christened as East Lal Bagh.Spread across 152 acres, the coconut farm, which is a unit of the State Horticulture Department, is home to about 3,500 coconut trees of different varieties. The department is all set to lay out a botanical garden, giving lung space to the citizens of Bengaluru’s biggest IT corridor. The project was proposed four years ago but the groundwork had not begun for want of funds. The project is estimated to cost around Rs 1.5 crore, according to officials.Similarly, the work on setting up similar mini botanical gardens on the lines of Lalbagh at Chikkaballapur, Tumakuru, Mysuru and Uttara Kannada (Sirsi) are in full swing, according to horticultural officials.As the farm already encloses a thicket of coconut trees, the department is planning to sow suitable saplings in the habitat. The existing coconut palms are utilised for mixed cropping, multi-tier cropping, border cropping and intercropping. “We will plant shade plants that include flowering plants like orchids, spices and condiments, beverage crops, fodder grasses, timber trees, palms and buffalo grass. Coconut palms are the base plantation in various cropping systems. It has the potential to produce more high-value crops,” said N Jagadish, Joint Director (Parks and Plantations), Horticulture.Work like installing irrigation network has been done and a 2 km walking stretch is being constructed now.The garden might also include an amphitheatre and butterfly garden including signage everywhere helping visitors. The safety measures are being taken against coconuts falling.“The coconut trees adjacent to pathways are to be installed with basket made of cast iron. For the remaining trees, regular checking should be done,” said Jagadish.The coconut farm has been maintained by the department for abut 35 years now. The farm is facing a severe water crisis.“We need at least 20 litres of water a day. To cater to future water needs, we will use treated water from industries around. We have completed rejuvenating the existing borewells and drilling of four new borewells have been completed. We have also installed pumpsets and sprinkler irrigation systems,” added Jagadish.This mini Lal Bagh is an expansion of the existing botanical garden in the city which serves as a refreshment to the citizens in East Bengaluru.“We cannot expect the same footfall as in the main Lal Bagh.

Activists recount trees along proposed flyover route	were seen counting the trees on Ballari Road.Vijay Nishanth and Shiva - urban conservationists and activists - on Tuesday counted the trees once again on the stretch from Basava Circle to Hebbal flyover where a steel flyover has been proposed.“Around 140 trees have been marked to be axed for the steel flyover. So we are counting the trees once again. The final report will be placed in the public domain,” said Nishanth, who is also the founder of Project Vruksha.In 2016, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had counted 812 trees along the stretch. The BDA had then said while 56 trees will be translocated, 756 will be axed. This number has now been dropped to 140. But citizens are not convinced and so they are counting them for themselves.“In just one hour from Cauvery theatre to Palace Grounds, we have counted 92 on one side. The trees belong to various species, including Gulmohar, Rain Tree, Mahogany, Indian Coral tree, Copper Pod, Country Fig and Jamoon,” Nishanth added.The duo is noting the tree number, species, girth and age. The exercise will be completed in two days.Interestingly, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has not yet received any information on the number of trees to be axed.The Forest Cell of the BBMP maintained that no application had been made to the Tree Officer and to the Tree Authority.According to the Tree Act and the Karnataka High Court, it is mandatory for the BDA or anyone to seek permission from the Tree Officer before cutting down any tree.But since the number of trees to be axed are more than 50, then as per court orders, a public hearing will have to be conducted by the Tree Authority, a BBMP forest cell official said.	steel flyover,Bengaluru,	 Jan 30 2019
City's traffic woes: DH submits charter of demands	in their approach to city’s traffic woes, which are multiplying by the day. It’s in view of this looming crisis that DH organised an event to find solutions.The discussion, ‘A City Stuck in Jams: Is There a Way Out?’, saw senior officials from the government as well as experts and activists from the transport sector emphasising the need for integrating different modes of transport.Based on the ideas emerging from the event, DH prepared a charter and presented it to Transport Department Principal Secretary B Basavaraju and Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) P Harishekaran.The demands included ideas from IISc professor of Transport Engineering Ashish Verma and activist Vinay Sreenivasa, who stressed the need for supporting public transport instead of funding huge infrastructure projects like elevated corridors and steel bridge.Basavaraju, who received the charter, said work was on to establish the Bengaluru Metropolitan Land Transport Authority (BMLTA) and the long-pending Road Safety Authority. “The charter of demands has some good suggestions. We are already working on implementing some of these and will consider others too,” he said.At present, issues related to city commute are handled by the Transport, Urban Development and Home Department. The BMLTA will act as an overarching body where plans and decisions are made with the concurrence of all departments at once.Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) P Harishekaran said he would distribute the copies of the citizens’ charter among DCPs (Traffic) and discuss how best the points can be implemented. Officials said the formation of a road safety authority was in the last stages. The Assembly has already passed the bill, only rules have to be framed, they said.	Bengaluru,traffic,	 Jan 29 2019

Mahadevapura flyovers: BBMP weeds out invasive plants 	the flyovers in Mahadevapura and KR Puram. Residents, meanwhile, suspect bird droppings could be one of the reasons for excessive plant growth on the concrete structures.The drive is on as there has been an intensive growth of plants of late, especially small shrubs, in expansion joints and weep holes of the flyovers in the area.The citizen activists of Mahadevapura had identified the issue and had complained to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) four years ago.At the time, the Palike officials were confused as to which department should take up the responsibility for invasive plants as the residents complained the civic body was passing the buck.Finally, on BBMP chief engineer G Parameshwariah's instructions the work commenced a few days ago in Mahadevapura and KR Puram.“The work was supposed to be done seven years ago, but it stretched until now. We have checked the plant overgrowth in Marathahalli and Narayanapura flyovers so far. There are about 14 flyovers in Mahadevapura alone. We will complete the work in a couple of weeks,” said Parameshwariah.“We have applied anti-growth agents in affected areas so that the plants do not sprout again. The plants exert pressure on the concrete structures and destabilise them over time. Hence it is always good to remove them,” the chief engineer said.According to him, removing the plants from flyovers requires a lot of effort. “We need long ladders that reach every nook and cranny of the concrete structures. Also, doing the work during day time causes traffic jam. Hence, the work is done meticulously during night,” he added.“This was a long pending issue and many residents have attempted to address this for over four years. Various BBMP departments washed their hands off saying it is not their responsibility. Now that it is done, we need a BBMP department to be accountable and periodic maintenance should be in place,” said Clement Jayakumar, a resident of Doddanekundi.“These plants, especially the peepal or the ficus, can cause structural damage. This is such a necessary exercise and should be done periodically. Many a time in the past, some of us counted 20-odd such saplings on KR Puram cable bridge and Marathahalli rail bridge and informed the authorities,” added another resident.

Parameshwara announces Rs 50,000 cr project for city	the IT capital of India, is on the cards.With an aim to upgrade the amenities on the lines of other international cities, the state government is up for a huge development plan for the city, said G Parameshwara, Deputy Chief Minister and Bangalore Development Minister.Speaking at the inauguration of Shankar Mutt ward development programme on Monday, Parameshwara said: “I have ordered the officials to prepare a roadmap to develop the city in the next five years,” he said.“The pace at which the city is growing is tremendous, and we will spend Rs 50,000 crore for the project,” Parameshwara said.He added that property tax collection was important to increase the revenue targets.“A total of Rs 2,500 crore property tax collection is pending. I have ordered the officials to take strict action against the defaulters. The names of defaulters will be published if they fail to pay the tax,” he added.However, the details of the project are not yet known.The minister also said the steel flyover project would be taken up, despite the general opposition.“There is some opposition for the steel flyover project. This is an elevated road. But it is called steel bridge as a certain amount of steel will be used in the construction process. We will not let go this project just because some people oppose it. We will be transparent during the process. If anyone comes in the way, we may resort to legal action against them.”Reacting to this, Srinivas Alavilli, co-founder of Citizens for Bengaluru said: “It is very unbecoming of the minister. We are asking for public consultation. We want the government to consider the development of Bengaluru in a holistic way. We cannot build things in isolation. Let there be more push for the sub-urban rail and metro network.”Parameshwara also said the state cabinet has approved replacing the sodium vapour lamps with LED lights as this would help the BBMP save Rs 18 crore per month. “Our goal is to transform Bengaluru into a global city,” said Parameshwara.A badminton court, tennis roof and a BBMP office were constructed under the Shankar Mutt ward development programme.Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun, BBMP ruling party leader M Shivaraju and BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad were present on the occasion.

Kidwai hospital to digitise patient records	Memorial Institute of Oncology, as the hospital is all set to go digital with the patients’ records.At the moment, patients have to carry hospital records, reports and scanned images in person for the scheduled appointment with the doctor.If all goes well, in the next six weeks, the complete patients’ records will be available online for the oncologists treating cancer patients at the state’s premier institute of oncology.“We have tied up with Infosys Foundation to digitise patients’ records. We hope it will happen soon. Every patient will get a UID number (unique identity number) and all the records of the patients will be tagged to the UID. Each and every treatment record including scan reports, blood reports etc will be saved under the UID. This way the doctors can have a complete history of the patient at their fingertips,” said Dr C Ramachadra, director of the institute.Explaining how the digital records maintenance will help, the director said most patients misplace the physical records or do not come for a proper follow-up. “It is also very difficult when the history of the patient is not available easily, patients have to carry it around and some even misplace them. Many patients coming from far-off locations do not come for the follow-up on time and this affects the treatment of patients with cancer,” added Dr Ramachandra. More than anything, the hospital will now be able to collect data of cancer patients, analyse it and use it for teaching and for further research. According to the director, there might be initial hiccups going digital with the records, but digitisation is what the hospital will be using henceforth.The hospital treats over 1,000 patients in OPD and has 650 beds that are always occupied and many patients in waiting. About 400 patients undergo radiation and 40 patients take chemotherapy.	Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology,	 Jan 28 2019

Fresh bids for tunnel line of Namma Metro's Phase 2	line of Phase 2, the BMRCL has invited fresh bids for the last two packages of the 13.7-km tunnel between Dairy Circle and Nagavara.The BMRCL had previously thought of reducing the tunnel to about 6 km after four companies quoted 69% more than the estimated cost, escalating the price of Rs 5,000 crore civil work by nearly Rs 3,500 crore.After cancelling the tender, the BMRCL has been inviting tenders for the underground section in packages. The time-consuming process has delayed the Gottigere-Nagavara (Reach 6) line by nearly two years. Bids were invited for two packages in the middle of the tunnel section last year.The tenders invited on Monday cover the tunnel section’s tail ends — Tannery Road to Nagavara (4.59 km) in the north and Dairy Circle to Langford Town (3.65 km) in the south. The civil work for the 8 km stretch is estimated to cost Rs 2,811.75 crore. The bids will be opened in March but the financial evaluation may take some months. Tenders for the midsection — Shivajinagar to Tannery Road (2.88 km) and Vellara Junction to Shivajinagar (2.75 km) — were invited in June 2018. The work is yet to be awarded as the last date for the bidding was postponed several times. The civil work should be completed by 2022.	Phase 2,BMRCL,underground line,	 Jan 24 2019
BBMP to advertise council meet webcast	the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is planning to advertise the live streaming. The BBMP became the first city body in the country to live-stream the council sessions through its official website linked to YouTube but has been struggling to increase viewership. Viewership for the meeting held on December 27, 2018, was a meagre 260. “Webcast of the council meeting hasn’t reached many people,” the BBMP’s council secretary Pallavi K R told DH.“We’ve therefore proposed to give publicity to the event. The civic body’s IT department would take a decision on this.” All 198 corporators attend the BBMP council meeting at the civic body’s headquarters, where they voice the concerns of their respective wards.The civic body also makes policy decisions at the meeting, chaired by the mayor, the deputy mayor and the BBMP commissioner.Four cameras installedThe civic body has installed four cameras at different angles in the council hall at a cost of Rs 80 lakh to live-stream the proceedings.The initiative is based on a survey of Indian cities by the nonprofit Janaagraha. Around the world, the city of London in the United Kingdom and Ontario in Canada do similar live streaming of their municipal meetings on a mobile app.	Council sessions,BBMP,Live-streaming,	 Jan 24 2019
Renovated Sarakki Lake to lure birds in their thousands	"place where birds flocked in thousands. Now, officials involved in its renovation want to restore its past glory. The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) is planning to build an island at the lake’s centre to allow birds to perch and settle amidst the cooler surroundings of the waterbody. Bommanahalli MLA M Sathish Reddy inspected the ongoing renovation at the lake on Wednesday. Speaking to DH, Bommanahalli corporator C R Rajmohan Raju said: ""We are planning to construct a central island and make it attractive for birds. This was once known as ‘Saavira Hakki’ lake and we want to bring (those glorious days) back."" Plans are also on to build a cycling track, a ramp for walkers, a gymnasium for senior citizens and a children's play area around the lake, he added. ""The entire lake was filled with sewage water and silt. BWSSB workers are still trying to fix the sanitary pipes releasing sewage water into the lake. About six feet of muck has been removed from the lake so far,” he further said. Reddy urged the state government to grant an additional Rs 10 crore for the lake’s renovation. ""We've been granted Rs 9 crore for the work. We've written to the officials to grant more sums,” Raju said. He said two spots will be created at designated places to immerse idols during the Ganesha festival."	BDA,Sarakki Lake,Lakes in Bengaluru,	 Jan 23 2019
Buffer zone ruling will hit 35K flats: BBMP	affidavit before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, giving the details about the number of buildings to be affected if the NGT’s order on buffer zone is followed retrospectively.The BBMP claimed that 35,054 flats would be affected as they come under the increased buffer zone limits. Though the BBMP has given the sanction plan and commencement certificates, it has not issued the occupancy certificates. According to the affidavit, over 31,500 buildings come under the buffer zone of stormwater drains or rajakaluves. Approximately, there are 19.40 lakh buildings in the BBMP area.Speaking to DH, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said the hearing is continuing on Wednesday also, and the decision will help them know the status of these buildings, whether they will be retained or demolished.As per the ongoing case in the Supreme Court, whether the NGT can change the buffer zone of lakes and stormwater drains or not, close to 66,554 buildings in the city are in question. During 2016, NGT ruled saying that to protect the environment, the buffer zone of lakes have to be increased from the existing 30 meters to 75 meters from the lakes. It even shut down a few industries in the city, which was falling under the increased buffer zone.	Buffer zone,BBMP,NGT,	 Jan 23 2019
Construction and demolitiondebris piling up in B'luru	the civic agencies and the pollution control board officials are worried about. Construction and demolition waste (C&D) piling up across the city is posing a major challenge.With the C&D waste accumulating by the day and nothing going to the landfills, officials from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) are now encouraging people to use the C&D waste for their own works.According to C&D waste rules of 2016, property owners should dispose of the C&D waste. As that is not happening it is piling up everywhere, Manoj Kumar, KSPCB member secretary said. He added that the rules also define that at least 60% of the C&D waste should be recycled. But this has had little impact as well.Though the KSPCB and the BBMP identified a three-acre space to receive 1,000 tonnes of C&D waste per day in Chikkajalla in 2017, nothing has been dumped there so far. Bengaluru is the second city in India after Delhi to have a designated area for C&D waste.“It is a good resource; people can utilise it. C&D waste consists of bricks, mud, rocks and much more. Some people have been taking small quantities to level their land in low lying areas. More people shall do the same,” Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner, health and solid waste management, BBMP told DH.He said the BBMP is also looking for empanelled agencies - like quarry owners - to collect the C&D waste and utilise it.Haphazard management of C&D waste has also agitated the chief secretary, T M Vijay Bhaskar, who is also reviewing the matter and how it should be handled.KSPCB officials are in fact worried that the rule mandating penalising of those stocking C&D waste on roadsides has not been implemented till date by the BBMP. Due to this heaps of C&D waste continue to remain unattended across vacant sites and roadsides.	BBMP,Construction Debris,	 Jan 22 2019
BMTC hopes to get NGT nod to add 1,200 buses	burden with increased maintenance costs, the BMTC has proposed to acquire 1,200 new buses over the next one year, hoping that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) will not show a red signal in the final hearing next month.In 2019, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has to scrap about 400 buses that have run 8.50 lakh bus kilometres or buses as old as 11 years, BMTC Managing Director N V Prasad said.The exercise will effectively bring down the strength of the fleet from the existing 6,500, which the activists have long held as inadequate considering the rising demand for better public transport.“We plan to induct 1,200 buses and hope to obtain the NGT’s nod for the same during the final hearing scheduled on February 27,” he said.With losses crossing Rs 650 crore by the end of the previous financial year, the corporation is seeking nearly Rs 300 crore government aid to manage its operations. While the previous Siddaramaiah-led govt had cleared a proposal to lease 1,500 buses, officials have sought the government’s help in purchasing the 1,200 buses as per the directions of the Transport Minister, D C Thammanna.Sources in the legal wing of the Transport Department said the NGT had not blocked the acquisition of new diesel buses. “The NGT has not said that we can’t buy diesel buses but has directed us not to buy without bringing it to their notice in view of increasing pollution in the city. However, considering that the BMTC plays a significant role in reducing emissions despite using BS IV vehicles, we are confident that the NGT will see our positive role,” a source said.Exemption soughtThe government recently gave Rs 100 crore grant to the corporation, which helped in clearing the gratuity pay dues. However, the staggering financial loss has only climbed further high, thanks to the increase in the diesel prices.The BMTC has also sought exemption from the Motor Vehicle Tax, which costs the corporation about Rs 120 crore annually.

Two damaged roads stuck in PWD-contractor tussle	unattended for more than a year now as a result of a tussle between the Public Works Department (PWD) and a contractor.The road connecting Sarjapur and Ittangur in south-east Bengaluru is frequented by more than 1000 commuters every day. Now it is filled with nothing but mud and dust.The PWD had started the repair work two years ago, but a rift between the PWD officials and a contractor has left the road unattended, say the residents. According to them, the commuters are facing the brunt.“The contractor of this road has been blacklisted by the PWD but is attending to the Sarjapur-Chandapura road work. He hasn’t started the work; it’s been 8 months,” says Deepanjali, a member of Voice of Sarjapur. However, Yethiraj, assistant executive engineer, PWD, dismisses the allegation that there was a fight between PWD officials and the contractor. “The contractor just slowed down the work but has never stopped the work. There was a small misunderstanding that has been sorted out now. The contractor has started the road work and will complete it in a month,” he said.A road connecting Dommasandra and Attibele via Sarjapur village in southeastern Bengaluru was widened a few months ago, but it has already worn out.“The road is full of potholes. There are no street lights, nor there is space on either side of the road for footpaths. No trees or stormwater drain either. There is no speed limit as it is a national highway and has no traffic signs. High-speed trucks are creating a dangerous situation for pedestrians and small vehicles,” says another member of Voice of Sarjapur.The Karnataka Road Development Corporation (KRDCL) is responsible for the repair and maintenance of the national highway, says Yethiraj. “PWD is yet to hand over the road development project to KRDCL. It is in the process. The PWD can’t invest in the repair work of the road as KRDCL is anyway going to do it. But we have made temporary repairs to ease traffic,” he adds.

'NGT order will see 95% of Bengaluru buildings razed'	respect to buffer zones around the lakes and stormwater drains were implemented, it would result in the demolition of 95% of buildings in Bengaluru, the Karnataka government has told the Supreme Court.Besides, the state would be forced to pay a compensation of Rs three lakh crore to the people. The green tribunal has enlarged the buffer zone specified in 2015 revised master plan, which was statutory in character, and declared it as a no-construction zone, it said.In a written note, Karnataka’s Advocate General Udaya Holla had told a three-judge bench presided over by Justice A K Sikri that the NGT ordered for maintaining a buffer zone of 25 m as a no-development zone, and demolition of all constructions falling in the area.“Tertiary stormwater is in front of every house/building. None of the plots/sites in Bengaluru, barring a few, measure more than 50x80 ft. Therefore, if the impugned order is to be given effect to, nearly 95% of all buildings will have to be demolished,” he said.According to the BBMP’s map of primary and secondary stormwater drains of Bengaluru, their total strength aggregated to 856.74 km. Consequently, the buffer zone required to be kept in BBMP aggregated to 21,400 acres. In addition, the increased buffer zone in respect to lakes aggregated to 11,000 acres within the BBMP area. Thus, the total buffer zone with no development required to be kept totalled to 32,400 acres, which is equivalent to 131 sq km. If the tertiary storm water drain is also taken into account, virtually, the whole of Bengaluru will have to be kept vacant as a buffer zone with no construction.Sections 60 and 69 of the Karnataka Town Planning Act mandated the state to pay the market value to the owners of the land if it was required to be kept as an open area.“Taking into consideration, the conservative market value of Rs 10 crore an acre, the total increased buffer zone would require the state to pay a compensation of over Rs 3,00,000 crore,” the top law officer of the state said.The state government also claimed there are existing 31,500 buildings in the increased buffer zone of lakes and 19.40 lakh in increased buffer zones of stormwater drains.The top court is to resume hearing on Tuesday on a batch of appeals filed by the Karnataka government and others, against the NGT’s May 4, 2016 order for maintaining a buffer zone and a green belt of 75 metres in case of lakes, 50 metres for primary, 35 metres for secondary and 25 metres for tertiary rajakaluves.

Ward-wise tenders for wet waste disposal	"level, the BBMP has called ward-wise tenders to dispose of waste. This will include the collection and segregation of wet waste, sanitary waste and street sweeping waste, and secondary transportation of segregated wet and street sweeping waste in all 198 wards.BBMP special commissioner Randeep D told DH: “There is a standing high court order that the tender on SWM has to be called in a decentralised manner and in packages for each ward. The contractor who will successfully bid for the tender will collect the wet waste. Earlier, both dry and wet waste used to be collected by the same contractor.” The tender cost is pegged at Rs 435 crore. The last date to submit the bids is February 20. ""This move will encourage people to segregate waste at source,"" he added."	Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,Garbage collection,	 Jan 21 2019
BBMP for reusables over single-use disposables	guidelines shortly on the use of disposable materials at events organised in the city. It has been found that paper and plastic materials make up 16% of Bengaluru’s waste. In order to reduce the amount of waste generated at events, the BBMP is now pushing for reusable materials as against single-use disposables.This was enforced as a pilot at the Organics and Millets 2019 International Trade Fair last weekend, which was held at the Palace Grounds on Bellary Road.“We want to issue a general directive to event organisers from both private and government entities to avoid using single-use disposables in programmes. For instance, if organisers use paper plates or disposables that are made of areca palm stalks, it may be allowed as per the law. However, these are single-use and are thrown away thereafter. We have to use steel plates instead in such cases. We are trying to focus on our shift from single-use disposables to re-usable materials,” said Randeep D, additional commissioner (admin), BBMP. “The emphasis is going to be on reusable materials,” he added. Meanwhile, citizens feel that this is a great move by the civic body.“Be it programmes at our homes or large scale events, food is an integral part. Disposables need a lot of space and use various materials for packaging. Using a steel plate instead of a paper plate can make a lot of difference,” Praneeth K Sargur from Sarakki told DH. “This should not remain on paper but should be implemented on the ground. The government banned single-use plastic water bottles, but the city is not rid of them yet,” said Sneha Ram from Banashankari III Stage.

Sarakki signal: Residents protest for better footpaths	Kanakapura Road staged a protest on Saturday against the lack of basic civic amenities like proper pavements and footpaths. They came together under the umbrella of KARAMOC (Kanakapura Road Apartments Movement of Change). The residents formed a human chain, demanding that issues such as lack of footpaths, two-wheeler parking along footpaths and lack of pedestrian crossing in their area be addressed. They want the civic authorities to install bollards along the footpaths as it has been indiscriminately used by two-wheelers, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk. They want the broken footpaths to be repaired as well as encroachments to be cleared. The protesters also highlighted the lack of pedestrian crossing at the Sarakki signal, with just 10 seconds to cross the road. They also demanded that pelican signals be installed.Dumping of garbage on the roads and open spaces was another issue they wanted to highlight. Marshals must be deployed to check this menace and defaulters should be penalised, they said. TV actor Sudha Belawadi, who is a resident of the area, participated in the protest.

Fruits, veggie vending machines at 10 places in B'luru	will soon be installed at 10 public places in the city.All you will have to do is insert a Rs 10 or Rs 20 note and get what you want. The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), which has developed the machines at a cost of Rs 2.5 lakh each, has sent a proposal to the state government to instal them at bus stands, railway stations, the BBMP head office, Lalbagh and main markets. The machines will vend 36 different fruits, vegetables, flowers and seeds round the clock. IIHR representatives will be present to help customers. The first of such machines has already been set up on the IIHR campus in Hesaraghatta, according to the institute’s director, M R Dinesh. The machines are generating interest. The Puducherry agriculture minister visited the institute recently and placed an order for setting them up in the union territory, Dinesh added. The IIHR has also come up with a fruit and vegetable vending mobile van that can store 400 kg of fruits and vegetable and keep them fresh for at least two days. Each van will be fitted with humidifying boxes to keep fruits and vegetables cool and fresh. The rooftop will have a solar panel to power the boxes. Each van costs Rs 12 lakh, including the steel material and the solar panel. Mushroom rasam in mid-day mealsThe IIHR has suggested including mushroom powder-mixed rasam in mid-day meals. “...Mushrooms are rich in protein as well as vitamins B and D that help in children’s growth,” said institute director, M R Dinesh.

BDA's revised master plan 2031 set to get govt approval	across the city, the government has decided to give a green signal to the long-pending revised master plan 2031.It has also decided to drop the proposal to place the plan again before the people for a final opinion and wants to clear at the earliest what the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had presented.The government arrived at the decision as it did not receive any inputs from the specially constituted inspection committee to oversee the master plan.Sources in the government told DH that the government has decided to clear the master plan tabled by the BDA, which has been finalised after incorporating all 14,000 suggestions made by the people.The BDA had received over 14,000 suggestions when the draft was placed before people for opinions and following this, it had revised the draft master plan. This proposal is pending before the government for the past year.To oversee the minute details of the master plan, in 2017, the government had formed a three-member committee, which comprised retired and serving IAS officers. Apart from giving suggestions on improving the plan, the job of the committee was to oversee the progress the BDA had made in addressing issues of people.The committee, however, met only once on January 31, 2018. The sources in the government said since the committee made no headways, it was decided not to delay the master plan.A senior BDA official said: “The government has decided to take the master plan ahead from where it was left, without any delay. The decision was taken at the last meeting held with the chief minister and the deputy chief minister. This is a good move as the pressure on the BDA from lobbyists to make changes is only increasing .”According to the master plan process, the BDA had given 60 days time to people to respond to the master plan, the official explained. The second public hearing was only an addition.	BDA,Master Plan,	 Jan 19 2019
BBMP dumping yard puts Kundalahalli Lake in danger	few years, is threatening Kundalahalli lake with activists stating that mounds of waste may be slipping into the lake.Residents of Kundalahalli in East Bengaluru said garbage and construction debris at the periphery of the lake have reached dangerous heights. While the waste is sliding to the footpath on Kundalahalli main road, they fear that it may be getting mixed with water on the other side.The residents with the help of civic body had rejuvenated the lake a year ago with the help of corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. They had installed a sewage treatment plant that is currently in operation.Besides, there is a 20-acre landfill near the lake where the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) solid waste management contractors segregate the waste. All this has turned a bugbear to the residents in the vicinity of the lake.Lake activists claimed that the construction debris has been dumped at the buffer zone of the lake, in violation of National Green Tribunal guidelines.“The garbage spilt on the footpaths has led to the growth of wild plants and bushes. The area has become dangerous to walk after dark, as it is a desolate stretch. Several incidences of robbery and molestation attempts on women have occurred in December. As the road is neglected by authorities, eateries have come up causing traffic congestion during the day leaving no space for parking vehicles,” said Gilbert Millicent Nathan from Huawei Technologies India Private Ltd, a resident.He added: “Stench from the garbage is spreading to software companies nearby. Thousands of houseflies from the garbage dump yard are spreading across roadside eateries and office canteens, posing a risk to health.”A BBMP official said the garbage was being segregated at the same vacant land for some years now. “We are not given any other land to segregate garbage. We will get the dangerous bushes chopped down,” said a BBMP official.	Kundalahalli lake,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,garbage dumping,	 Jan 19 2019
BBMP to launch e-vaccine programme	roll out Electronic Vaccine Intelligent Network (eVIN) to monitor the status of stored vaccines in hospitals across the city.The eVIN is an app-based technology that helps in gathering real-time data on stored vaccines, its stocks and flows, and even its storage temperatures across all cold chain points in the city.“All these days, we were monitoring the condition of vaccines manually. This technology will ease things out as we can monitor online,” said Dr Manoranjan Hegde, chief health officer, BBMP.“This also reduces the wastage of vaccines. Once there is a change in the temperature in a place, the sensors will send signals through the app, so that necessary action can be taken immediately,” explained Hegde.“The BBMP will launch this project across 87 primary health centres and 30 maternity homes across the city in the next 10 days,” he said. All our staff have been given adequate training, he added.How this works?With the help of the eVIN application, those who monitor the storage have to update the information about the net utilisation of each vaccine in standardised registers at the end of every immunisation day. Temperature data is recorded and updated every 60 minutes on the server via General Packet Radio Service. The difference in temperature is communicated by sending an alarm through a mail or SMS.The programme was launched by the Centre in 2015. It was rolled out across 12 states in 371 districts, including Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The government is extending the programme across Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttarakhand.	Vaccine,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,	 Jan 19 2019
Minor fire at KIA reinforces preparedness	International Airport (KIA) here late Tuesday night was attributed to a short-circuit. Dubbing it a 'minor' fire, a Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) spokesperson informed that it was put out within five to seven minutes.The fire was reported at 10.30 pm. However, it did not cause any disturbance to the airport operations, according to the spokesperson. The incident also did not warrant a probe. But the episode has reinforced the airport's fire safety preparedness since any bigger breakout could be catastrophic. KIA is India's third busiest airport with an estimated 32 million passengers using it every year. Understanding the risk involved in an airport with huge volumes of the highly inflammable stored in aircraft tankers, BIAL had acquired four Rosenbauer 6x6 fire trucks exported from Austria. Three of these are in active service, while one is a backup vehicle. In case of a fire emergency, these fire trucks are programmed to be at any spot within the airport premises in two minutes. The trucks are powered by an 18,000 cc engine with 703 BHP, reaching speeds of 80 kmph in less than 25 seconds. Each truck weighs 40 tons and ferries 12,500 litres of water, 350 litres of fuel and 1,500 litres of foam. To respond to the threat of a chemical/biomedical disaster at KIA, the Union Home Ministry had recently announced that the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) will set up a Regional Response Centre (RRC) in Yelahanka with an estimated 1,000 personnel. A quick action fire response team is expected to complement any such action by NDRF.	Kempegowda International Airport,Fire Accident,	 Jan 16 2019
Road underbridge near Kadugodi to be ready soon	be complete in a month enabling smooth traffic flow, service roads to be built soon will further add to the comfort.The RUB lies on the stretch that connects Kadugodi and Channasandra junction, which is the main link to Hope Farm, Hoskote, Devangonthi and Chikka Tirupati. The initial works took off three years ago and the construction started just last year.The RUB comes as a relief to commuters as they will not get stranded in the traffic jams at Bengaluru-Jolarpet railway track that intersects the stretch.However, the locals and other commuters wanted the service roads badly as they are forced to take a complete detour through the RUB. Once the service roads are built, they can take routes to their respective layouts without passing through the RUB.The civic body has started the land acquisition process for the service roads and has notified over 49 property owners in the area for the same. Only two buildings that belong to railways on either side of the RUB will be demolished while the rest of the properties are vacant lands, according to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials.Unlike other Palike projects that get stuck in the land acquisition issues, the process for the project is going smoothly as 50% of the landowners have already agreed to receive transferable developmental rights (TDRs).“If the rest of the landowners do not accept the TDRs, then we will look for an alternative compensation method. As of now, we have only recommended (TDRs),” said Ramakrishna Reddy, assistant executive engineer, BBMP.The project costing about Rs 16 crore is shared by the civic body and South Western Railways equally.

Smart city project Phase I to kick off soon	off soon, a year after the formation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to implement the project.Works under Phase I of the project worth Rs 100 crore will begin in five to six months.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the nodal agency to implement the project, is planning to renovate historical markets, 20 major roads, parks, lakes and slums under Phase I.A senior BBMP official said: “The Detailed Project Report (DPR) for Phase I is being prepared. For the project, 50% of the funds are being provided by the central government and the remaining 50% by the state government. It will take around five to six months to take up the project, including the tender process.”“The total cost of the project is around 2,100 crore and around Rs 800 crore worth works will be undertaken through the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model,” he added.According to the proposal, KR Market will be integrated with the Metro terminal to make it more user-friendly. Along with KR Market, Russel Market will also get a face-lift with technology-enabled features such as smart bins, loading and unloading pathways, and designated vending kiosks.“Under the project, about 20 roads will be brought under TenderSURE project. Swathanthra Palya slum will also be developed in the first phase of the project,” the official explained.Bengaluru is among the 30 cities chosen to be deemed as Smart Cities last year and Rs 1,200 crore has been allotted to implement this infrastructure-based project in the city.

Parking without chaos, is there a way out?	on a narrow, one way street? If the city’s Brigade Road is a case in point, here’s one suggestion to better the existing angular parking method that triggers congestion every time a car reverses from a slot: change the orientation.But this, too, has its limitations. So does the third option to park the cars parallel to the vehicular flow.Parallel parking is the best, says Additional Director General of Police, M A Saleem, who is also Commissioner for Traffic and Road Safety. However, on a street as short as the Brigade Road stretch, not more than 55 cars can be accommodated when parked one behind the other.For Sharath Bhat, a freelance advertising writer, the way out is option-2, as illustrated. “You essentially back into your parking slot in the first place. When you’re doing this, you’re not interrupting traffic, but backing towards the kerb,” he explains.The big difference, Bhat points out, is the ease with which you can move out of the parking slot. “All you do is slowly join the flow of traffic. You don’t block the flow. In the first option, if a woman driver needs to exit her parking slot, she will need help from some passerby to (navigate) back out of her slot.”But not everyone is convinced that this is better. “In the second option, reversing into the parking slot will be problematic. When the traffic is heavy and the distance between your car and the one following it is too short, how do you stop and reverse without creating congestion?” counters a commuter.Option-1 illustrates the current state of parking on Brigade Road, a method replicated on many streets across the city. Every time a car pulls out of its angular parking slot, it actually backs into the down flow of the incoming traffic. This considerably slows down the traffic, leading to a pile up, triggering extreme congestion during rush hours.Motorists want to zero in on the best option before the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike implements its ‘Smart Parking’ project, aimed at curbing illegal parking. Under this project, parking spaces are to be equipped with sensors installed along the roads.The sensors will send information on slot availability to display boards placed on streets and to a dedicated mobile app.	parking,Bengaluru,	 Jan 03 2019
Steel flyover will choke even if built today: IISc prof	it was ready by now, according to the original deadline of 2018 for the project. Instead, the government should build a metro line that can serve until 2049, an IISc study shows.Interestingly, IISc professor Ashish Verma uses the traffic volume data from the detailed report (DPR) prepared by the government-appointed agency, to show how the traffic volume to capacity (available road space) would go beyond the saturation level for the present traffic as well.The DPR puts the average vehicle growth rate at 4.75% for the steel flyover, which is much below the 10.6% growth in airline passenger traffic at the Kempegowda International Airport seen in the past nine years.However, the analysis shows that the steel flyover’s volume to capacity would be 1.4 instead of the ideal ratio of 0.7. Hence, the six-lane road cannot serve even today’s traffic, let alone the next five years when the vehicle numbers are likely to cross 1 crore.In stark contrast, a metro line with a narrow viaduct to hold a track on each direction would be able to carry 69,000 people per hour. Even if all of the passengers on the stretch switchover to the metro, the capacity will not go beyond 0.99 till 2057.Besides felling over 800 trees, the vehicles on flyover will only add to air pollution in the city. “For a city which hosted the C40 conference last year, Bengaluru should be aware of the impact of its projects,” Verma noted.He said building a flyover has become a populist measure in the sense that it caters to the people’s aspiration to own a vehicle.“However, at what cost? When the entire world and even India is trying to reduce our dependence on oil, is it not wise to look at sustainable solutions like metro instead of harping on projects that will make the city unlivable for future generations,” he said.The study also warned that the steel flyover would feed into the ‘vicious circle of congestion’, as the new road will lead to more cars with the traffic jams forcing governments to come up with more and more number of flyovers.“It is well known now that 40% to 50% of the carbon emission in the global cities comes from vehicles. Instead of investing in flyovers, the government should adopt sustainable modes like public transport, walking, bicycling,” Verma noted, adding that people will not take to them unless they are attractive.

Metro services from MG Road to Indiranagar resume	as services resumed on Indiranagar-MG Road stretch, restoring the seamless connectivity between stations on the Purple Line.The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) said the services were restored around 9.30 am, right in the middle of the peak hour during which metro records nearly half of its daily ridership on the line.Train operations between Indiranagar and MG Road stations were suspended on Friday to facilitate repair work on a crossbeam supporting a viaduct on Pillar 155 near the Trinity Metro station.The operations on the stretch were scheduled to resume on Monday. However, on Sunday, the corporation promised to run trains by Tuesday afternoon.The public relations office of the corporation said services were restored at 9.35 am, allowing the trains on the 4 km stretch after a gap of three days.“I was travelling from Magadi Road, and there was an announcement that the train would run till Baiyappanahalli. It was a relief considering the problems we had in switching between bus and metro on Friday and Saturday,” said Sumathi K, a commuter.Ajay Seth, managing director, BMRCL, said an agency would be appointed in January to assess the safety of Phase 1 infrastructure. The external audit would likely to be completed in three or four months, and the report would throw light on similar problems in other metro pillars on the 33.48 km elevated stretch of Phase 1.A rare ‘bonhomie’ between metro and BMTCThe three days of disruption in the metro services between Indiranagar and MG Road stations showed how both transport authorities can work in tandem for the convenience of commuters.The BMRCL had hired 80 to 110 buses from Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) for transportation of commuters. The commuters at Baiyappanahalli, who wanted to reach stations beyond Indiranagar station, boarded BMTC buses that carried them free of cost till the Cubbon Park station.Similarly, the metro commuters who wanted to travel beyond MG Road station could get down at the Cubbon Park station and board buses to Baiyappanahalli.A BMTC officer managing traffic at the Cubbon Park metro station called it a rare bonhomie between the two corporations. However, the BMRCL will have to pay lakhs of rupees for hiring the buses.Last year, the BMTC stopped operating most of its metro feeder bus services, two months after introducing the buses to provide first and last mile connectivity.The corporation had written to the BMRCL twice seeking financial support to run feeder buses, where low ridership led to losses.

Digital library still a dream for Whitefield residents	digital library at Thubarahalli is still incomplete.

Experts to monitor metro pillar for 30 days	155 near Trinity Metro Station for 30 days from January 1 to ensure that the structure will remain safe as per the global standards.Prof Chandra Kishen J M from Indian Institute of Science, who inspected the repair work on Sunday evening, declared that the structure remains safe. But they will keep a tab on it for a month to ensure that its integrity remains uncompromised.“We have been involved in the repair work to avert the possibility of a crack in any part of the structure due to the strain put on it during the lifting of the viaduct. This includes the crossbeam, which had developed honeycomb (gaps in concrete). High-pressure grouting (filling of concrete) has been done to reinforce the strength of the damaged part,” he said.He said 27 censors, called Electrical Resistance Strain Gauges, have been installed on the affected structure. “The viaduct has been lifted for grouting work. It takes 24 hours, for the epoxy material (concrete) to harden, the viaduct will be lowered. Each gauge has been installed on a critical part of the structure and will help us track the strength of the structure,” he said.Trial runLed by Kishen, a team of research scholars is working in tandem with officials from the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) to ensure that the pillar returns to the ‘design condition’.“Once the viaduct is lowered. The experts will examine the strength of the repair work once again. After their approval, the rails on the viaduct have to undergo refitment. After the track is ready, we will conduct a trial run on Monday evening,” a BMRCL official said.Asked about the reason for the defect, the IISc professor said honeycombing in concrete structures was a common feature.“It’s a two-metre deep crossbeam, where the concrete has not been compacted properly. It’s a kind of construction defect that should have been rectified in the construction stage itself,” he said.Meanwhile, BMRCL Managing Director Ajay Seth has asked the IISc experts, who are monitoring the design work on Phase 2, to come up with measures to further improve quality control mechanism in Namma Metro.

White-topping delay leaves Kadugodi commuters in a fix	work on the Kadugodi road has become a bugbear to the commuters. Traffic snarls have worsened in the absence of good alternate routes.Regular commuters of the road said the work stopped some weeks ago.The work on the stretch between Hope Farm and Belathur via Kadugodi road started about 10 months ago, but is yet to wrap up.Meanwhile, the BBMP officials said as per the actual deadline, the project should have been completed by November, but, has been delayed due to the contractor’s slow pace of execution. While the work on one lane of the road is complete, the other lane lies in shambles, remains unattended and unusable.“The Underground Drainage Pipelines (UGD) have been lying on the roadside for two weeks now. Movement of vehicles from one lane where white-topping is complete to the other where it is yet to be done, is not smooth. Two wheelers may skid and fall. I have witnessed such instances myself,” said Kusuma Latha, a resident of Kadugodi.The residents also complain about the false promises made by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). “We have been promised street lights, cycle lanes and footpaths as part of this project. But, none of it is initiated,” added Latha.S Muniswamy, the Kadugodi corporator, said the white-topping work from Belathur to Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning has been completed.“The work beyond that stretch needs to be done soon. It has not been stopped, but delayed by the contractor. The UGD pipes have been on the roadside for some days now; they are not disturbing the commuters in anyway. We are pushing the contractor to finish the work soon,” he said.The corporator, however, said the work might take some more months to finish.	Kadugodi Road,white-topping,	 Dec 30 2018
Now, state govt mulls suburban rail Phase 2	foundation stone for the suburban rail project would be laid in a month, officials on Friday mulled over proposing Phase 2 of the project with an extension of the four corridors to towns further away from Bengaluru.Sources said Chief Secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar held a meeting of senior officials where it was decided to push for the extension of the network.“The proposal will not affect the ongoing process but will add to it. The plan is to extend four lines from the present terminal points at Heelalige to Hosur, Kengeri to Ramnagaram, Rajanukuknte to Doddaballapur and Whitefield to Bangarpet, which will add about 130 km to the network,” the source said.The draft feasibility report prepared by the Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) proposes a 160.5 km suburban rail network at a cost of Rs 17,147.20 crore (excluding taxes) and suggests a 5 km line to the airport from Chikkajala. There are four corridors connecting areas in five different directions outside Bengaluru.“The idea of including the underground line to airport, which may cost more than Rs 1,500 crore, was also discussed.The RITES report only makes a suggestion on the line and including it in the corridor has been left to the two parties,” the source said.While the suburban rail corridor connects Nelamangala, officials discussed the possibility of extending the line from Soldevanahalli (part of Nelamangala line) to Tumkur.“The state government will include the Phase 2 proposal in its comment on the draft feasibility report. However, a meeting will be held with officials from the South Western Railway on January 2 where a decision will be taken on the details of Phase 2 network,” a senior official said.Including the Tumakuru and Airport line, the Phase 2 network may cross 170 km in length and together with the 160 km corridor in Phase 1, officials felt that it would be able to better serve the needs of commuters.Waiting for GoK move: RlysThe South Western Railway sent out a release on Friday stating that it was still waiting for the state government’s reply to some of its proposals regarding the suburban rail project.Giving details of Thursday’s meeting between Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, the release said the state government promised to give all necessary clearances at the earliest.“The railway minister stated that the state government should work expeditiously in giving clearance and agree for grant of higher FSI (floor space index), TDR (transferable development rights) etc. to fund railway’s share of the project (sic),” the release said.	suburban rail,Bengaluru,	 Dec 28 2018
BBMP plans compost learning centres in all zones	"up compost learning centres across all zones.This follows after many enthusiasts come forward to learn different kinds of composting methods at the Swachagraha Kalika Kendra, a centre for training composting practices in HSR Layout.The centre situated at the HSR Layout was inaugurated two weeks ago and has earned the tag of becoming the first such centre established by the residents with the Palike's help.Speaking to DH, Randeep D, additional commissioner, (admin), BBMP said: “We want to encourage segregation practice among the residents. So we are going strictly on the tender process and plan to take up these measures.""""Setting up compost learning centres will not only help in creating more awareness they also will educate about the various practices involved here,” the officer added.The Swachagraha Kalika Kendra teaches close to 20 different methods through which composting can be practised at home, including vermicomposting, aerobic anaerobic methods.The civic body is also planning to introduce the incentive methods for those who compost at least 50% of the garbage produced at their premises.“This thought has been there but has not been finalised yet. If the bulk generators reduce their garbage production using composting practices or through some other method, we can plan to offer incentives, maybe in tax collection,” he said.For those who are active on social media, Randeep said the platform has been encouraging to remove the garbage blackspots in the city.“I have been personally receiving messages and videos from the public through Twitter and other social media platforms. This has helped to make the city cleaner. People can send in their videos or photos directly so that I can direct my officials to undertake immediate action,” said Randeep."

BMRCL cancels Outer Ring Road project tender	KR Puram-Silk Board line on the Outer Ring Road, potentially delaying the line further.According to a report by the Times of India, the move came after debt-ridden firm IL&FS came out to be the lowest bidder for the Silk Board-Bellandur, Bellandur-Doddanekundi and Doddanekundi-KR Puram packages.The IL&FS is currently responsible for the construction of the Mysuru Road-Pattanagere stretch of the Kengeri line.The report, quoting a senior BMRCL official, said that the ongoing work on the RV Road-Bommanasandra and Gottigere-Dairy Circle lines has already affected traffic heavily and adding the 17-kilometre ORR line would only worsen the situation. The official also said that the contractor may not be able to begin work as the traffic police is unlikely to give permission for it.The BMRCL is said to have cancelled the tender because other bidders quoted a higher price than the IL&FS.The IL&FS was put under the scanner of the SFIO in October this year and the Centre is looking to sell assets of the debt-ridden firm to provide relief to NBFCs.

Confusion prevails for new NPKL allottees	Kempegowda Layout (NPKL) due to a communication gap between Deputy Chief Minister, G Parameshwara and the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) board.Even as Parameshwara had assured the allottees that they will be given an additional penalty-free extension during randomisation, the message has not reached the BDA officials yet, due to which the allottees are suffering.Surya Kiran an NPKL allottee said: “We allottees have made many visits with requests to the BDA to wave off the late payment fee and over extension on site payment. But nothing has happened. Time for most of the allottees to make full payment is ending as people have started receiving allotment letters. It is crucial for the BDA to look into it.”Sujatha, another allottee, added that bank loans were already a challenge. Late payment fee will only be an additional burden. She said, “The government cannot penalise us for not being financially sound.”BDA officials, meanwhile, expressed helplessness. They say, that so far, no written communication or government order has come. “The government has not issued any orders and the BDA rules cannot be changed without government and board permission. Parameshwara is the BDA board chairman, and also the Bengaluru development minister,” said a BDA official, who did not want to be named.The allottees had also requested the government to reduce the sale-cum-lease period from 10 years to five years.

Act on potholes or lose mandate, HC tells BBMP	BBMP will be declared a failure, and its responsibility will be handed over to another agency if it fails to act on making the city pothole-free. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, while hearing a petition on potholes, asked the BBMP to clear all the zones of potholes starting with Mahadevapura. The area is the worst pothole-affected zone, according to the BBMP. The court further stated that it wants Mahadevapura to be free of potholes by December 17, failing which it will pass orders. The court said that six months had passed, but the BBMP still has not made any substantial improvement. “If the BBMP really wanted, it could have transformed Bengaluru,” the court said. The court further added that if the civic body does not make any improvement to the city by Christmas, then it will have to face the consequences. The court also observed that the BBMP has created a nightmare for Bengalureans. The BBMP has created a problem for itself, and the city, the court said. According to the court, BBMP engineers feel that they are not answerable and are wasting the court’s time; this will come at a heavy cost for the BBMP.On being asked whether the pothole sites are being inspected and the measurement books are evaluated and signed, the Mahadevpura zone chief engineer told the court that he has seen the measurement books, but, has not evaluated or signed them. He would only certify the pothole-filling work on the basis of the assurances given by the BBMP engineers at the respective sites.The court expressed surprise when the chief engineer said that they have not been able to attend to the potholes as they are busy repairing leakages on a daily basis.The court then asked the Mahadevpura zone chief engineer to visit the pothole-filling sites, inspect them, evaluate the measurement books alongside the work done, and certify them. Thereafter, he should produce the certified measurement books before the court for the next scheduled hearing.The court adjourned the hearing of the case until December 17.

BBMP fails to asphalt dug up road in Doddakallasandra	access road dug up and left without blacktop, owing to shoddy civic work by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). The area, among the ones newly added to the BBMP administration, had bare minimum of facilities until the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) dug up the road in October 2017 to lay their water pipeline.Only a month before the civic work, the BBMP had asphalted the road in September 2017. After that, the Palike quite inexplicably took up the Under Ground Drainage pipe laying work, which it is not mandated to do.Praveen, one of the residents, is still clueless as to why BBMP took up the work. “First, (laying UGD) is not BBMP’s responsibility. Still, they carried out the work when it was raining heavily this September (2018) and didn’t bother to asphalt the road. Even levelling of the road was done much later,” he said. He said residents in the area, especially the senior citizens and children, found it harder to breathe due to the dust kicked up by the vehicles on the road.“When I tried contacting the local corporator, she said nothing could be done for the next two-and-a-half years since the road was asphalted in 2017. This’s the typical lack of coordination we see among the civic agencies,” Praveen said.Ward corporator Shobha Gowda assured DH that she would get the road blacktopped at the earliest. “We got the UGD done here through MP. We’ll asphalt the road shortly,” she said.The corporator, however, was not aware that the UGD lines to discharge waste water were actually diverted to another storm water drain. She refused to comment on the issue.. He said the civic body is waiting for the BWSSB to begin the UGD work and asphalt the road after it is over.But a BWSSB engineer said it would be a further two or three months before his agency could take up the UGD work in the area.	road work,BBMP,BWSSB,	 Dec 12 2018
Bids invited for improving footpaths near metros	Rs 81.2-crore makeover. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) invited tenders to this effect on Tuesday. BBMP Commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad said in a tweet: “As part of BBMP’s efforts to improve last mile connectivity, we have floated tenders for development of footpaths and providing non-motorised transit in a number of places connecting metro stations. We intend to complete these works within 6 months after finalisation of tenders (sic).” The project, floated last year, aims to ensure people do not have to walk on traffic-filled roads while reaching metro stations.

Old Airport road footpaths need attention	the HAL Old Airport road was brought to light by DH, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has begun the preliminary work to remove the cables that were blocking the pedestrians’ space.The cable wires jutting out on the sidewalks were cleared, but the rest of the work hangs in the air. The footpaths still have gaping holes in places where slabs are missing. Vendors too, have encroached upon sidewalks in some areas.Several rolls of cables that blocked the footpaths near Manipal Hospital have now been removed. “I can still see some cables in some stretches of the footpath. The BBMP has not completed the work,” said Nirmala Subramanian, one of the senior citizens residing near Manipal hospital.Some residents expressed their despair over the condition of the sidewalks in the area, as they have been unattended for many years now. “I do not know how many days the BBMP needs to carry out the repair work. Nobody cares about the problems faced by the pedestrians,” said Akshay, a resident. Shivanna, a regular visitor to the Manipal Hospital, said he was glad that the work has begun to restore the footpath. BBMP officials, however, cited lack of funds and said the work on footpaths may not take off. “We had removed the encroachments some months ago in the entire Mahadevapura zone. But, some might have reappeared now. We will take action against repeat offenders. We need funds for the repair work,” a BBMP official told DH.	footpath damage,Bengaluru,	 Dec 11 2018
Tracking mandatory for buses, trucks from Jan 1	a vehicle location tracking system in buses and trucks. The move is aimed at making transport services safer for women and children, besides cracking down on tax evaders and misuse of permits.Rolling out the new system, the transport department has stated that the new feature will be a must in all such vehicles which will be registered from January 1.Confirming that the new feature will be rolled out from the beginning of the new year, Transport Commissioner V P Ikkeri told DH that the new system will serve many purposes.“The new system will serve various purposes, including the safety of passengers, monitoring vehicles whether it is operating within the permitted area, women safety and tracking of delivery of goods as mentioned on the Bill,” he explained.Further, Ikkeri clarified, “To begin with, the vehicle location tracking system will be installed in buses and trucks. Subsequently, the government will decide whether to implement the same in all vehicles.”According to the transport department, the owners of the vehicles themselves have to install the GPS-enabled tracking system. The details of the vehicle will be registered at a data centre controlled by a government-appointed agency.“Wherever the vehicle goes, the route will be registered at the data centre. Only the transport and police personnel, if needed, can access the details of the vehicles,” a senior official explained.All these years, the individual transport companies and privately owned transport companies had installed GPS enabled tracking devices and they were tracked by their own facilities. But with the latest system, the government will directly track the movement of vehicles. The move will also help in identifying tax evading vehicles.Number platesClose on the heels of mandating the tracking system in vehicles, the Centre has ordered the use of high-security number plates in all vehicles that will be registered from April 1, 2019.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has issued a circular to all the states. As per the latest order, vehicles manufacturers are required to install the high-security number plates and the vehicle cost will be inclusive of the number plate. “As stated by the Centre, we will only register vehicles that come with these number plates. The state has no role in this,” Ikkeri added.	Transport in Karnataka,	 Dec 11 2018
Jam alert: Over 40 roads set to be white-topped	94.5 km roads in the city, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has begun floating tenders for converting 41 more roads of 63.24 km in length into concrete stretches.With this, commuters who are already hit by ongoing work under Phase 1, have to brace themselves for more traffic jams across the city.The civic body has, in fact, floated tender for next phase before completing Phase 1.Read also: BBMP’s concrete roads a criminal waste of moneyThe work under the second phase has been divided into eight packages. According to the document accessed by DH, most of the stretches chosen are in the congested central business district (CBD) areas. The work is expected to unleash more chaos on roads.The important stretches that will be converted into concrete roads are Gandhi Bazar road, BTS Road in Wilson Garden, New BEL Road to Sanjay Nagar Main Road, Southend Road from Madhavan Park to Nettakallappa Circle, Seshadripuram Main Road, Yeshwanthpur junction to 18th Cross junction at Malleshwaram, 100 feet and 80 feet roads in Indiranagar, among others.“The second phase is divided into eight packages where 41 roads of 63.24 km will be white-topped under grants by the state government,” said a BBMP official.Read also: Flawed design an invitation to floodingOn Sunday, DH had exposed how white-topping is ruining perfectly good asphalted roads.“Since there is a delay in the work of Phase 1, we have decided not to give more than 15 roads to one contractor under the next phase. This will ensure one contractor doesn’t bag all the packages,” the official said.Speaking to DH, N Manjunath Prasad, BBMP Commissioner said, “Phase 2 of white-topping is finalised. Six packages have been already approved and the tender will be floated. Another two packages are yet to be approved. The BBMP plan is to take up white-topping in 1,400 km of city roads in the coming days.”Read also: Poor planning, worse execution: IISc expert“We are trying to minimise people’s problems; the white-topping of roads will last for 25-30 years. We have to take up this project for better, pothole-free roads,” he said.	BBMP,White topping,	 Dec 10 2018
Poor planning, worse execution: IISc expert	‘white-topping’ project is ill-conceived. Dr Ashish Verma, associate professor, transportation and systems engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru questions the very rationale for selection of roads for the Rs 986.64-crore project.“What were the problems on these roads that made the government take up this project?” he said.Slabs on the roadTechnically, it is crucial to understand why the existing bituminous roads had to make way for concrete roads.The way the project is being executed is a cause of concern. Simply putting a concrete slab over the existing road, without removing the existing road, is what is happening now. This method will substantially raise the height of the road.Also read: BBMP’s concrete roads a criminal waste of moneyThe height will rise by the thickness of the concrete slab and that changes the geometrics and cross-sectional design of the road itself. It also disturbs the drains on the side, leaving their level way below the road surface.No utility ductsAnother problem that must be looked into is the underground utilities crossing the road, especially if you are putting a concrete slab on the road.If the utility providers have to carry out maintenance, they will start digging and breaking the concrete. I don’t think provision has been made for underground utility ducts. These are glaring implementation and construction-level defects.None of the existing roads ever had a maintenance problem in the first place. It is not that bituminous roads cannot be maintained. It is because of our own practical loopholes that were weren’t able to do it.Safety at stakeIf you take a close look at the concrete stretch between Mekhri Circle and Sadashivanagar police station, where only half the road is built, you will clearly see the difference in levels. They have put a bituminous black top on the concrete road. This has lent a negative slant that is extremely dangerous for two-wheeler riders. Even light rains render the roads slippery. This means the safety of motorists is ignored. There is no warning signage on these stretches and traffic management is at its worst. There is no provision for pedestrians or cyclists either.

Flawed design an invitation to flooding	have their merits, the BBMP and the contractor are not going about the project professionally.“They are just laying the concrete roads directly above the existing roads, without any inspections on the existing sub-base. I have not seen this happen anywhere else,” he told DH, after accompanying reporters on a tour to some sites. Rajai, who specialised in energy-efficient architecture at Oxford Brookes University, UK, has worked on several big projects in Bengaluru, such as German Consulate in Bengaluru and HLC International in Chennai. US has given up on them I know concrete roads are popular in the US but only on highways, or expressways, as they call them. They don’t do it in urban centres anymore. Such roads were built in the ‘70s and ‘80s but they stopped because of safety concerns. When you have straight roads, it is all right, but when you have bends and turns, it gets extremely slippery when it rains. The concrete surface smoothens with usage. It gets smoother and smoother and this is extremely dangerous for motorists.Digging is expensiveThe maintenance is extremely expensive if you have to dig the concrete and resurface it to repair the utilities.Risk of concrete crackingThe base should be of a certain build up. It should be well-compacted and have layers of grading below. If that’s not done then it will start cracking.If the existing asphalt roads sink, the concrete roads will not sink but crack. I believe the wear and tear for vehicles is higher on concrete roads. Another problem is the glare. The concrete roads abroad are coloured but here the concrete is white, which means the glare is too harsh. This makes riding difficult.Levels are mismatched The concrete road is higher than the footpath. Had they dug up the existing road before laying the concrete road, the difference would not be there. The concrete is now at least six inches above the road. The existing properties especially houses planned with the old asphalt roads in mind, will have to raise their level as well, or live with rainwater flooding in.Drains sure to clog upAnother problem is that the depth of the drain along the footpath reduces by half or more, especially at the entrances to private properties, so the water is blocked and will spill into the houses.

White-topping of roads leaves residents in distress	"Koramangala 4th block has left the residents of the flood-prone area worried.The main concern is the height of the road, which will be more than the footpath.A resident, who did not wish to be named, said, “The BBMP is raising the height of the road by 4 inches...water does not seep through concrete roads and might eventually lead to flooding.”The resident also said that the road will be at a higher level than the footpath. “This might prevent the water from flowing through the tertiary drain, through which rainwater usually flows,” the resident added. Another resident said this could lead to two problems: water will stagnate on the footpath, causing trouble for pedestrians, and also blockage the shoulder drain.The resident also said that the BBMP has undertaken the work without removing the asphalt that was used to tar the road. ""This is a serious concern and how will the road last, if this is the case?"" he asked.Koramangala 4th block is one of the most flood-prone areas in the city. The area suffers from reverse flow of water from the stormwater drain and even from the water accumulated on roads with nowhere to flow. The residents have faced this issue even during the shortest spell of rain.Corporator Chandrappa Reddy, however, said that white topping will not lead to flooding or waterlogging in the locality."

BBMP’s concrete roads a criminal waste of money	parlance---has turned into a never-ending nightmare for citizens.The 11-month deadline to complete two packages, at a cost of Rs 986.64-crore, lapsed in July, and only about 15 per cent of the work is done.No end is in sight either, with the BBMP blaming the police for the delay, and the police saying the BBMP is blind to the city’s traffic problems. Deputy Chief Minister Dr G Parameshwara, meanwhile, says the government is negotiating rates with the contractor, and more roads will get the concrete treatment.Vijayalakshmi, 90, is just one of the many victims of the government’s callousness towards citizen interests. The concrete road in front of her house is almost a foot higher than the existing road and makes it impossible for her even to step out for a stroll.Last year, the BBMP decided to lay concrete roads on 29 stretches. The justification was that existing roads developed potholes easily, and concrete would fix the problem. Experts say the merits are exaggerated; and concrete roads---at Rs 10.44 crore a km in the present contract---are at least five times as expensive as asphalt roads.Last year, with K J George of the Congress holding the Bengaluru development portfolio, the BBMP called for tenders and assigned the job to Madhucon Projects, a Hyderabad company.The project is complicated as road projects go, with sites staggered across the city, but Kamma Srinivasa Rao of Madhucon asked no questions during the pre-bid meeting. He got the contract for two of three packages, the third going to NCC, also from Hyderabad.Read also: Poor planning, worse execution: IISc expertWork began, as specified in the contract, in August 2017. The project was to be completed by July this year. But what you see today, a good four months after the deadline lapsed, is ugly, dug-up stretches everywhere. The project is far from complete, and no one has a clue when it will be done either.“Only eight roads are done,” admits KT Nagaraj, chief engineer, projects (central), BBMP. “The project was delayed because we could not find alternative roads to divert traffic, and also because of the election code of conduct.”Both are dubious reasons: everyone knew Assembly elections were coming up, and the problem of alternative roads did not crop up suddenly out of nowhere. In other words, the BBMP went ahead with the project with the full knowledge that it would be delayed way beyond July 2018.Public projects such as this one are usually given out with a penalty clause: the contractor pays if work is not done in time. But this contractor will get away, because, as Nagaraj says, “the deadline was missed due to departmental reasons.”Citizens, meanwhile, are outraged at what has become of perfectly good roads.The traffic jams have worsened, walking on the footpaths has become impossible, and motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, risk life and limb when they go anywhere near these sites. People living along the ‘white-top’ roads face daily inconvenience in a number of ways.The BBMP claims it is saving citizens money by going in for concrete roads. “White-topping roads last 20 to 30 years and do not require any major maintenance. India spends nearly 70 per cent of its road sector budget only on maintenance of bituminous roads, which is a waste of taxpayers’ money,” says Nagaraj.He says the project was taken up on the basis of a study by the Central Road Research Institute, Delhi. “We also studied similar projects in Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai,” he says.Not everyone is convinced. The design is clearly flawed, says Saveri Rajai, well-known architect.“The roads are a thick slab, about 20 cm higher than existing roads and footpaths, and block the shoulder drains. This is an invitation to water-logging and sewage blocks,” Saveri says.A team of DH reporters visited Basavangudi and found ample evidence of the problems Saveri warns about.‘White-topping’ isn’t helping a city grappling with monstrous traffic. Mysuru Road, already a busy and often choked stretch, is now beset with longer delays.At the Satellite Bus Stand, the hub for all KSRTC buses plying towards Mysuru, people now spend longer hours idling in acrid smoke.Ninety-year-old Vijayalakshmi has been a resident of Basavanagudi for as long as she can remember.Also read: Flawed design an invitation to floodingShe is now confined to her house because the concrete road that the contractor has built in front of her house is too high for her.The otherwise normal road, along Krishna Rao Park, took on an abnormal height after white-topping began. Like at other places, no one has a clue when the work will be completed.Dr Vikram Kashyap, retired neurosurgeon and her son, explains the ordeal: “If I have to take her out, I put a few stones near the road to make a sort of rough incline and then take out the car. There are so many roads with potholes in Bengaluru but Madhav Rao Circle was one of the good stretches.”Problems have multiplied: citizens can’t take their vehicles out because of the mess the BBMP has created in one of Bengaluru’s best-planned, pre-Independence neighbourhoods.Residents, motorists, traders and hawkers---practically everyone who uses the stretch that connects Basavanagudi to the rest of the city---tell you the concrete roads project has destroyed stretches that were in top condition.“Now it is a financial and civic nightmare,” Dr Kashyap says. “The monumental incompetence of the people behind this exercise is to be seen to be believed.”Another development that infuriates people is that the height of the concrete road causes flooding.“Every time it rains, all the rubbish from the road flows into our house. During dry weather, the wind blows rubbish into these places which have turned into veritable ditches,” Dr Kashyap says.With construction debris everywhere, walking on the road is not safe anymore. Dr Kashyap is afraid the hazards could kill.“Could these people not have thought of these things? I feel there are more tragedies waiting to happen,” he observes.Shops and establishments in the area say their business has come down by half. Kaushik Gopal and Chikke Gowda, employees SRS petrol bunk, vouch for it.“Earlier, we used to have many customers come in on their way to work. Now, this road has been rendered one-way and so they skip coming here altogether,” says Kaushik Gopal, manager of the large fuel station.Water from the concrete road flows in even there. “Traffic jams were unheard of on this road and now they are a permanent feature,” says Chikke Gowda. Dr Kashyap is livid at how citizens’ interests are sacrificed by vested interests. “This is not just an abdication of responsibility but conspiracy and collusion between politicians, bureaucrats and almost every single institution. I have seen an elderly citizen who was trying to park on the side of the road. His car got stuck in the gap between the road and the footpath and he had a very tough time getting it out,” he says.Giving staggered permission: Traffic police chief The traffic police had rejected permission for the BBMP to lay concrete roads, but after Additional Commissioner of Police (traffic) P Harishekaran took charge, he has given the green signal for work on five roads.“I have given permission for work on 300 metres every day,” he told DH. The BBMP never finishes work within the stipulated time, and ends up compounding traffic woes, police complain.In August 2018, the Karnataka chief secretary intervened and got the BBMP and the police to the negotiating table. The main reason for the police to reject permission is the lack of alternative roads. A police officer said, “The BBMP must show alternative routes, but they fail to show any.”The BBMP says important stretches have no alternative roads, but the question remains: ‘Why didn’t it think of this problem before giving out the contracts?’KT Nagaraj, chief engineer, projects (central), BBMP, says, “Diverting traffic in a city like Bengaluru is not possible. There are no alternative roads, for instance, to Mysuru Road.”The traffic police had also written to the BBMP to even out the edges of concrete roads; they are a safety hazard, especially for two-wheeler riders.“We are filling the edges and placing concrete blocks to prevent accidents,” Nagaraj says, but the DH team did not find evidence of any of it at many locations.Snail’s paceThe BBMP has given contracts to Madhucon Projects, a Hyderabad company, to lay concrete roads on 94.5 km in Bengaluru. The deadline lapsed four months ago, but only about 15 per cent of the work is done.	BBMP,InSight,	 Dec 09 2018
Land acquisition delays work on Iblur- Carmelaram 	from Iblur to Carmelaram in East Bengaluru is still in its preliminary stage.The land acquisition process has been the biggest challenge for the government.The six-lane 150 feet wide road with two two-lane slip roads on both the sides along with 3-metre wide footpaths was included in BBMP’s action plan last year.The 8-km road is the main access way to many top IT companies and commercial malls in Mahadevapura. The bad condition of the road was also recently brought to the notice of Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy by Wipro Chairman Azim Premji at a meeting in Vidhana Soudha, after which the chief minister had asked the BBMP to complete the work by November.As many landowners are not ready to accept the TDR (Transfer of Development Rights) as an alternative to cash, as the project is being executed at a snail’s pace.“A few landowners have relinquished their properties for road widening. But a few corporate companies and builders are demanding cash as compensation. This settlement is taking time. Hence, we cannot assure the exact date of completion of the project,” said Somashekar, chief engineer (road infrastructure).Though some considerable amount of work is visible on the ground, the commuters expressed their dissatisfaction about the slow pace.“The road widening work was announced so many times by the governments before. We are happy that it has started. But they are still just digging the shoulder drain for the last one year. Mahadevapura ward pays the highest taxes to the government but in return, we get very little compared to smaller wards like HSR or Koramangala,” said Rohin Govindarajan, a resident of Sarjapur Road.“The drainage work is going on at those points wherever the land has been granted to us. We can begin the work at other places once we get the land. We regret the inconvenience caused to the commuters as they are stuck in traffic jams due to the ongoing work,” Somashekar added.The work will be completed in two years, said BBMP officials.

Farmers, residents rue land acquired for projects	acquired for various development projects in and around Kempegowda International Airport, have not received monetary compensation even after many years in Devanahalli constituency.This is one of the major problems the people in and around Devanahalli face and was voiced out by many at ‘Janaspandana: Citizens for Change’, a Deccan Herald and Prajavani event, held at Dr BR Ambedkar Bhavan in Devanahalli constituency on Friday.“The government has paid a compensation of merely Rs 6 lakh to Rs 20 lakh to the farmers here. If the government further asks the farmers to pay the toll, it is unacceptable. I will raise the issue in the cabinet,” said Devanahalli MLA Nisarga Narayanaswamy.‘No dearth of problems’Addressing the event, he said: “There is no dearth of problems in the constituency here. We have to resolve them keeping the time in mind. Citizens should not sit at home after registering their complaints. They should go behind the officials and get them resolved at the earliest.”Rangaswamy G, a resident of the constituency, said: “I had four acres of land in Anneshwara village in survey number 37/21. The KIADB acquired the land. But I have not received a compensation for 20 years. If they provide at least one acre of land, it will help us to eke our livelihood.”Responding to this, Rajanna, tahsildar, said: “Bring the necessary documents to my office on Monday, and we will ensure that justice is done to you.”Another resident, Chandrashekar Balepur said: “The airport authority acquired my grandfather’s land many years ago. Till now, we have not received the compensation. The government is not even considering our applications to provide the compensation.”The tahsildar responded: “If there is no approval from the land acquisition department, we cannot provide the compensation. If you bring the related documents on Wednesday, we can check.”Another group of residents from Murthy Hakkupete, Devanahalli said: “The place where Akash Hospital has been built was at first allotted to build homes for the poor people. Please provide some places for poor people.”The chairman of Murthy Township said: “A case in the court is going on in this regard. Fifty title deeds have been given. But they have not built any houses. If we receive directions from the court, we will act accordingly.”A farmer complained about the BMTC collecting excessing fare in buses. Venkatesh, the leader of a farmer’s association, said: “Due to the toll collected at Devanahalli, the passengers travelling in BMTC buses are shelling out Rs 6 extra every time. Buses going to Chikkaballapur from Bengaluru do not stop at Devanahalli bus stand, inconveniencing passengers. Sometimes, conductors do not allow students with bus passes to board buses.”To this S K Hiremath, BMTC official for Devanahalli replied: “The increase in toll collection is the Central government’s decision. We will make arrangements for buses to stop at bus stops. I will also discuss the matter with the MLA. We will also deploy buses to Vijayapura.”Highlighting lack of streetlights in Devanahalli, G S Raveendra, a member of the town panchayat, said: “From the toll gate to Devanahalli, please provide streetlights as it will help in preventing accidents on the route. Also, put up barricades and build a service road to ease congestion.MLA Nisarga Narayanaswamy said, “We will take necessary measures in the public interest.”“I do not have much experience in politics as I am the first-time MLA. But I am aware of the problems here. I had taken up the issue of excess fare being collected in BMTC buses and it was resolved in the previous meeting. The officials had agreed not to collect the toll from people. I do not know how has this problem resurfaced,” said Nisarga Narayanaswamy.He said in six months, he has received Rs 70 crore fund from the state government for constituency development works and will undertake the work soon.

Five-storeyed building tilts in Marathahalli	tilted dangerously and was on the verge of collapse. Luckily, the BBMP officials rushed to the spot and tackled the situation on Friday.According to the fire control room the incident took place on Thursday late night at Aswath Nagar, 6th Cross, near Marathahalli.“Fire safety advance rescue van and team hit the spot immediately, and stabilised the building with earth movers support,” said Prasadh Reddy, a resident.“A team of building demolishing experts from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike carried out the dismantling of the building structure manually and cautiously. The neighbours and the building occupants were evacuated, and no one was harmed in the process,” Reddy added.Speaking to DH, Assistant Executive Engineer Prakash said: “The building owner violated the rules and constructed ground floor plus four floors. The structure was supposed to have just three floors. As it could not withstand the pressure, the building tilted.”“Now, we are demolishing the building to avoid any further damages. No one was harmed as people evacuated the building soon after the tilt was brought to their notice, Prakash said.“The owner of the building is facing the legal actions, and now he is in police custody,” the officer added.

‘Punish officials who let pollution in lakes’	to Karnataka to identify and punish errant officials who failed to check pollution in Bellanduru, Varthur and Agara lakes.The NGT, which passed an order to restore the major lakes, asked the agencies trusted with the upkeep of the lakes to identify the errant officials and take action. The order also said their lapses should be recorded in their annual confidential reports.The order applies to both present and past officials, the tribunal added, observing that the concerned officials have miserably failed to discharge their obligations to the society.The bench, headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, said the Additional Chief Secretary of the Urban Development Department must identify the officials responsible for implementing the lake revival plan in the coming days.Failure to implement the task should be recorded in the officials’ career progressive records, the tribunal said.Penalties on the publicThe bench also asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to prepare, in a month, guidelines on the scale of penalties on individuals and institutions for non-compliance to control pollution in Bengaluru lakes. The bench also asked the CPCB to prepare guidelines on waste management within one month, Sajan Poovayya, advocate for Namma Bengaluru Foundation, said. Justice Santosh Hegde-headed committee will decide the additional amount required to set up the STPs (Sewage Treatment Plants) to be provided by the state, which is liable to pay interest for delay or non-payment.The tribunal also asked the Karnataka government to follow the May 31, 2018 Panjwani committee recommendations on restoring the lakes.Ram Prasad, the advocate representing JD(S) Rajya Sabha MP Kupendra Reddy said no waste should be disposed in lakes and rajakaluves.

Underpass being repaired to ease traffic at Belegere	for its pathetic condition, so far. But looks like it is on the betterment path now.One of the abandoned underpasses in Belagere is being repaired for the convenience of commuters.One of the underpasses near the Belegere Lake, which the commuters chose not to use as it is in a bad state, is now being restored.“The underpass will be ready for use by two-wheelers by Tuesday. Most of the apartment dwellers staying close to the lake can use the underpass to hit the outer-ring road,” said Pushpa Manjunath, local corporator.All vehicles moving on the Panathur-Belegere road to hit the outer ring road have to pass through another main underpass, where the commuters get stranded for hours together.But now with the repair of the abandoned underpass, the traffic might ease a bit.“The railway underpass on the Panathur-Belegere road is too narrow that only one heavy vehicle can pass through it at a time. Adding to the problem, a large number of water tankers choke the road. Sometimes, it takes more than three hours to get rid of this 1.5 km stretch. Besides, the road is sludgy and slippery,” said Vijay Thomas, a commuter.The residents want the road to be repaired soon.“We need streetlights. Traffic officials need to set some particular time for water tankers as they block the road during peak hours,” he added.“The executive engineer of Mahadevapura divison (major roads) was supposed to pay some amount to the railway department. Now, that he has paid it, the railway department should handover the underpass expansion project to an agency. If that happens, the Panathur-Belegere road is sorted,” said Pushpa Manjunath.

Water expo: extracting the last drop from sewage	and extract the last drop of clean water. At least the entrepreneurs at the Water Expo believe that’s the case.The Expo being held at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC) has more than 70 companies in attendance. They have set up stalls showcasing the latest technology for treating sewage water. From natural treatment to standard mechanical processes to an automated system where one can control a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) sitting on a sofa, an array of exhibits will surely impress water conservationists.A spokesperson for Water Today, which has organised the three-day expo, said water conservation will gain more importance in the coming years as deficiency of rain and depleting ground water will put pressure on policymakers to recycle water.“Twin policies of creating awareness and setting up mandatory STPs will go a long way in reducing water wastage, and checking the pollution of water bodies. We have already realised water can’t be taken for granted. The coming years will see its value go up and rules will be framed accordingly,” he said. Besides home-grown companies, many have come from New Delhi, Chennai and Andhra Pradesh among other places. A Mysuru-based firm exhibited a modular STP that can treat up to 600 litres of sewage per day - offering services on rent.STP automationBengaluru-based K Sridhar and Kannan Pasupathiraj were demonstrating their STP system, built with German technology, that can be monitored online. “The idea is to make an STP as simple and silent as a refrigerator while being adaptable to tanks with a capacity of 1 to 5 kilo litres per day or even more,” said Sridhar.When they realised that people were ready to spend on STPs, but not to hire a person for upkeep, Pasupathiraj decided to add the remote-control mechanism. “Sitting here, I can control the plant we have set up for a company in Chennai,” he said, showing a web page displaying hourly updates on the tank, starting from the state of waste water to its contents as well as the power supply variations.Rohan Rane showcased a model from a Delhi-based firm that employs Phytorid technology devoid of chemicals. He said the simple construction and low-cost tech can be employed to revive lakes as well.Also on display were smart devices that help cut water wastage, and new developments in reverse osmosis technology.

BDA, police clear rundown underside of Hebbal flyover	worried of the rampant illegal activities there anymore.The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) has cleared the clump of shrubs, illegal constructions and the garbage piles below the flyover. They have also cleared the untended thickets in the mini-forest adjacent to the flyover towards the Manyata Tech Park.This was done at the behest of the Bengaluru law and order and traffic police officials. The police were receiving complaints from commuters about the ‘anti-social activities’ in the area.The police have also caught many under suspicious circumstances from under the flyover.“On investigation, the police found that illegal activities were thriving because the area was rundown with shrubbery, and the maintenance was irregular. Since the flyover is still under the custody of the BDA, they approached us. We have cleared all the bushes under the flyover and in the mini-forest too. We have installed street lights as well,” said a senior BDA official.BDA executed the work in the last two days (Tuesday and Wednesday). There is also a plan to deploy security guards under the flyover and in the mini-forest patch near the Kempegowda statue.The BDA will thereafter beautify the area with lawns so that people come for walks. “The idea is that once people start frequenting the place, illegal activities will stop. Since it is en route to the international airport, such occurrences are a blot on the reputation of the city. To make the place look more attractive, public utility services and an amusement park will be introduced in the mini-forest. The area below the flyover will be landscaped as well,” the official added.Around three years ago, BDA started landscaping the area under the flyover. But it did not take off because it was decided to add loops to the flyover.	BDA,Hebbal Flyover,	 Dec 06 2018

This Act does not have specific regulations regarding the financial practices undertaken by the associations.“The societies which fall under the Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972 are not to be registered under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960,” states the circular, as the latter provides registration for promotion of charity, education, science, literature, fine arts, foundation, maintenance of libraries, reading rooms, public museums, galleries and so on, but not for financial practices.Referring to the circular, M K Aiyappa, Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Karnataka State said, “All the apartment complexes, associations or societies charge for maintenance and indulge in other financial activities, but there is no proper regulation if they do not register under Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 or Karnataka Ownership Flat Act, 1972.”The move is important, as the apartment associations can now approach an authorised body to conduct enquiries, if there are any complaints related to financial aspects. Welcoming the move, M S Shankar, secretary, Forum for People’s Collective Efforts said, “This has been a long pending move and we welcome the directive. Most apartment associations are not indulging in any charity related work or welfare, but are collecting maintenance charges only to look after themselves.”“Residents living in apartment complexes own an undivided share of land. They cannot enjoy privileges on the entire complex, as per their desires,” said Shankar. Aiyappa added that some of the apartment associations have already registered under the Act, but for those not registered, it is mandatory to do so under the Karnataka Co-Operative Societies Act or Karnataka Flat Ownership Act, to bring in financial accountability.	apartments,The Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act,	 Dec 04 2018
Get a metro train every 3 mins at Majestic	"am to 10.30 am between Kempegowda and Baiyappanahalli stations. The frequency between trains from Mysore Road will go up from 4 to 5 minutes during this time.The higher frequency is the result of two additional short-loop trains on the line. In a press release, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited said the number of short-loop trips had been increased from 9 to 11 to reduce the crowd at the Kempegowda metro station in Majestic. ""Consequently, the headway from Mysore Road will be 5 minutes instead of the 4 minutes,"" the release said. The corporation will run the six-car train for five trips on the Purple Line between Baiyappanahalli and Mysore Road."	Namma Metro,Kempegowda metro station,	 Dec 04 2018
Lokayukta probe into sand mining at Sarjapur Lake	illegal sand extraction from Doddakere Lake in southeastern Bengaluru’s Sarjapur.Based on news reports about illegal extraction and transportation of sand from the lake, the Lokayukta has initiated an enquiry and has issued notices to the officials concerned, including the superintendent of police, Bengaluru Rural, for immediate action against those indulging in sand extraction.“The news reports indicate that the extraction of sand from Doddakere lake and lake bed has been going on for some time and the officers concerned have failed to act and take appropriate legal action to prevent such illegal extraction of sand. It is needless to point out that illegal extraction of sand is an offence within the meaning of Section 379 of the IPC,” Lokayukta Justice P Vishwanath Shetty stated in the order.The Lokayukta stated that activities concerning minor minerals such as quarrying, extraction and transportation of sand would be in contravention of rules 42 and 44 of KMMC Rules (Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession) as the sand belongs to the state.The residents living around the Doddakere lake, one of the biggest lakes in Anekal taluk, had raised concern about incessant digging at the lake and lake bed area throughout the night. The residents alleged that the local police had not taken any action.Notices issuedThe Lokayukta has issued a notice to Deputy Commissioner (Bengaluru Rural), Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Panchayat Bengaluru Urban district, the Director of Mines and Geology Department and SP Bengaluru Rural.The Lokayukta has asked the deputy commissioner and the Zilla Panchayat chief executive officer to conduct an enquiry. The officers have been directed to submit a report in 10 weeks.	sand extraction,Lokayukta,Sarjapur Lake,	 Dec 04 2018
Six-lane highway will choke Bengaluru, Mysuru	choke both the cities in the future. The increased carriageway will add more vehicles unless the system supports high capacity transport arrangements like a High Speed Rail (HSR) or a Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS), Ashish Verma, an expert at the IISc warned.The Rs 7,000 crore project envisions a six-lane, 117 km-long highway, which includes elevated corridors of about 8 km, and several bridges. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari announced on Friday that the work on the 'economic corridor' will start from January.Verma, Associate Professor of Transport Systems Engineering at the IISc, said though the widened road will help faster mobility between the cities in the beginning, the space will saturate as the vehicle numbers go up.Besides, it is also important to analyse whether the roads within Bengaluru and Mysuru have the capacity to handle the high amount of traffic that the widened roads will bring.“Sustainable urban growth is possible when such capital intensive projects incorporate high capacity systems. Dedicated lanes to support BRTS should be planned. This will ensure that people will eventually shift to public transport. As land acquisition is a major headache, a small patch along the corridor could have been reserved for HSR,” Verma said.The Railway Board is considering a feasibility report for HSR corridor between Chennai and Mysuru via Bengaluru. The proposed HSR is expected to reduce by half the travel duration between Bengaluru and Chennai from five hours to 2 hours and 20 minutes. The Bengaluru-Mysuru commute would come down to less than an hour.Reduce pressure on BengaluruVerma noted that the BRTS and HSR have the capacity to reduce pressure on Bengaluru, which is struggling to support increasing number of industries with limited infrastructure and resources.The high capacity systems that offer reliability will distribute growth to different cities and reduce the burden on Bengaluru. “Alleviating excessively high urban concentration requires investments in inter-regional transport and telecommunications to facilitate deflection of economic activities from megacities,” Verma said in a recent paper.

School vehicles causing traffic chaos in CBD: Motorists	St Mark’s Road is causing traffic chaos, complain motorists.The vehicles that ferry students are parked on the main road though the schools have enough space on their premises. The school buses, vans and other private vehicles parked haphazardly outside many schools in the central business district (CBD) has led to traffic bottlenecks on Brigade Road, MG Road, Richmond Road and surrounding roads. The traffic police have been working hard to beat the problem, every day.Sangeetha Krishnan, a motorist who takes this stretch to go towards MG Road, said, “The main reason for traffic snarls in this stretch is the vehicles lining up to pick up and drop children.”“Parents double-park on the road though parking is restricted. Pedestrians are forced to walk on the road as the footpaths are taken up.”Several schools in the city advanced timing a few years ago from 8 am to 3 pm to avoid clashing with office timings so that there is no traffic congestion around schools.But it has not led to any solution, said Ramesh Reddy, a resident of Lavelle Road. “Cars, private transport vehicles and vans that come to pick up kids continue to stop haphazardly in front of schools. The school management has to control the vehicles and find alternative measures,” he said.The residents also complained about incessant honking and the need to protect schoolchildren from the risk of serious accidents.M N Srihari, a traffic expert and a former advisor to the state government on matters of traffic and infrastructure, said: “These schools are violating the law. There is a rule in the education department that the schools should be given permission only if they have adequate parking area inside there premises.”“Both the school management and the police are not following the rules to avoid the school vans parking on the road. Police have all the right to take action against the school management,” Srihari added.To resolve this rising problem, the city traffic top brass will ask all schools in the CBD to find parking for their vehicles within the campus.Additional Commissioner (Traffic) P Harishekaran said, “We will direct school managements to use the grounds or the adequate space inside the school premises to avoid traffic jams.”	Central Business District,school vehicles,traffic congestion,	 Dec 04 2018
French firm to set up waste-to-energy plant	"waste-to-energy plant of 500 tonnes per day capacity at Chikkanagamangala where waste will be segregated automatically, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara said.Parameshwara, who is touring France to study waste-to-energy management, inaugurated a state-of-the-art waste sorting centre of 500 tonnes per day capacity at Le Puy-en-Velay town in southern France on Sunday. ""The 3 WAYSTE company of France will be setting up a similar facility in Bengaluru, including a waste-to-energy plant of 500 tonnes per day capacity at Chikkanagamangala,” sources close to Parameshwara told DH.According to a press release by Parameshwara, the facility is will be the first-of-its-kind in the world wherein 90% of the mixed waste collected is segregated into different components automatically. Mahendra Jain, additional chief secretary, urban development, and BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad are accompanying Parameshwara in France. “Very impressed by the state-of-the-art facility which segregates 500 tonnes of mixed waste per day,” read a part of a tweet by Parameshwara posted after the inauguration."

Malleswaram senior citizens want footpaths	on the footpaths of Malleswaram on Sunday highlighting the pathetic condition of the pedestrian walkways in the area.Malleswaram Social, a citizen group of the area, a month ago had come up with a Bharatanatyam video, which satirical portrayed the difficulties the residents face while navigating the footpaths in the one of the oldest residential areas of the city.The video had gone viral on the social media platforms. The residents are campaigning for the better footpath under #footpathbeku campaign(we want footpaths) from the last few months.As the second part of the campaign, senior citizens gathered at the 15th Cross at 10 am and took out a short silent walk, to demonstrate the difficulties the senior citizens face while walking on the footpaths.Radhika Prasad, a member of the forum said: “The footpaths in the area are in a bad condition, and most of the walking paths are constructed in an unscientific way where the bumps give senior citizens an uncomfortable walking experience.”Meet corporator, tooThe citizens also meet Manjunath Raju, Kadu Malleswaram corporator, who promised to solve the issues.Suchitra Srinivasan Deep, the co-founder of the platform, said: “Footpaths are the basic necessities for any city. Our footpaths are badly designed, poorly maintained and encroached upon. But none of these seems to really worry the citizens. We have the right to ask for footpath and their maintenance. The administration is not the only stakeholder to be blamed for this. All of us are responsible in some way or the other.”“Hence we have to create awareness among the citizens for the walkable footpath. We hope this campaign will take us together to get a pedestrian-friendly footpath in our area,” she added.	Malleswaram,Footpath,	 Dec 03 2018
Govt land worth Rs 176 cr reclaimed from encroachers	land, Bengaluru District administration on Saturday launched simultaneous encroachment eviction drive in all the five taluks of Bengaluru Urban district.Following a day-long drive against land encroachers led by deputy commissioner of Bengaluru Urban district B M Vijayashankar, a total of 25.26 acres of government land worth Rs 176 crore was recovered.According to sources in the revenue department, the highest extent of encroachment was cleared in Anekal taluk.“A total of 8.61 acres of encroached land worth Rs 36 crore was recovered. All these were the lake areas, located on the periphery of the waterbodies,” said C Mahadevaiah, tahsildar, Anekal.Similarly, in Yelahanka taluk also the officials reclaimed the encroached government land.Even though the locals threatened to stage a protest and gathered in large numbers, the deputy commissioner himself led the officials with police support and reclaimed more than 3 acres of land worth Rs 65 crore.The encroached lands were identified in Puttenahalli, Kogilu and Honnenahalli villages of Yelahanka taluk.	government land,Encroachments,	 Dec 02 2018
BTP moots bus station to fix Silk Board Junction mess	to construct a bus station at the traffic-prone Silk Board junction.Speaking at the “DH & Citizen for Civic amenities” event on Saturday, Additional Commissioner (Traffic) P Harishekaran revealed that his department has conducted a study on the Silk Board junction and found that the one of the main reason for traffic jams on this stretch is buses.“I have voluntarily studied silk board junction traffic chaos. There is a one acre land on the stretch. My officers have proposed to the BDA, BBMP and BMTC to construct a bus station so that the traffic will be reduced,” said P Harishekaran.The traffic police chief also highlighted the need for scientific bus bays in the city. “There is a lack of bus bays hence the buses occupy the service road. For instance, there is no bus bay from Cauvery theatre to International Airport,” he said.“I have approached the BBMP and BMTC to have bus bays while constructing the roads. In the main arterial roads and sub-arterial roads, there are no bus bays. So if two or three buses stop one behind the other there will be a queue of 400 to 500 vehicles,” he added.“For solving the parking problem in the city, the government should bring in a parking policy,” Harishekaran suggested. “We don’t have larger space for public parking in almost all the main areas. We are compromising road space for public parking” he added.Speaking about the elevated corridor project, Harishekaran said, “We have to implement the project as per the government’s direction. I have requested the chief minister to consider having a traffic police,” he said.Bengaluru is expanding in a circular way, unlike Chennai and Mumbai where South-North expansion is prevailing. Therefore, traffic congestion on all the roads is in a circular form, Harishekaran said while dubbing Bengaluru a ‘Chakravyuha’.	Bengaluru Traffic Police,Silk Board,traffic congestion,	 Dec 02 2018
Part of Cottonpete road caves in	Saturday morning, troubling motorists along the stretch.The BBMP officials claimed that a stormwater drain (SWD) pipeline running beneath the road was the cause for the damage.According to N Chidananda, joint commissioner, BBMP, West zone: “A very old SWD runs under the road. This line is minimum 20 feet below the asphalted road and we were not aware of this until now. A thick slab was covering the pipeline and it is fully covered with mud. The BBMP later asphalted the road.”Chidananda also said the SWD was connected with a valley, mostly Vrishabhavathi, and sewage was entering the SWD.“Unfortunately, similar to other cities, most SWDs in our city carry sewage water instead of rainwater and this one in Cottonpete is no different,” he said.The traffic police were the first to swing into action when the road caved in. They barricaded the area, preventing any vehicles or pedestrians from falling into the pit.Later, the BBMP officials came to take measures. “We have taken temporary measures to make the road motorable,” the joint commissioner said.He said a permanent solution to fix the problem would also be taken.“We will coordinate with Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) officials to resolve the issue,” he said.Meanwhile, mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun said she had spoken to BWSSB Chairman Tushar Girinath about the issue.“This SWD under the road may be close to 100 years old. The road should be repaired with much care and precision or the damage could manifold in the coming days,” she said.The BBMP also plans to take up the stretch under its TenderSURE project, where separate utility ducts would be provided for power, underground cables and sewage lines along the side of the road.

After ward meetings, Mayor pushes for zonal level meets	mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun has proposed the officials to hold zonal level meetings across all eight zones.In a letter to Bruhat Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, the mayor has proposed to direct joint commissioners of all zones to hold meetings at zonal levels so that issues get resolved before they reach the BBMP council meeting.Speaking to reporters during the ward committee meeting held at Jayanagar ward on Saturday, she said: “I have asked the commissioner to issue a circular regarding this during the last week. The zonal officials can collate the data gathered from ward committee meetings and try to resolve issues holistically in each zone.”However, this is not the first time that such a move has been made, said Gangambike.“There was a similar proposal long back, during the time of former mayor G Padmavathi. But that proposal was not mooted further. If we indeed implement this move, there will be decentralisation of work and the strength of the council meeting can be utilised for other larger issues,” she said.It is proposed that the zonal level officers can hold such meetings, with the collaboration of officials from other government agencies such as Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited, police and so on, once in two weeks.

Finding solution for Bengaluru traffic	"country, after Kolkata. With 79 lakh vehicles plying on roads meant for just 15 lakh, the city is choking.Citizens for Civic Amenities organised by Deccan Herald for a discussion on the city's traffic woes at the Chancery Pavilion on Saturday. The discussion mainly focused on the reasons and solution for the existing traffic chaos. The prevailing condition is very heartbreaking that the commuters skip buses the moment they can afford two-wheelers and cars. Also, there are just 4,600 officers in the city’s 44 traffic police stations, 662 short of the sanctioned strength of 5,262, says reports. The event was attended by well-known panellists Ashish Verma, Mobility Expert (IIsc), B Basavaaraju IAS (Principal Secretary, Transport department), B Basavaaraju IAS (Transport Department), P Harishekharan IPS ( Bengaluru City Police) and Vinay Srinivasa, Advocate (Citizen activity for Mobility).One of the Panelists Vinay Srinivasa shared data on vehicles in Bengaluru. ""We went from 50 lakh vehicles to 75 lakh in a span of 5 years. In the same period (2013-2018), our BMTC bus fleet expanded by just 50"", says Srinivasa.He also added that the Lack of planning has resulted in the present traffic situation in the city because the planning of residential sectors are not done properly while creating IT & BT sectors. This has led to clogging of roads during morning and evening peak hours in the city. Transport principal secretary B Basavaraju says more coordination is the key to tackling transport issues.Daily commuter Rajashekhar said that the city's infrastructure is good, but for technology to provide solutions, behavioural changes are needed from both city and citizens.

Corporators urge mayor to probe pvt hospitals	to medical negligence by a private hospital, the fellow corporators urged the mayor to conduct a probe, and initiate legal actions against the offenders.During the council meeting on Thursday, the corporators expressed malaise about Elumalai’s health.Elumalai,the corporator of Sagayapuram, who went to get a small abscess removed from his nose, slipped into a coma after an alleged medical negligence.According to reports, his family alleged that anaesthesia overdose was responsible for this condition and sought the hospital be shut. He was admitted to Santhosh hospital in Frazer Town from where he was shifted to Vikram hospital.The fellow corporators during the meeting said many such hospitals have turned into ‘death centres’. They urged the mayor to initiate an investigation into all the private hospitals in the city and cancel the trade licenses of those involved in unlawful activities.They also sought mayor Gangambike to get the official medical report of Elumalai, investigate and initiate legal actions against Santhosh hospital to which the mayor agreed.The corporators also said the government should keep a watch on medical camps organised by non-government organisations (NGOs).“Many NGOs conduct medical camps without a no-objection certificate from the BBMP. So the BBMP should consider this issue and prevent any medical tragedies in future,” said one of the corporators.The mayor said the investigation into the private hospitals needs to be carried out by the principal secretary or commissioner of health and family welfare services, health secretary or commissioner.“I will bring the matter to their notice,” said Gangambike.

Better access means more water consumption in city	per person a day is an acceptable limit for water consumption. But Bengaluru residents are consuming a much higher volume of water daily.Individual consumption in several areas in the city has been averaging over 200 litres. Experts attribute proximity to the storage area, better access and economic strata as factors influencing water consumption. A R Shivakumar, Principal Scientific Officer, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology said that on an average, an individual might require about 96 litres of water for domestic consumption daily.“The supply of water differs in various parts of the city. While some have supply every alternate day, other areas get it only once in three days,” he said.He added that those living close to reservoirs or pumping stations have a better water supply.According to Shivakumar the rise in the number of multi-storey buildings could also be a contributor. “What was once a single house could now have several floors but only one water connection. This could also reflect as high consumption,” he said adding that one must also take into account, consumption of water from other sources.Dr Kemparamaiah, Chief Engineer, BWSSB said that the disparity in water consumption could be dependent on several factors. “They might not have sought a BWSSB connection. Some of them have old pipes and with some it could be case-specific issues,” he said.He said that Bengaluru’s water consumption was unlike other cities including Singapore, Delhi or Hyderabad. “Some of them have access to bore wells while multi-storey buildings get water from tankers,” he added.

BMRCL seeks $500M loan for airport metro	with the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) seeking a loan worth 500 million USD. The BMRCL will also request Rs 500 crore as aid from the Centre. The move comes after a proposal to raise funds through the User Development Fee (UDF) has been put off.Managing Director Ajay Seth said the corporation is looking for the $500 million, ideally in a long-term loan of up to 20 years with a moderate interest rate. The formal request for a loan has to go through the Union government. “We have held a discussion with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The request is yet to be sent to the Union government,” he said.The BMRCL is trying to shore up funds for the project after the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) in June blocked a proposal to raise Rs 1,000 crore through UDF. As per the AERA ruling, additional UDF can be levied after the metro services begin.The corporation will also seek Rs 500 crore from the Centre as per the new metro policy, where the Union government will provide 10% of the cost for a project, raising funds through innovative financing models.As per the financial plan approved by the cabinet, the state government is expected to pitch in Rs 1,250 crore, and the Centre, Rs 500 crore (8.40% of the project’s cost).The alignment of the metro line to the airport is likely to be revised with the BMRCL planning to connect the line at Hebbal instead of Nagavara.

Pipe-laying, white-topping congest BTS road	wait for at least three more months for a smooth ride.Due to the ongoing pipe-laying by the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), and the scheduled Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) work, motorists and pedestrians are having a difficult time.While the BWSSB is laying new sanitary pipelines along the road, the BBMP is to begin the white-topping project next week.The BWSSB’s work in progress has resulted in huge piles of mud dumped along the side of the road.A shopkeeper in the area, who did not wish to be named said, “The number of customers visiting our shop has reduced, due to the huge mud-pile that is like a wall, blocking visibility.”Raksha Uday, a regular commuter said, “The BWSSB has dug up deep trenches to lay pipelines. It is next to impossible for pedestrians to walk on the road. Only motorists and cars can move.”According to D Chandrappa, area councillor of the Hombegowda Nagar ward, the work is expected to continue for at least three more months.“The BWSSB is replacing the sanitary pipelines with new ones, as there was reverse flow of sewage during rains. This was leading to severe clogging. We are re-laying the new pipeline as a solution to the existing problem,” said Chandrappa.He also said that the BWSSB work has to be completed before the BBMP can start the white-topping.“Recently, we have filled potholes on the road. But the white-topping will take some time and we are hoping to complete the BWSSB work before that,” he said.Recently, the BBMP received clearance from Bangalore Traffic Police to divert the traffic on the BTS road to alternative roads, so that the civic body can undertake the work. BBMP will white-top the stretch from KH road to Mico road, and the traffic will be diverted to the 12th cross road, Wilson Garden.	Road congestion,	 Nov 25 2018
Elevator safety: Rising high and falling low	open spaces although the compromise is very often criticised for leaning heavily in favour of spreading the concrete cover rather than green. Naturally, this leads to land price hike, high population concentration and a struggle to retain green cover. All of these have led to a rise in high-rise buildings, and by implication, elevators.Increase in building height necessitates innovative technologies to ensure optimal use of space and user convenience. Safety being the top priority, considerable effort is required to choose the right technology for elevators.Interactions by DH at many apartments showed this emphasis on safety: This clearly came through at Sanathana Chamanthi, Seegehalli, near Kadugodi, at Krishna Prakash apartments of Aicoboonagar, at Nandi Enclave of Banashankari 3rd stage, and at VVR Supreme Residency of Uttarahalli. Apartment association members were all fully aware of the critical link between safety and good maintenance of elevations. Some of them had separate committees or even external managers for the job.Many also prefer to go for an annual maintenance contract (AMC) with the company that instals the elevator in the apartment. Shilpa T, an MNC employee residing in Seegehalli informs that her complex with four apartments is fitted with Aero-LIFT elevators. “The Aero-LIFT company itself has been handed the responsibility of maintaining the elevators,” she says.But not all apartments score high on lift safety. Kishor Kumar P, secretary of the Bank Officers’ Cooperative Housing Society, Aicoboonagar, draws attention to flat owners who opt for smaller, local, and possibly lower quality companies for elevator maintenance. “Most of them naturally do it to economise on the construction cost, even if the elevators had been initially installed by a much better known and higher quality company,” he elaborates.A representative of a leading elevator manufacturer in the country concurs: “An AMC with the supplying company can be considered ideal but sometimes, builders go for cheaper options. The maintenance work is handed over to smaller, local companies,” he says.“There are many safety parameters that need to be met during installation and maintenance of elevators. While no company in Bengaluru forgoes such parameters, we cannot say so for certain when it comes to maintenance by local brands. They might bypass some of these parameters to do the job at a lesser expenditure,” explains the representative. “There is every chance that this would prove dangerous.”Use of the right kind of cables and switches is necessary, depending upon the elevator of the building, says the representative. “One can still see smaller companies using slightly lower quality cables but the front-runners in installation of elevators always insist on using armoured cables,” he explains.A few apartments go beyond the mandated rules to doubly secure lift safety. For instance, additional safety measures were taken at Krishna Prakash apartments, where the elevators were provided alarms and cameras, informs Kishor Kumar. Karthik, who works at Rockline Centre, Trinity Circle, recalls how the elevators were shut down during floods to prevent damage and electrical mishaps.Builders and management also need to ensure the elevators are user-friendly for all users. Shilpa recalls that the elevators at her apartment in Seegehalli had got stuck in between floors. “The sensors did not work for some time and we were forced to change the elevator usage plan. Housekeeping work too sometimes affects the working of the elevators as daily waste is piled up near the lift entrance,” she adds.Senior citizens and the physically challenged have to struggle to use elevators that are poorly installed or do not meet certain requirements. While the door of an elevator has to be more than 700 mm wide to fit in a wheelchair, many builders are seen compromising on the width due to space shortage.When an elevator gives room only to stand, use of such an elevator proves a problem to the physically challenged, even if they are not wheelchair-bound.But there are others who hesitate getting into a lift out of fear of a fall or a bit of nausea as the lift ‘takes off’. Fitness freak Shankar gives another perspective, “A lift is the comparatively more preferred means of transport as against the ‘safer’ and ‘healthier’ stairs. This is so even for many who are fit enough to walk up a couple of floors.”	Elevators,	 Nov 25 2018
City headed for severe water crisis, says DyCM	"Bengaluru is headed for severe drinking water crises in the near future.Speaking at the Janaspandana, a civic grievance redressal event organised by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, Parameshwara said there is no further plans to assure water supply to the constantly expanding city beyond the fifth stage of the Cauvery Water Supply Scheme.""The city is growing rapidly and may face water crises in the future,"" Parameshwara, also the Bengaluru Development Minister said. ""We have to find a solution soon. People should start saving water to solve future crises,"" he added.The Cauvery Water Supply Scheme aims to build a comprehensive water and sewerage network to treat 775 mld of raw Cauvery water at a new plant, to be set up in Thorekadanahalli and pumped to the Harohalli and Tataguni pumping stations. From there, water would be supplied to the city.Water supply will be split to the west and east side.

""Under the Yettinahole drinking water project, Bengaluru will get only 2.5 TMC of water.

LED lamps to replace sodium vapor streetlights in 2 yrs	all sodium vapour street lamps to LED lights in the next two years to save about 80% of energy. A dedicated control room will also be set up to monitor the functioning of street lights. Addressing the Janaspandana programme, a civic grievance redressal event organised by the BBMP, Palike commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said, “Since we are receiving several complaints from the residents about dysfunctional of street lights, the BBMP will convert five lakh sodium vapour street lamps with LED bulbs. The decision will be taken at the upcoming Cabinet meeting.”The civic body is now paying an electricity bill of Rs 20 crore annually and about Rs 50 crore a year for maintaining street lights. “After installing LED lights, the centralised control room will track the condition of streetlights. If any LED light is fused, the control room personnel will alert the ground staff to repair it immediately,” he added.Prasad assured citizens that there will be no streetlight complaints when this project is completed in two years.Hard to get RTI replyTo address grievances of residents of east Bengaluru, BBMP organised Janaspandana.Garbage crisis, traffic congestion, commercialisation of residential areas, water scarcity were some of the problems the residents highlighted.Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara, Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun and officials heard the grievances at Town Hall.Srinivas, a resident, complained that officials were not providing RTI replies. “I applied for RTI seeking information one-and-a-half years ago. I have not received any reply so far,” he said.The BBMP commissioner replied, “We will review the complaint and take necessary action if RTI is not replied by officials.”Another resident complained that officials were not available in the offices to solve their grievances.

Seized vehicles clog sidewalks in Jeevan Bima Nagar	and the traffic police station which is right across the road, are crammed with seized vehicles, causing deep distress to the pedestrians.Either side of the road are now stuffed with vehicles seized for violating norms. The situation has turned into a nightmare for pedestrians, as they are deprived of sidewalks on the Jeevan Bima Nagar main road. Ironically, the scenario seems to be the new normal for sidewalks near many traffic police stations in the city. Many seized vehicles have become a regular fixture in the vicinity of a traffic police station.When DH visited Jeevan Bima Nagar, more than a dozen trashed cars were found abandoned on the sidewalk, stretching for almost 500 meters on either direction from the respective stations towards the immediate traffic signal.Another road adjacent to the traffic police station which leads to various residential neighbourhoods in Jeevan Bima Nagar has footpaths clogged with vehicles -- predominantly two-wheelers.Pedestrians feel the traffic police are violating their space. “The footpaths have been in a similar state for more than seven years now,” a regular commuter told DH.The issue is also a major safety concern. “We have to literally stand on the main road to wait for vehicles to clear. If there was a footpath, it would have been safer and easier,” said Navya Kumari, a resident. According to the sub-inspector, traffic, Jeevan Bima Nagar, the residents understand the situation. “They know we do not have any empty space granted specially to park the seized vehicles. We are forced to park vehicles on footpaths,” he said. “We do understand the problem the pedestrians are facing, but we are also helpless. The government should sanction us some empty space around or close by to the station,” he added.	Bengaluru,Jeevan Bima Nagar,traffic,	 Nov 24 2018

India first: KIA's automated 'self bag drop' system	to complete your baggage check-in at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). The Bengaluru airport on Thursday became the first in India to introduce a fully automated 'self-bag drop' system.For now, the facility will be available only for passengers of Air Asia and SpiceJet. KIA operator Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) has deployed 16 fully-automated Self Bag Drop machines. This, says BIAL, will significantly accelerate the baggage transaction and reduce check-in queues.Designed and installed by Materna IPS, the facility will be expanded to more airlines in the near future.How it works:The Self Bag Drop employs a two-step approach. A passenger will first print a boarding pass and an eezee-tag (bag tag) at a self-check-in kiosk. Once tagged, the passenger will go to the bag drop machine, scan the boarding pass to initiate the bag drop process. The bag will be measured, weighed, scanned and automatically fed into the baggage handling system.A total of 32 new self-check-in kiosks will be installed to print boarding pass and baggage tags. “These kiosks have been specially designed for the Bengaluru Airport. In the case of excess baggage, the passenger will be directed to a hybrid counter to complete the check-in and payment,” informs a BIAL spokesperson.However, the spokesperson adds, multiple payment gateway options for excess baggage will be integrated into the machines at a later stage as part of the technology enhancement.Besides reducing waiting time, the automated system is expected to help airlines cut their staff strength in the long run. Currently, at least two personnel are deployed by the airlines to complete the check-in system. At the airline counter, an assistant issues the boarding pass once the ticket is verified, while another tag the baggage to be checked in.The new technology will change this system. “India’s airports are being confronted with growth of up to 25% right now and have expansion plans to match. However, they have to make the best possible use of their existing infrastructure as extensions and new buildings take too long. The self-service project at KIA is the first of its kind in India, says Shibu Mathews, head of Materna in India.	Kempegowda International Airport,	 Nov 15 2018
Govt fails to regulate private bus fares	government has failed to keep its promise of curbing private bus operators from charging exorbitant fares during rush days.Private buses make hay during long weekends and holidays, when railways and state transport buses cannot keep up to the commuters demands, by charging twice or thrice the fares on popular routes.In the run-up to Deepavali, private bus fares went up by more than 100% on longer routes, especially those bound to Hubballi, Belagavi, Hyderabad and Mangaluru. Sleeper bus fares to Hubballi went up to Rs 2,200, against the regular fare of Rs 800.On November 2, 3 and 5, Regional Transport Department officials booked 1517 private bus operators across the state, including 946 in Bengaluru. Officials said the cases were based on a violation of the contract carriage permit conditions. However, the issue of exorbitant fares during the long weekend and festive rush has remained unresolved.Additional Transport Commissioner C P Narayanaswamy said there were two major violations of the permit, including carrying of parcel luggage and picking up passengers from places between the origin and destination.“About Rs 15 lakh pending taxes and Rs 1.5 lakh of compounding fee was collected. Additionally, we have seized 17 buses, against whom tax of Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh was pending. Some of these buses did not have a fitness certificate. Fine was also imposed on several buses for various violations,” he said.Asked whether cases were booked specifically for high fares, Narayanaswamy said action can be taken against such practices only if the government approves such a rule. “We have taken statements from passengers in these buses for clear proof for exorbitant fares. Some were paying Rs 1,600 for a ticket that cost not more than Rs 700 earlier. But we can’t file cases till the government approves a proposal for fare fixation,” he said.Sources in the Transport Department said a proposal for fixing minimum and maximum fares for such buses was pending with the government for several months. “Fixing fares will also help bring down other violations. The decision has to be taken at a government level,” the source said.	private bus,	 Nov 07 2018
BBMP invites bids multi-level car park, Kidwai hospital	"set to get relief from parking problems. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has invited bids for building another multi-level parking complex at the hospital. The three-storey complex will cost Rs 14 crore to build and will accommodate 150 cars and 100 two-wheelers. The project was sanctioned in the BBMP's 2017-18 budget. M K Gunashekar, the then chairman of the BBMP's standing committee on tax and finance, had inspected the hospital and felt it needed adequate parking space. Speaking to DH, Gunashekar said his visit had followed a request from the hospital's director to find a solution to the parking problem. Established in 1973, Kidwai is the premier state-run cancer hospital in Karnataka and sees thousands of patients and their attendants every day. The parking complex will replace an old structure which is located behind the main building but is within the hospital's larger compound, a BBMP official said. According to Kidwai director C Ramachandra, the hospital sees at least 1,000 vehicles every day. Some outpatients and their relatives also drive in. ""But there is no parking space. The multi-level car park will help both patients and the hospital staff,"" he told this newspaper. Freedom Park car park The multi-level parking complex at the Freedom Park in the heart of Bengaluru will not open by December as the work is far from over. The project began in 2015 and has already missed three deadlines. The Rs 79-crore complex, which would accommodate 500 cars and as many two-wheelers, will open only in March 2019. A BBMP official said the bottom surface consisted of a rock that had to be drilled, causing the delay. In March, the then chief minister Siddaramaiah had inaugurated the half-built complex just before the Assembly elections."	Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology,	 Nov 07 2018
2,965 vehicles caught dumping garbage	Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to initiate criminal action against those who throw garbage in places cleaned by pourakarmikas, the BBMP marshalls have caught 2,965 vehicles for dumping garbage in the eight zones in the last seven days.The BBMP zone joint commissioner will file cases in the police station soon. Speaking to DH, BBMP Additional Commissioner (Health) D Randeep said, “The court has directed the BBMP to catch the vehicles involved in the illegal dumping of garbage on the black spot and file criminal case in the local police stations. The case will also be filed against the owners of the vehicles with the help of vehicle registration numbers.”According to the available data, the civic body marshalls have caught 1,023 two-wheelers, 128 three wheelers, 71 light motor vehicles, 22 trucks and 33 tractors between November 1 to 7.As per the High Court direction to bring down the number of black spots, the BBMP had beautified the black spots by drawing rangolis during Kannada Rajyotsava with an aim to clear at least five black spots in each ward.	garbage dumping,	 Nov 07 2018
Geotag toilets: BBMP dither over creating awareness	"All you need to do is to type the word 'toilet' in Google Maps, which would direct you to the nearest place to ease yourself.While the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike made efforts to geotag public toilets, it did very little to create awareness about the initiative. That meant many city dwellers are largely in the dark about the facility.In September, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MoHUA) teamed up with tech giant Google to launch the #LooReview campaign to geotag public toilets in all urban local bodies in the country.One of the main objectives of the #LooReview campaign was to make people aware how accessible public toilets are in urban areas. Besides locating them in Google Maps, the option to review them also help their maintenance.In reality, however, the BBMP is yet to begin a social media campaign to bring the spotlight on the mapping of the toilets.Sapna Karim, who heads civic participation in Janaagraha, says the reluctance to publicise toilet mapping could be because their numbers are still minimal.""The BBMP is still falling behind the number of toilets to meet the Swachh Bharat targets. Another reason why it hasn't publicised the toilet availability is their poor maintenance. Many of them don't have a functioning flush and adequate lighting, among other things,"" Sapna said.A recent survey by Jaanagraha revealed that the city has more toilets in the inner wards and few in the periphery. It is also falling behind the 1,100 toilets fixed on the basis of the population figures.Randeep D, BBMP's special commissioner for solid waste management, said the civic body would launch the awareness drive since it has already geotagged the toilets. ""We'll start the awareness campaign sometime next week,"" he added.The campaign is one of the key factors for the city to get better rankings in the Swachh Survekshan survey. Lack of awareness about public toilets cost the city crucial points and made it slide down the rankings last time around. We have to keep our fingers crossed to know how it fairs this year."

Private buses create traffic chaos on Tumakuru Road	private buses, restricted to the flyover, returning to the road.The buses have a contract carriage permit that prohibits them from picking up passengers between the origin and destination points. But most of the 1,500 buses stop at several locations within the city limits and this leads to traffic jams.Since Tumakuru Road is the major entry and exit point between Bengaluru and the northern parts of the state, the traffic police had imposed restrictions to end the menace created by contract carriage buses.Last year, City Police Commissioner T Suneel Kumar issued rules for such buses. “Private contract carriage buses are barred from operating at Peenya, Jalahalli Cross and 8th Mile. They have to mandatorily ply on the flyover from Goraguntepalya,” he said, while making an exception for the buses entering Bengaluru.The order was passed on March 26 under Section 116 of the Central Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. However, its validity was limited to a month unless published in the state gazette.“The order never appeared in the gazette. We checked with officials in the section concerned and they said they never received it,” said a source in the transport department.The buses, earlier banned on the grade-level road, gradually started picking passengers from the service road and the main road below the flyover, the traffic police said.“We know contract carriage buses stop along the road to pick passengers. The artificial traffic jams they create are a regular headache. But stopping them is the job of RTO officials,” a policeman said.Officials from the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) were the first to complain to the police.“This was the same time when we were planning to shift a majority of services from the Kempegowda bus station in Majestic to the Peenya satellite station. As private buses avoided the flyover, we knew they would illegally pick up half the passengers who would have taken public transport,” a senior official said.	Tumakuru Road,traffic,	 Nov 05 2018
BBMP issues khata for CA site, sanctions building plan	to protect a Civic Amenity (CA) site, despite the Anti-Corruption Bureau’s (ACB) preliminary inquiry proving that BBMP officials illegally issued a khata and plan sanction for it. The CA site is in Amara Jyoti House Building Co-operative Society in Domlur.Based on a request by the Society, Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had notified certain lands for acquisition, including 4.05 acres of land in survey numbers 68/1 and 68/2. The compensation for it was also disbursed. In the BDA-approved layout plan, an extent of 18 guntas of land in survey number 68/2 was earmarked and shown as CA site for park and road.A complaint filed by a Domlur resident, B Shivashankar, stated that a developer, Sunil Gupta has begun construction at the site after obtaining a khata and building plan. Shivashankar alleged that the developer made a representation before the BBMP authorities seeking khata and plan sanction for construction of a commercial building by falsely stating that the extent of 18 guntas of land, which is in fact in survey number 68/2, is in survey number 68/1.Documents reveal that based on a request by the original owner of the land in survey number 68/1, the state government had dropped 1.12 acres of land from acquisition.However, in 1996, special land acquisition officer (SLAO) again acquired 38 guntas of land in survey number 68/1. Subsequently, in 2005 Guramma filed an application seeking khata in her name for the 24 guntas of land in survey number 68/1. When the BBMP sought an opinion, the SLAO in a letter reiterated that the land was part of the acquisition and handed over to the society.“The BBMP revenue officials on the pretext of seeking a second opinion created a fake note from SLAO saying the land was not part of the acquisition. Based on this letter, the BBMP officials, concealing the fact that the said land falls in survey number 68/2, cleared the sketch and spot inspection and issued a khata in favour of Guramma in 2006,’’ an official said.Before the khata was issued, Guramma had executed a sale agreement for the land with Sunil Gupta’s wife for a consideration of Rs 5.22 crore. Subsequently, the property was sold between Sunil Gupta and his wife in 2007. Acting on the complaint by Shivashankar, the BBMP has asked the developer not to continue the construction work and also to produce documents for an inquiry. BBMP Joint Commissioner and DC (east) were not available for a comment.	BBMP,BDA,	 Nov 03 2018
Garbage black spot cleared on Kanakapura Road	in Bengaluru South division has collected about Rs 5000 with the help of marshals and night guards keeping vigil and preventing people from dumping garbage on a probable lake bed on Kanakapura Main Road.Located opposite H M Tambourine, an apartment complex, the spot was a major headache for residents for many years as garbage was regularly dumped there. After several attempts to clean up a patch of the lake bed, the residents collected funds up to Rs 1.25 lakh and erected barricades and painted the area to prevent the dumping of waste.On October 28 the residents invited an NGO- 'Way for Life' to help them barricade the place and paint along with some music and songs. The patch of land where people used to cover their nose and walk was freed of the bad odour since Sunday.Aleem, a resident of the apartment complex, said that the credit must go to the BBMP staff who are helping in keeping the place clean. “It is not easy to keep vigil at night only to prevent people from dumping garbage. Besides guarding the place, the BBMP health inspector has also fined many persons who dump the garbage,” he added.Mahesh, the health inspector, said that he has taken up the task of cleaning the place and preventing all probable black spots in his area of work. “We have fined many educated people who come in the night to dump garbage, I have not spared anyone and ensured the fine amount is collected. I have also asked many of these defaulters to send their photo the next day when they are handing over their garbage to our vehicle,” he added.	BBMP,Garbage crisis,	 Nov 03 2018
Varthur Lake to get marshalls soon	garbage dumping and encroachments.The Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA) commissioner had written to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) requesting it to deploy marshalls at the Varthur Lake similar to the Bellandur Lake.“As an extension of the initiative taken up by you for the Bellandur Lake, I request you to deploy marshals for the Varthur Lake also in the interest of the waterbody,” his letter written on October 27 said.Speaking to DH, Rakesh Singh, BDA Commissioner, said “I had a word with the BBMP commissioner about deploying the marshalls at the Varthur Lake. This may take a few days. The BBMP is very positive about deploying the marshalls.”In March 2018, the civic body had deputed retired army men as lake marshals at the Bellandur Lake. Around 24 marshals are keeping an eye round-the-clock in three shifts. The civic body pays them an honorarium also. They patrol the 960-acre lake, covering 27 km, every day.Meanwhile, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said: “BDA has asked for marshalls at the Varthur Lake similar to the Bellandur Lake. I have already instructed the officials to make arrangement to deploy the ex-servicemen.”“In a week, we will have about 10 marshalls working there in three shifts with Prahari vehicles” he added.The Varthur Lake is the second largest waterbody spread across 445-acre and is also one of the most polluted lakes in the city. The lake ecosystem is polluted because of sewage water and illegal dumping of garbage and debris.	garbage dumping,Varthur Lake,Bangalore Development Authority (BDA),Encroachments,	 Nov 03 2018
BDA: low water, but Bellandur Lake not drying up	up of Bellandur Lake, BDA officials inspected the waterbody and clarified the lakebed hadn’t dried up.The water level had reduced at some places in the past few days as sluice gates were opened and a lot of water had drained out of the lake, they claimed. “There has been a prolonged dry spell over the past few weeks as we had left the sluice gates open for some reasons. We have closed the sluice gates downstream. Now that the water has filled up till the waste weir level, we may not see dry patches in the lake bed,” said B A Shivananda, engineering officer, BDA.Residents alerted the BDA on October 28 shortly after finding some dry patches in the lakebed. “The lake may be encroached on if more of the lakebed shows up. BDA says the drying up is a result of sluice gates being left open for some days, but we are not aware of it,” said Sonali Singh, of Bellandur.Lake experts attributed the reduced water to the diversion of treated water to Kolar under the KC Valley project. “Huge amounts of silt is deposited on the lakebed and the lake cannot hold water now. The treated water being diverted to Kolar could be behind the reduced water level. Reduced sewage inflow to the lake is another reason,” said a lake expert, preferring anonymity.The BDA has submitted an action plan to the NGT about desilting Bellandur Lake, its commissioner Rakesh Singh said. But residents want desilting to start on one side of the lake soon so the lake doesn’t dry up.	Bellandur Lake,BDA,	 Nov 03 2018

It is a huge task for the civic body to collect and dispose of garbage on a daily basis,"" he added.He said the government is considering both short- and long-term solutions for solid waste management. For now, the civic body has roped in NGOs, Residents' Welfare Associations (RWAs), besides engaging marshals, to clear the black spots, while it plans to set up a control room to monitor and resolve issues at the ward level.The BBMP is also planning to deploy one assistant executive engineer and a senior health officer to each Assembly constituency to look after solid waste management.

Neglected footpaths on Old Airport Road imperil seniors	her leg on her way to a medical shop near Manipal Hospitals on the Old Airport Road.She had to get her knee treated. “Not just me, a lot of senior citizens living here struggle to navigate that footpath. It’s busy but remains in bad condition,” she said.Seniors living in the vicinity of Old Airport Road concur with Saraswathi, describing traversing the two-kilometre footpath as a nightmare. Despite more than 10,000 pedestrians using the footpath every day, it remains in a dilapidated condition. The footpath has gaping holes in places where the slabs are missing, while the cement blocks along the way cause obstruction. Besides, vendors have set up shop and the optical fibre cables hang down from tree branches in some sections. Basavanna (62) who resides on Old Airport Road said it is nearly impossible to traverse the footpath in the night time. “I live alone with my wife and have to walk down the footpath to buy grocery and other things as my wife can’t walk. The footpath is damaged and is encroached at a few places,” he said.The condition of other footpaths in the HAL Airport ward in the BBMP’s Mahadevapura zone is no better. Residents lament that they remain in disrepair despite complaints to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).Palike officials, on the other hand, attributed their inability to repair the footpath to lack of funds.“We’d have repaired them by now if only we have got the funds,” a BBMP official said. BBMP chief engineer Parameshwariah told DH that the government provides Rs 2 to Rs 3 crore for each ward according to the ward budget. “I’ll direct HAL ward corporator to utilize the funds to repair the footpath,” he said.	footpath damage,potholes,Bengaluru,	 Nov 02 2018
Need ID cards immediately: marshals tell BBMP	"littering, have demanded that the BBMP issue identity cards at the earliest.Citing persistent demands to establish their identity, many are humiliated over handling issues on the ground. The former servicemen have warned they may not turn up for work, if their demand is not met immediately.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and the Bangalore Development Authority have deployed around 400 former servicemen, NCC and ACC cadets in Bellandur and Varthur lakes, abandoned quarries and solid waste management sites.In fact, the BBMP is now working to deploy two marshals in each of the city's 198 wards to wipe out the garbage black spots.

""People don't take us seriously and ask what powers we have to stop them from littering and slapping fines. Surprisingly, such questions are raised by educated citizens.""Marshals carry an authorisation letter from the BBMP, stating that they have the powers to stop and penalise offenders.

Parameshwara lashes out over garbage crisis	complaints from citizens on the garbage mess, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara hauled Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials over their cavalier attitude in addressing the worsening crisis across the city. Accompanied by the Mayor, the BBMP Commissioner and other senior officials, Parameshwara on Friday took stock of the situation in every zone. Patiently sitting through presentations spanning several hours, Parameshwara lost his cool when officials briefed him that engineers refuse to attend to the garbage problem. A senior official, who was part of the meeting, told DH that he lashed out at the senior officials for messing up the administration.“Transfer 13 assistant engineers from the planning section to manage garbage disposal with immediate effect. If they refuse to report for duty, repatriate them to their mother departments and we will get a few other engineers from other departments. We have already sent back 30 engineers to the PWD. Should we (state government) get rapped by the High Court because of your callous and shoddy work? What did we gain after having spent several crores on garbage? Can’t you all discharge your duties as desired?” Parameshwara reportedly chided the officials of the Solid Waste Management (SWM) section of BBMP.Failing to implement his previous instructions, an assistant executive engineer of South division (Yeshwantpur) also received flak. “The main road in Yeshwantpur is infested with bushes and weeds on either side. I had told the officer to clear the bushes and manage it properly. But to date, the situation has been the same. If you can not listen to what I say, why do we need officials like you,” Parameshwara reportedly said to the official. Revealing that the recent audit of the SWM wing in BBMP had revealed several discrepancies Parameshwara reportedly said, “There has been a huge mismatch between the number of workers shown on the list and the actual number of workers working at the ward level. Besides, regular autos and tippers have also been added to the list as garbage vehicles which do not exist in reality. We will soon order a CID inquiry into these irregularities and culprits will be dealt with severely.”	Garbage crisis,G Parameshwara,BBMP,	 Nov 02 2018
Discrepancy on pothole reports by BBMP and Commission	that it has posted all the details about the pothole filling work done so far on their website. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari was hearing a petition on the potholes in the city. However, the court commission submitted that their inspection of the ongoing work by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike (BBMP) painted a different picture on the quality of work. It said that the current work in some areas is as per the technical specifications. The court commission's report on pothole inspection is below: The court orally observed that the court commission has to intervene for the BBMP to do its job. It further stated that an engineer from another branch has to tell BBMP engineers on basic specifications with regard to filling the potholes. The court added that Bengaluru must have motorable roads. The bench further stated that traffic in the city has expanded beyond the capacity of the roads and the alternative looks like another road but that also has to be motorable.The BBMP also submitted that they will work together with BWSSB to address the issue of potholes. The court then asked the BBMP to inform the court commission as to which areas it will undertake the filling of potholes from Saturday to November 2. The court also asked BBMP to file a progress report on the work done with regard to SWDs from Saturday till November 2.HC to hear petitions on Bengaluru civic infrastructure on SaturdaysThe Karnataka High Court plans to dedicate Saturdays to hear petitions seeking to address issues on civic infrastructure. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari will hear petitions regarding pressing issues concerning the cleaning and maintenance of stormwater drains, removal of flexes and hoardings and potholes on Saturdays.The decision came after the bench observed that these petitions need a detailed hearing and hearing them on weekdays is taking a toll on the hearing of other petitions.The poor state of garbage cleaning in the city by BBMP was also cited in the commission's report. The court orally asked the BBMP Commissioner to ensure that the city is garbage-free by October 31.	Karnataka High Court,potholes,BBMP,	 Oct 27 2018
BBMP’s failure to fill all potholes riles HC	for its failure to fill all potholes in the city by October 23 and rejected the civic body’s claim of considerable progress. A division bench led by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, hearing a PIL petition on potholes, noted that the BBMP’s incompetence was affecting the court’s functioning as other matters were held up. The deadline was set by the court at the last hearing. The court got to know the BBMP didn’t meet the deadline when the petitioner identified at least 43 potholes. Clearly disappointed, the court said it had expected the BBMP to submit that the city was free of potholes. The court rejected the BBMP counsel’s submission that the civic body was still filling potholes and that there had been considerable progress. The bench ordered the BBMP to fill the 43 potholes by 1.30 pm.The civic body later informed the court that it had filled only 14 of them and that 24 were in areas where the BBMP had dug up roads. “If the BBMP cannot do it, some other agency will do it and this will come through an order after announcing BBMP as a failure and it will come with a heavy price,” the court said. Observing that the civic body had proved its incompetence, the court further orally said: “If BBMP does not work, it does not mean the city will shut down. It only means BBMP will shut down.” Inspection tomorrowThe court directed the two-member commission it had appointed earlier to inspect the areas where the BBMP was filling potholes and submit a report on Thursday. It asked the BBMP to cooperate in the inspection. The court noted that the pothole case was affecting the adjudication of other matters. It said it would hear the pothole case on Saturdays and orally observed that the BBMP commissioner must pay the allowance of court officers on such days. The court asked senior counsel Aditya Sondhi to request the coordination committee headed by the chief secretary to take the pothole issue on priority.	BBMP,Karnataka High Court,Pothole,	 Oct 23 2018
Poor lift facility: REVA students delay for class	to their classes on time. Having eight floors, the university campus has only two lifts for thousands of students.Students feel the management is deliberately negligent towards their grievance for many years, forcing them to take the steps to reach the classrooms on time.A student requesting anonymity told DH, “We are crammed inside the lift. The lifts can accommodate a maximum of 20 people at a time, but they take in more than 25, putting our lives at risk. We don’t have any other option. There is also a separate time for us to use lift. Even if someone is severely ill or injured we are not allowed to take the lift until we submit a medical certificate. Sometimes we fall sick while in college. It gets difficult for female students during their periods. We have approached the authorities many times, but nothing has changed.”Students also alleged that the two lifts directly go to the eighth floor from the first floor, forcing students to take the steps from the first floor or to get down from the eight floor.“Does it make any sense to travel all the way eight floors and then get down to the fifth floor. We have also requested to implement the plans in a better way, but all the new rules or changes are making our lives miserable every day,” added another student.However, when the management of REVA university was asked about the row, they denied the students’ allegations by saying that the lift is catering to all the floors.“It is impossible to overload the lifts. If we overload them, the doors will not close. We have a time frame to use the lifts to make the students attend the assembly session before the class commences. Lots of students tend to miss it, so we have set a time limit to take the lift. “If students still have a problem they can always approach the management and we will look into the issue. We don’t compromise when it comes to students’ safety,” said Dr Ramesh, Dean, REVA University to DH.	lift,Reva University,students,	 Oct 12 2018
1,000 thambis of Madras Sappers clean Halasuru Lake	the Halasuru Lake in the heart of Bengaluru was no less than a battlefield on Wednesday morning.Entering the choppy waters barehanded, hundreds of Sappers from the Madras Engineering Group (MEG) of the Indian Army cleaned the water body on a war footing. Unable to withstand a beautiful lake dying right in front of their eyes, more than hundred Sappers (thambis) slogged for over eight hours since the dawn and cleansed the lake.By afternoon their collective effort resulted in the removal of more than a whopping 100 tonnes of water hyacinth, toxic weed and garbage.The Sappers had cleaned the lake in April-May this year and pulled out about 70 tonnes of weeds and garbage. However, this time the quantity of weeds and garbage has increased considerably. Sources at MEG revealed that the weeds and pollutants had flowed into the lake from the BBMP sediment tank.“Over the years, the lakes of Bangalore have deteriorated due to increasing sewage being drained into the lakes by the surging population. Moreover, the water hyacinth also keeps flowing into the lakes and choking their breathing life.“Ulsoor lake however has survived this calamity for the past several decades due to the incessant efforts put in by the Sappers of Madras Engineers Group and Centre. To tide over these problems, MEG has been repeatedly undertaking cleanliness drives in the lake regularly,” an official release from the Defence ministry stated.Halasuru Lake, located in the heart of Bengaluru, is a part of the daily life of Madras Sappers and is used daily for training purposes.

Residents strive to breathe life into Nallurahalli Lake	"once a favourite spot for migratory birds, has turned into a dumping yard for IT parks and residences in the area. All this, thanks to the BBMP's apathy.Garbage abounds the banks of the 24-acre lake, and the stormwater drain leading to the waterbody is choked with plastic.Apart from being encroached by private firms at a few places, the lake has turned into a dumping yard of vegetable and meat waste from several restaurants, IT parks and residential areas in the locality.Regular walkers across the lake complain about the foul smell emanating from the garbage mounds. ""I can spot worms feeding on the garbage and see dogs feasting on the rotten meat every day. Forget the smell, but we can’t bear the mosquito menace,"" said Vimal S, a resident in the vicinity. De-weeding of the lake was done by the residents, including apartment dwellers and village folks, two years ago. They had even planted over 300 saplings along the bund.""Two years ago, hardly any garbage was dumped here. But the intensity (of garbage dumping) has increased over the months. No civic body is heading this way. The residents and restaurants here fear no one. They will continue to dump waste until someone restricts them,"" Vimal added. Many corporate professionals are trying to clean parts of the lake as a part of their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) activities.""Last week, we visited the lake and planted some saplings, and cleared a bit of the dry plastic in the area. But how long can volunteers undertake the cleaning? We need the support of the BBMP,"" said Krishna Kumar, a corporate professional and resident of Nallurahalli.'Lake with BDA'Swapna N K, environmental engineer, BBMP, said: ""The lake still comes under the Bangalore Development Authority. We have sent a proposal to the government to get 58 lakes under our custody. We will begin the development work at the Nallurahalli Lake once it is handed over to us."""	stormwater drain,Nallurahalli Lake,Whitefield ,BBMP,	 Oct 10 2018
Poor network throws a spanner in BNU's digital push	colleges are unhappy with the varsity’s demand to upload their details online. As most of the affiliated colleges are situated in rural areas, they are plagued with poor internet connectivity and a shortage of computers in the colleges. “This should be done by the colleges and the university. Instead, they are putting the burden on us. They are aware that rural students lack such facilities, yet they are insisting that we do it for ourselves. The internet connectivity is very poor and it takes at least half an hour to upload the details,” said a student of a college affiliated to BNU. The students are a worried lot because the last date to upload the details is October 10. They are forced to visit cybercafes in nearby towns, not only missing their classes but also paying a hefty sum. “The owners demand Rs 150–200 to upload each student’s details. It has become a huge burden for students from economically weak sections. Even colleges have a scarcity of computer systems and internet,” the student added.Dr T D Kemparaju, vice-chancellor, BNU, told DH, “This move was intended to have all the stakeholders collectively participate. There were instances, where the student would notice an error in the marks card after receiving it. Then he/she would have to run pillar to post to get it corrected. With the new process, the student can enter his/her accurate details and also get the acknowledgement for the same. It is easier to spot where things go wrong.” In the latest process, the students’ details will go through three levels. The first level is with the students, the second with the college and the third at the university. When asked about the time constraints, the VC said, “We are more likely to extend the deadline. Since this is for the benefit of the students we will take a decision accordingly.”	BNU,students,	 Oct 10 2018
Dug-up roads not repaired, Whitefield residents suffer	nightmare for commuters as it has not yet been repaired after being dug up for laying pipelines for Cauvery water supply in Hagadur ward.Nagondanahalli Road is the only access for heavy vehicles coming from Kadugodi and Hoskote to reach Sarjapur Road, as they are banned from passing through Varthur bridge. But the condition of the road is pathetic as it is yet to be relaid after being dug up a few months ago to lay pipelines for Cauvery water connection.“I drive through this route every day to my office in Whitefield. After the short spells of rains over the last few weeks, the road is nothing but a cesspool, with many potholes. It is also strewn with garbage here and there. The BBMP is delaying restoration work,” said Navya Murthy, a resident of Nagondanahalli.Corporator, S Uday Kumar said that it will take some time to restore the road as Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is laying out sewage pipelines on the road. “The BBMP had dug up the road to lay pipelines for Cauvery water connection a few months ago after which we had started to restore the road. But due to rains, we stopped the work. Now that BWSSB is doing the work, it will take a few more months to restore the road.”Similar situation The residents of Thubarahalli have been striving hard to get the attention of BBMP to fix the two-km stretch of Thubarahalli village road for a decade now. Despite several complaints to the BBMP, the road has no street lights, footpaths and drains. The first protest was staged in 2013 by the residents after which the Palike had promised to fix the damaged road in five years. But nothing has changed so far. “The road leads to the biggest IT corridors in Whitefield limits. There are plenty of schools in and around Thubarahalli. The condition of the road is deteriorating day by day due to rains,” said Bhaskar Rao, resident.However, BBMP officials said that road widening and restoration should have started by now but is delayed due to lack of funds.

Have BMTC officials taken bribe, wonders minister	"he suggested that BMTC officials may have received bribes because ""they are mounting pressure to purchase electric buses by signing an agreement with a company."" The previous government had floated tenders for the purchase of 80 electric buses for Bengaluru. ""A Hyderabad company had applied. This company has manufactured 80 buses. Now, officials are exerting pressure to buy these buses. Can you imagine asking officials if they've taken a bribe,"" he said while speaking to reporters. To sign an agreement with the company would mean losses for the government, Thammanna said. ""We'll have to provide manpower to the company. We will also have to hand over the Shanthinagar bus depot to the Hyderabad company. So, we will not enter into an agreement with the company,"" he clarified. ""The government is thinking of operating electric buses on its own."" He added that no final decision had been taken on hiking bus fares. ""The proposal to hike fares by 18% is with the chief minister. Only he can take a final call,"" Thammanna said."	BMTC bus,Bengaluru,Thammanna,	 Oct 09 2018
Online plea against commercial buildings in Bellandur	"Bellandur have started an online petition seeking a reduction of congestion and commercial construction in Bellandur.The petition addressed to Mahendra Jain, additional chief secretary to the state government, is garnering support on change.org. The petition states that about 2.5 lakh residents of Bellandur along with employees, work in offices in and around Bellandur.The petition states that the commute time and quality of life have become unbearable due to the increase in vehicles and air pollution in and around Bellandur. The petition also states that the 78-acre RMZ Ecoworld, a tech park, houses 75,000 people in 23 office towers and also comprises 50 retail and dining outlets which have added significantly to the traffic mess on the road that connects Bellandur's residential community to the city via the outer ring road.The petition adds that the single arterial 40-feet-wide road cannot take the current load of vehicular traffic each day. It adds that this intersection that feeds into the EcoSpace junction on the ORR, has become notorious for nightmarish traffic congestion that blocks the entire ORR for miles.The petition also highlights that the additional 22-acre plot beside the residential community will soon have commercial set-ups after being taken over by RMZ. This additional planned commercial construction will add to the traffic woes. The petition adds that residents are already suffering from the adverse effects of air pollution caused by heavy traffic with many residents and children needing special medication and breathing aids.The residents, through the petition, have requested authorities to put a stop to this ""monstrous mess"" and stop these current projects and repurpose the use of this land in a planned and sustainable manner. They have also requested the additional joint secretary to hold meetings with RWAs and implement existing laws on congestion, carrying capacity and the need to cap new construction in areas where traffic is slow."

Breeze through KIA with Smart Security Lane	"breeze through a Smart Security Lane with Automated Tray Retrieval System (ATRS), dramatically reducing wait time at the security checkpoints. Once this is introduced, men and women will no longer need to be security-screened at different locations, a first in India. The KIA's operator, Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), has struck a deal with L3 Macdonald Humfrey (Automation) India Pvt Ltd, a UK-headquartered tech developer, to introduce the smart system. This agreement comes after a successful trial run in early 2017. The first phase will begin by the year-end, and the entire system will be in place by March 2019. The BIAL's decision to do away with gender-based segregation means families can stay together and will be screened together. ""This new system will accelerate the process of human and carry-on luggage screening faster than the regular methods, thereby reducing waiting time and congestion, offering an easy and efficient travel experience for passengers,"" the BIAL said in a release.The other benefits listed by the BIAL are reduced queuing and stress, accelerated passenger throughput, a significant reduction in manual intervention and cutting down of major capital and operational costs. Once fully operational, the passenger screening capacity will increase by over 50%. ""The smart lanes with ATRS will automatically return empty trays to the preparation area for passengers to place their bags and belongings, ending the hassle of looking for trays and also prevent empty trays from piling up."" Besides, the automated rollers will enable trays to automatically move into the screening machine, without the need for passengers or staff to push their trays/ bags into the X-Ray machines. ""We can now process more passengers in a secure and controlled environment, improving overall operational efficiency and enhancing safety and security,"" said the BIAL's Chief Operating Officer, Javed Malik. The first automated lanes will be installed in the domestic and international checkpoints by the end of 2018. ""The existing manual lanes will be replaced in a phased manner to ensure minimal disruption to airport operations. The project is due for completion by March 2019."" Mick Macdonald, president, Macdonald Humfrey (Automation) Ltd, said: ""Having installed similar solutions in many European, West Asian, North American and SEA airports, L3 Macdonald Humfrey has the expertise to implement this project at the Bengaluru airport."" How does it work? • Security screening officers will sit inside a secure central control room, fitted with a central screening system (Mach-Smart View Matrix System). • They will remotely process the images from the Smart Security Lanes.• Smart Lanes have 4/5 parallel divest stations where multiple passengers can get ready to be screened simultaneously.• All trays can carry the maximum-allowed cabin-size baggage. Trays are RFID-tagged and tracked from start to end. • Once passengers enter through the lanes, the trays will branch out into two lanes: One for security-cleared trays, easily accessed by passengers for a quick repack of their belongings. • The second lane is for trays with 'rejected' baggage that has an item that the security staff will query about. • Photo image and X-ray images of the tray are analysed. Possible threat items are marked on the touch screen by a screener in a remote screening room. The same images are available to the physical search officer to easily identify and remove items if required."	Kempegowda International Airport,Bengaluru,Airport,	 Oct 08 2018
Savior app to provide medical emergency needs	set to be launched in the city shortly. With just one click, the unique app alerts hospital ambulances, seeks help from trained first responders and informs the emergency contact registered in the app.Dikshith Rai, Founder and CEO of “Savior”, said the app will inform trained volunteers who can save a life within the golden hour.“About 460 people have been trained for the basic first aid required in case of an emergency. Ever since the app was launched in June this year, three lives have been saved under 10 minutes in Mangaluru with two people suffering a cardiac arrest and one meeting with an accident. He said that the ambulance response has improved by 85% in most part of Mangaluru,” he said. The volunteers are trained for basic life support, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), emergency accident care which includes stabilising an accident victim, stemming blood flow, splitting technics and proper transportation of the trauma victims. Volunteers are also trained for cases of choking, burns, scars, bites, stings etc.You can download the app and request to be a volunteer using the menu option.Once we train these people, we activate the volunteer mode. First responders (Volunteers) will only receive these emergency notifications when you keep the volunteer mode on.	Savior app,ambulance,	 Oct 08 2018
BBMP plans to shrink Gottigere Lake for road widening	spaces, government agencies have decided to cut a part of the Gottigere Lake on Bannerghatta Road for the Namma Metro project.At a recent meeting held by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Paike (BBMP) and the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), it was decided to widen the Bannerghatta Road by 10-15 feet. The road runs on the boundary of the 37.13-acre Gottigere Lake, which will pay the price for the development project.T Jagannath Rao, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Lakes, BBMP, told DH that at the meeting, it was decided to widen the Bannerghatta Road, including the Gottigere side, and give way for Metro Rail. A part of the lake will be lost in the process.Rao said there are no plans for any bridge. A concrete wall will be constructed on the dried-up portion of the lake. That portion will be made viable for road works.Another official, seeking anonymity, said it was easier to shrink lakes after the abolition of the Karnataka Lake Conservation of Develoment Authority (KLCDA) as the KLCDA Act is also lost. The lake can be saved only if the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) intervene.Interestingly, the Lokayukta had held a meeting with the BBMP officials to discuss issues pertaining to lakes on Friday. The Gottigere Lake issue was also discussed and the Lakayukta’s response was negative.During the visit of Upalokayukta Justice S B Majage in March 2015, directions were issued to fence and protect the lake.Locals and experts are not convinced with the idea of shrinking the lake. “A part of the lake has already been lost for toll road, layout and commercial establishments. The lake was once home to migratory birds and needs to be restored. With new projects, more area will be lost,” said Harsha, a resident.Prof T V Ramachandra, Energy and Wetlands Research Group, IISc, said the lake was being destroyed. He pointed out that according to the Wetlands Act 2015 and Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules 2016, the physical and chemical integrity of lakes cannot be altered. The size of the lake cannot be reduced, roads and bridges cannot be built over them, he noted.In 1999, environmentalist Suresh Heblikar had filed a petition in the Karnataka High Court against the BDA’s (the then custodian) move to construct a road through the lake. The court ordered that no road be laid on the lake and that water body should be maintained.Heblikar said the lake has lost its original identity. Now, if it is shrunk further, there nothing much would be left.	Namma Metro,Gottigere Lake,Bengaluru,BBMP,	 Oct 08 2018
Plan to unclog Majestic fails;  KSRTC buses back	buses to Peenya to decongest Majestic has turned out to be a sham with illegal operations by private buses forcing them back. Following a meeting between the heads of different departments last year, it was decided to utilise the Basaveshwara Bus Station in Peenya to decongest the Kempegowda Bus Station at Majestic. On April 12, the KSRTC shifted 60 buses bound for almost all the districts situated in the north of Bengaluru. “The shifting of 60 buses has caused operational loss of Rs 3 lakh per day as most of our passengers shifted to private buses. The losses almost doubled during the weekends and holiday periods,” a senior KSRTC official said. The services were restarted from Majestic on September 10. In the five months, the corporation is estimated to have suffered a loss of about Rs 6 crore. A senior official said they had advised against moving to Peenya until the government bans private buses from operating near Majestic. Operating buses from the satellite bus station in Peenya had proved to be suicidal for the KSRTC back in 2014 as well when the shifting of about 650 buses had led to losses to the tune of Rs 12 crore within two months. The Peenya bus station is situated 850 metres away from the main road while private buses would pick up passengers from Tumakuru Road. This time, despite pressure from the government, the KSRTC was cautious and shifted only 60 buses.“Senior officials in the government assumed that people would eventually start to board buses from Peenya. Even the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) tried to help by introducing 115 trips to the bus station every day. But nothing changed,” another official said. Initially, the KSRTC had claimed that the move to Peenya had helped them save fuel and time. “What is the use of saving fuel when all our passengers are boarding private buses?” the official said. Officials said they would write to the government to ensure restriction on the operation of private buses. “There is no point talking about decongestion if they don’t restrict private players,” the official said.

BDA writes to BBMP to control flooding in Bellandur	Bellandur, Varthur and Yamalur lakes, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) has now passed the buck on to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).In a letter to BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, BDA commissioner Rakesh Singh has pointed to the delay in commissioning the flood protection works at the three lakes.In the letter, Singh has warned BBMP of the beating they could receive from the NGT during the next hearings. “It would be relevant to bring to your notice the undesirable further impact of non-completion of works by BBMP if the rains continue further. We may end up receiving a notice from the NGT in this regard and BDA will find it difficult to defend the case and hence the request to complete the BBMP works on a war footing,” Singh said in the letter, a copy of which is with DH.BDA has stated that while the authority has complied with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines of controlling floods by creating sluice gates, BBMP is carrying out flood protection works by remodelling the valleys at Bellandur and Yamalur. The inordinate delay in commissioning the works has affected the lake, thus leading to frothing.Singh in the letter also said that while BDA has completed the construction of the sluice gate at Bellandur and is completing it at Yamalur, delay in executing the works by BBMP has led to blocking the flood water at Yamalur weir. This delay has led to the diversion of flood water to Bellalndur weir, which is causing the problem.Singh requested BBMP to complete the works without any further delay and temporary barriers constructed across Yamalur be removed immediately.Reacting to this, BBMP chief engineer Prahallad said that works are going on at Kalkere and Bellandur and will be completed soon. It was only recently that the BDA handed over the lake work to BBMP and they (BDA) cannot expect the works to be completed in a short span when the custodians have been unable to maintain the lake for so many years.

They will be deputed shortly.Vikram Narayan, member of Indiranagar residents’ welfare association Illegal commercial establishments, including software companies, are coming up in residential areas in Indiranagar, causing huge concerns for local residents. Will the BBMP take any action against them? Deputy Chief MinisterI have seen many offices coming up in Indiranagar. It is probably because no one has complained and the officials concerned have not looked into the issue. We will look into it shortly. Dr Asha Benakappa, retired HoD, Vani Vilas HospitalThere is a new generation super-absorbent pampers used by infants, and on an average, each child is generating at least 15 kg to 20 kg garbage per month. How are we going to address this issue?Wilma RodriguesThis is one issue that needs to be addressed, and needs a permanent solution. Chandrashekhar, RWA member Just like how the BBMP constructed Indira Canteens in each ward, why can’t you come up with segregation and compost plants in each of the 198 wards?BBMP commissionerWe can come up with composting plants, but the citizens themselves oppose such plants. Why can’t members of the residents’ welfare associations decide on the place where they want the plant? The BBMP is ready to install these plants. Ravi Gangigati, a resident of NagarabhaviIs it not possible for the police on night patrol duty to fine those who are throwing garbage on the streets?Deputy Chief MinisterAt the moment, there is a fine of Rs 100, which can be increased to Rs 500 and up to Rs 5,000. But again, I may receive complaints about even the fine amount being demanded or misused. We will come up with a solution for this problem. Vani Murthy, member of Solid Waste Management Round TableWe need to come up with a model to provide rebate on property tax for those who do home composting and reduce waste at least by 60%. We do not need 24-hour composting machines.BBMP commissionerThere is a proposal to provide 50% rebate and it has to be discussed before the council and approved. Anuradha Govind, Whitefield RisingOur apartment is located in a ward that has large areas and requires numerous health inspectors. Also, what does the BBMP have to say about the area having over 400 PGs and only 26 being on record?

K Prakash, member of Begur residents’ welfare associationOur areas come under the newly added 110 villages, a semi urban area which is largely neglected by the BBMP. The waste is not collected and roads are not laid. When will you address our issues?BBMP commissionerAfter 2007, 110 villages were added to the BBMP, increasing the area, and at the moment, the BWSSB is laying water and underground drainage pipeline. Once their work is completed, the BBMP will look into the roads and civic issues. Nagendar, resident of Bluejay Sunshine Hills, Karihobana halli, DoddabidirukalluA garbage processing unit is coming up in our locality within 50 meters of our residential layout. The plant will cause serious health concerns to the residents, especially children.BBMP commissionerThere are seven composting units functioning at the moment and there is no question about the BBMP closing down any of the plants. Guruprasad, member of Sobha Dream Acres residents’ welfare association A landfill near our flat is a serious health hazard for 3,000 families living in these apartment blocks. The waste from a piggery is dumped and burned near the compound of our apartment. Please address the issue.

'People in BMWs litter, how can we clean city?'	"Bengaluru's glory unless people take waste management seriously, Deputy Chief Minister Parameshwara said on Saturday. According to him, only a change in people's mindset can lead to visible improvements on the ground. ""Residents of RMV Extension in Sadashivanagar, where I stay, are supposed to be cultured. But very few of them segregate garbage. I have seen many people coming in BMW (cars) and throwing garbage on the roadside,"" he said, adding that such a mindset will defeat all government efforts. Parameshwara, who is also Bengaluru Development Minister, was speaking at 'Cleaning up Bengaluru: Garbage Collection and Disposal', a panel discussion organised by DH. He said the poor with no access to basic amenities cannot be expected to adopt sustainable practices when people having all the facilities do not follow simple rules. ""There are people living in pathetic conditions on the periphery of the city and we are spending crores of rupees to solve issues like garbage in developed areas,"" he said. The deputy chief minister also took questions from citizens and representatives of resident welfare associations.'Raise littering fine'When Ravi G, a resident of Nagarabhavi, sought an amendment in the law to increase the fine for littering, Parameshwara agreed that the step would act as a deterrent but also sounded a note of caution. ""We can't force people to pay a fine of Rs 5,000. First, awareness needs to be created among the public. Punishment can follow later,"" he said."	Parameshwara,Bengaluru,	 Oct 07 2018
CM: Work on ring road, elevated stretch soon	"elevated roads in Bengaluru at the earliest to address the traffic problems and the foundation stone for these two mega projects will be laid next month, Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy said on Saturday.""The government is serious about addressing the traffic problems, vehicular pollution and improving infrastructure in Bengaluru. In the first phase, the government will build ring roads and elevated roads at the earliest,"" the chief minister said while participating in a media event.Though there is opposition from some sections of the society to elevated roads, the government will address their concerns, the chief minister said.He said the first phase of the metro rail is already completed and work on the second phase is in progress and the government will approve the third phase soon.Petrol under GSTThe chief minister also said he was against bringing petroleum products under GST. With the implementation of GST, the states will be left with only three sources of revenue — fuel, excise and stamp duty imposed on land registration.Keeping the state's revenues in mind, bringing fuel prices under GST was not practical, he said.The chief minister also said the coalition government is stable and will complete its full five-year term without any hitch.

Doing everything to fix potholes: BWSSB to court	Court its first status report with regard to action taken on addressing the pothole issue in the city.A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari was hearing a public interest litigation on the menace of potholes.The report says the BWSSB is extending support to the BBMP. It says that whenever manholes were to be raised to the road level, it did so to ensure a smooth surface. The spots which required wet mixing with full compaction have been completed and the surfaces levelled. The report says that a consumer who intends to have connections to his house shall take permission for road-cutting from the BBMP, following which the BWSSB will process the sanction for connection. The BBMP will asphalt the road thereafter.	potholes,BWSSB,Karnataka High Court,	 Oct 06 2018
Metro skips deadline, to reach Anjanapura next year	the work on Mysuru-Road Kengeri is expected to be completed only in 2020, a year later than the deadline set by the previous government.With this, the previous government’s announcement of opening the Yelachenahalli-Anjanapura line (6.29 km) by December 2018 and Mysore Road-Kengeri line (6.46) by mid-2020 has turned out to be a shallow promise.The then Bengaluru Development Minister K J George had announced about this during an inspection of metro work.Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) Managing Director Ajay Seth said civil work on the Anajanapura line would be completed only by April 2019.“We will be able to commission both the lines (Anjanapura and Kengeri) in 2020. I cannot give the precise month (for commissioning) at this juncture,” he said.Financial crisisThe financial crisis of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), the contractor for Mysore Road-Pattangere (3.95 km) stretch has reportedly hit the progress of work on the Kengeri line.“The contractor has finished 75% of the work, and we are looking into the issues. Work is going on, and the line will be commissioned in 2020,” he said.The BMRCL called tender for the Silk Board-KR Puram Metro line on Outer Ring Road (Phase 2A) in February. The deadline for submission of bids ended in May, following an extension of the last date for the bid submission.However, the financial bids are yet to be opened.Sources in BMRCL said IL&FS, a company since in financial crisis, has emerged the lowest bidder.Asked about the BMRCL’s decision on the bidder, the managing director said they were still evaluating the situation.“We have not yet awarded the tender for ORR Metro. There are issues, which are being closely evaluated. We would not like to take any knee-jerk decision,” he said.	BMRCL,Namma Metro,	 Oct 05 2018
KSRTC Majestic platforms to open	"in Majestic will not be a big inconvenience for passengers from Saturday, with officials reopening about 20 platforms that were closed eight years ago.The additional platforms will come up on the other side of Terminal 2, which was handed over to the BMRCL for metro construction work. It has been recently recovered. However, officials of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) said there was no plan to introduce additional buses or new routes.""At present, all buses have to make do with Terminal 1 and 2. Passengers had to huddle on crowded platforms and we had a tough time making space for parking of buses. We hope the additional platforms will reduce the congestion,"" an official said.Buses to Mangaluru, Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru, among other destinations, that were till now departing from Terminal 1 and platforms 17 and 18 of Terminal 2 will be shifted to the new platforms facing the metro station.The official said they will think of additional buses based on the demand from the public. ""The matter of additional buses becomes relevant during weekends and festival days. We will take a decision then,"" he said."	KSRTC,	 Oct 05 2018

Bicycle sharing system may take off next week	and last mile connectivity? Then get ready to peddle as Namma Metro will soon offer free parking space for bicycles under public bicycle sharing (PBS) system, which is likely to be launched next week.Department of Urban Land Transport (Dult) special officer N Murali Krishna said two companies, Peddl and Yulu, have expressed readiness for a formal launch by October 10.“The government will decide on the launch date. Two players will deploy 1,000 bicycles in two clusters identified for the first phase,” he said.Dult has divided Bengaluru into eight clusters of 10 sq km each, and two clusters have been selected in the first phase. Cluster 1 includes a network of MG Road-Museum Road-Indiranagar-Ulsoor-Old Airport Road area network comes.Most of the HSR Layout-BTM Layout areas come under Cluster 2.Krishna said the department has identified and geo-tagged parking spaces in the two areas and similar work was being taken up in other parts of the city, which will get PBS in the next phases.“Three more companies have expressed interest, and their qualification will be decided in the next two weeks. The PBS can be extended to other areas once they come into play,” he added.Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has demarcated space for bicycles in 40 Metro stations. Those who hire PBS bicycles can park them for free in these spots, which will be suggested on the app of the respective service provider.“The parking space has been identified based on accessibility and convenience of passengers. By becoming part of PBS network, we will address some of the challenges in last-mile connectivity,” BMRCL Managing Director Ajay Seth said.Cycle tracks not readyWhile the PBS is envisioned to play a major role in the coming years by complimenting Metro, suburban rail and bus network, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has not been able to build the 130 km cycle track.According to officials so far, cycle track work has been completed in only small stretches of roads in the central business district and HSR Layout.“The idea of a complete cycle track is possible only if other agencies and private parties do not dig up the road. TenderSure project can deliver such roads,” a senior official said.However, a DULT official said mere cycle track network was not sufficient, but other vehicles on certain roads should also be restricted.“Changes in policy are needed to ban and restrict cars and motorbikes on some roads. Strict enforcement to ensure bikes do not enter cycle tracks is essential,” he said.	Yulu,Bicycle Sharing System,Peddl,	 Oct 04 2018
Cabinet to clear decks for suburban rail SPV	setting up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the implementation of suburban rail project as the Cabinet is expected to approve the restructuring of a company that will represent the state in SPV.The Railway Board had last year agreed to Karnataka’s proposal to constitute an SPV through the Karnataka Railway Infrastructure Development Corporation (K-RIDE), a company in which the government was a minority holder with 49% of shares.Sources in the government said the K-RIDE shares have been restructured and the government has become a major holder whereas private company I-DECK will hold 0.5% of the shares.“The government and the railways will decide whether K-RIDE will be part of SPV. Once the Cabinet approves new form of K-RIDE, a memorandum of understanding will be signed with the railways on the SPV,” the source said.It has also been proposed to increase the equity of K-RIDE from the present Rs 5 lakh to Rs 5 crore.“The higher equity will enable the company to borrow large loans while working on projects like suburban rail,” the source said.‘No need to wait for SPV’A senior official noted that the railways and the state government need not wait for the SPV to take up works.“The SPV will happen by the time the detailed project reports are prepared. K-RIDE can work with the railways on suburban rail-related projects even before,” he said.Since the state government and the railways have agreed for equal sharing of equity and borrowings, there should be no hindrance to take up works. Besides, the SPV will take over the expenditures and borrowings from K-RIDE.Works like doubling and electrification of the Byappanahalli-Hosur line, for which tender has already been called, and quadrupling of the Cantonment-Whitefield line can be expedited once the state government pitches in through K-RIDE, the official said.The Rs 12,000-crore suburban rail project sanctioned by the Union government envisages a 100km rail network, including doubling and quadrupling, for local trains. Announced in the 2017 budget, the project has been stuck due to delay in the formation of SPV.	Suburban railway,SPV,	 Oct 04 2018
BBMP gains pace in removing advertising structures	hoardings, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has stepped up the pace in removing the advertisement structures also.This comes close on the heels of the civic body successfully removing the illegal flexes and banners across the city.The BBMP also filed as many as 767 FIRs against offenders for not adhering to the guidelines set by the court. Though 97 of these offenders voluntarily removed the advertising structures after the filing of FIRs by the BBMP, the remaining are still pending.Meanwhile, after the state government’s approval for the BBMP to go ahead with the newly drafted advertising bylaws, the Palike has now called for objections from the public. Citizens can access the document, which is available both online and at the BBMP offices across the city.The draft is open for public view for a period of one month and the objections can be filed within this period. A senior BBMP official said that the revised draft of the new advertising bylaws would be submitted to the state government and rules will come into effect once it is gazetted.

Bescom to set up 11 EV charging stations	"Limited (Bescom) head office to charge their electric vehicles.Under the second phase of the project, from October, the energy department will start the process to set up 11 EV charging stations in the city. It has chosen 11 locations, from the list of 123 shortlisted for the EV stations.In the first phase of the project, it had set up charging points at its head office and at the Vidhana Soudha.The places have been selected based on traffic, residential and commercial spaces surrounding them. The stations will set up on the premises of Bescom where infrastructure is easily available.C Shikha, managing director, Bescom, told DH: “The 11 locations have been finalised, and tenders will be called in the next couple of days.""""We have set a target of a month to start the work. The stations will follow the set Bharat Standard norms for the electric vehicles,” she added.The demand for charging stations is increasing. Not just for cars, but also for two-wheelers, especially after the rise of renting bikes.Shikha said since there already have been delays, the locations have been chosen in such a way so that work can be completed at the earliest.To set up the stations, the Bescom has chosen the places which are close to 11 KV lines and have sufficient space for two DC and AC charging stations according to the Ministry of Power Guidelines — space for a car and a two-wheeler.In the coming days, the Bescom will look for spaces around BBMP head office, Metro rail parking lots, BMTC depots, bus terminals, BWSSB offices and other government offices.Charging station locations1- N4 Sub-division office, Peenya2- C6 Sub-division office, Mathikere3- C7 Sub-division office, Yelahanka4- E8 Sub-division office, Banaswadi5- Indiranagar division office, HAL 2nd Stage6- Mahadevapura O&M office7- S7 Sub-division office, Murugeshpalya, HAL8- HSR division office, HSR 2nd Sector9- BTM O&M Unit- 2, BTM Layout10- Kathriguppe O&M office11- BICC-2, DAS, near ESI, Rajajinagar"	Charging Stations,BESCOM,Electric Vehicles,	 Oct 03 2018
SC allows owners to contest land acquisition for layout	"the High Court of Karnataka, allowing a group of landowners from southern Bengaluru to oppose the proceedings initiated by Poornaprajna House Building Co-Operative Society Ltd before a trial court for removing them from a portion of 120 acres of land acquired by the state government for creating a residential colony. A bench of Justices R Banumathi and Indira Banerjee issued a notice to C Bhagya and others on a special leave petition filed by the housing co-op challenging the validity of the order passed by the high court on January 11. ""Issue notice. There shall be (a) stay of the proceedings until further orders from this court,"" the bench ordered on the petition argued by advocate Sanjay M Nuli. The housing co-op claimed the high court allowed the landowners to file documents and written statements before the trial court, condoning a delay of three-and-a-half years in contravention of the Civil Procedure Code which prescribed a limit of 120 days for the purpose. It further contended that the landowners had entered an appearance in the trial court in 2012 but chose not to file any written statement. The housing co-op had filed a suit before the trial court for the declaration of the title and demolition of illegal constructions over three acres and 11 guntas of land in Uttarahalli hobli, Bengaluru South taluk. The high court, in its order, however, noted there were 79 landowners and some of them entered into a compromise with the housing co-op. It would be a grave injustice if other landowners were not allowed to contest their case. The high court also noted that the time limit put under the CrPC was not mandatory but only directory and thus it did not put an embargo on the power of the court to extend the time. It imposed Rs 24,000 as a cost on the writ petitioners but directed it to be paid by the Legal Services Authority."	Poornaprajna House Building Co-Operative Society Ltd,	 Oct 02 2018
Doubling of Baiyappanhalli-Hosur line to start soon	"has invited bids for civil work on the doubling of the Baiyappanahalli-Hosur line, months after the Centre approved the Rs 376-crore project. The doubling will help introduce more trains to IT corridor in the southern parts of Bengaluru. The civil work on the 48-km stretch has been divided into five packages, each varying in distances between 7 km and 11 km. The South Western Railway has set an October 23 deadline for submission of the bids. Once the tender is awarded, the contractor will get 18 months to complete the project, which includes earthwork in cutting, embankment and construction of major and minor bridges as well as railway under bridges. With this, work on doubling is likely to begin in the next two months. Once the land is prepared, the railways will call tenders for laying track and electrification works. This should be following by automatic block signalling and intermediate block signalling works, which are an integral part of the suburban rail network.Urban transport activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar said the railways should take up work on additional stations in the same breath. ""Stations should be built every two to three kilometres or even less. The railways should also eliminate all the level crossings near Kaggadasapura, Hellalige and Anekal Road and other places along the route at the same time,"" he said.Previously, activists have submitted a demand for building 10 additional stations along the Yashwantpur-Hosur route. Of them, Doddanekkundi, Munnekolala, Huskur Road, Chandapur and KHB Layout Suryanagar are located between Baiyappanahalli and Hosur.Noting that the state government has agreed to share 50% of the project cost, Dyamannavar said the railways should take up a comprehensive project at once to bring relief to commuters."	suburban rail network,	 Oct 02 2018
Segregating garbage at source turning futile: Residents	was a daily fight with the civic workers as the latter was collecting garbage from all neighbouring houses, except hers.After frequent fights, Apeksha had no choice but to segregate waste at source.“I have now understood how much of effort it requires to segregate the waste. But it pains to know that all the effort goes waste,” said Apeksha.In February 2017, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) made it mandatory to separate the waste at source. By April, there were reports of the city achieving up to 50% of segregation at source. However, due to lack of will in enforcing stricter laws and regulations, the percentage has been steadily declining, said solid waste management experts.“As of now, the city is segregating about 40% of garbage,” said N S Ramakant, a solid waste management expert.While most citizens do not even know that the BBMP has made it mandatory to segregate waste, some claim that there was no use in doing it as everything gets mixed in the end.“I have been segregating waste, but the dry waste collection does not happen here. And finally, the sanitation workers mix both,” said Smruthi Zacharia, a resident of Jayanagar 5th Block.“There is an absolute lack of political will to enforce stringent rules. A couple of other reasons, such as missing auto tippers and compactors, and lack of enforcing micro plan rules also add to the problem,” said Ramakant.“The civic body can learn lessons from Muzzafurpur in Bihar. They introduced segregation at source a year ago. Out of 35 wards, 90% of them have achieved it already,” he said.BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, however, believes that the entire process can be successful only if citizens participate.“In this huge city, where about 4,500 metric tonnes of garbage is generated daily, it is humanly impossible to sort this issue without the help of residents. Most of them do not segregate garbage, and even if some do, it is unfortunate that some sanitation workers mix it or all get mixed up in the end. Creating more awareness and informing about the benefits of the initiative has to be done more,” said Prasad.	waste segregation,Solid Waste Management,	 Oct 02 2018
Designer leaf composters to treat Bengaluru's waste	stop tonnes of leaf waste heading straight to the landfills, and instead use them to produce compost to green Bengaluru. Initiated by the social startup Daily Dump, a collective design intervention is now underway to fabricate a unique leaf composter that is cheap, aesthetic, functional and commercially viable.Showcased at the ongoing Bangalore Design Week, the designs stand out for their visual appeal. But their functionality would be tested once the drawing board designs morph into prototypes. Mass production will then be explored through a tripartite tie-up that includes Daily Dump, the design studio and corporate partners.So, what thinking went into the designs, one of which might just give Bengaluru a green makeover?Chinmay Dholakia from Ether Designs explains: “We have gone into a different scale of manufacturing that saves cost, offers beautiful possibilities of shape and form, keeps cost low, reduces parts and joinery; a single monolithic shape of sorts.”The idea was to stick to a design that scores high on adaptability.“Our approach was oriented for mass production. Look at how the Sintex tank and a particular form of a plastic chair has become hugely popular due to their adaptability. Our concept was to use recycled engineering plastics, roto moulding and make the composter sturdy,” says Dholakia. Simplicity is at the core of the composter’s design.“Sweep the leaves off parks and streets and dump them into the cylindrical composter. Water it regularly for the first month or so, and take out the compost through an outlet at the bottom after four to six months.” The more the leaves are composted, the better the end product. “Compost could be sold for Rs 4 a kg if it is four months old. You can charge Rs 8 a kilo if it is six to seven months old.”An alternative concept, the 'Flexa Compostor' proposes using a simple plastic tarpaulin stitched into a sack. “The material is easily available, can be reused, is weather-proof and rugged. The sack has plastic rivets which creates adequate air movement within. Similar orifices at the container bottom allow water to drain out when needed,” Flexa’s designers explain.

Metro's 2nd six-car train to run from Thursday	"Thursday. A bridge that links the Kempegowda (Majestic) metro station to the BMTC bus station will also be inaugurated that day. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) Managing Director Ajay Seth confirmed to DH that Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy will flag off the second six-car train on Thursday.A source said the bridge in Majestic, which was ready over three months ago, will be inaugurated the same day. ""The chief minister is also expected to ride the metro until Nagasandra from where he is scheduled to take part in an event at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre,"" the source said.The BMRCL received three intermediate cars on September 6. Work on the formation of the six-car train was done at the Peenya depot. The big train would be introduced on the Purple Line (Baiyappanahalli-Mysore Road), which still sees a heavy rush. Metro's daily ridership climbed high after the introduction of the first six-car train with numbers touching 4.3 lakhs on August 20. Officials expect that the addition of two more six-car trains will help reach the target of five lakh riders per day."	Six-coach train,BMRCL,Namma Metro,	 Oct 02 2018
L&T said to win contract to build KIA's 2nd terminal	has reportedly clinched the deal to build the first phase of the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA)'s second terminal. Airport sources confirmed the deal but indicated that the company will be coming out with the details soon. L&T had built the airport's first runway and also bagged the contract to construct the KIA's second runway. The first phase of the airport's second terminal is scheduled to be completed by March 2021. Once this phase is operationalised, the airport's combined capacity is expected to exceed 45 Million Passengers Per Annum (MPPA). The airport had crossed the 25 MPPA mark in 2017. Besides L&T, three Indian companies and a Turkish firm were in competition for the contract. Sources said the total cost of the first phase was pegged at Rs 3,000 crore, although this could not be immediately verified. Since its commercial launch in 2008, the Bengaluru airport has emerged as India's third busiest, after Mumbai and Delhi. In April, the KIA operator, Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), had announced that it served 26.91 MPPA in the financial year 2017-18. A total of 44 airlines link the KIA to 46 domestic and 21 international destinations. The Airports Regulatory Authority of India (AERA) had directed the BIAL to complete the second terminal's first phase by March 2021. It had also warned that a penalty would be levied if the deadline is exceeded. Aviation experts had noted that the deadline could be challenging since the new terminal would have to be seamlessly integrated with the second runway, and all landing/take-off trials should be completed before commissioning T2.

Now, cobblestones to adorn Jayanagar and Hudson Circle	engineers, of late. After laying cobblestones on the Church Street and Anand Rao Circle junction, the BBMP is now using the same at Shivarathreeshwara circle in Jayanagar 7th Block.This five-legged junction is particularly chosen as it involves the movement of a lot of vehicles, and connects some important places such as Kanakapura Road, Banashankari 2nd Stage, Jayanagar 8th Block, Yediyur and Jayanagar 4th Block, said KT Nagaraj, chief engineer, road infrastructure (projects), BBMP.“Laying cobblestones will help in smooth movement of traffic and pedestrians. This project also aims to increase the aesthetics of the junction,” said Praveen Lingaiah, traffic engineering cell, BBMP.Residents apprehensiveOn the other hand, some residents and motorists have expressed their concern over the durability of the work.Akshay Naidu from Jayanagar 5th block said: “We have read reports of how cobblestones are coming out or loosening, just months after they were laid on the Church Street. The vehicle movement here is much higher. With the kind of work that the BBMP undertakes, it is important to know how long will this last.”The work is going on mostly during the night, causing less hindrance to traffic movement during the day, said Lingaiah.Similarly, another resident, Ramya K expressed her concern about waterlogging problems.“We all have heard about how the stagnant water causes problems to the white-topping. The question is whether they will maintain and resolve such issues,” she said.The cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 40 lakh and, the work is expected to be complete in another 15 days, said Lingaiah.The BBMP has taken a similar exercise at the Hudson Circle also.Another official from the civic body said the BBMP was planning to lay cobblestone from Jayanagar 4th Block (Cool Joint signal) to JP Nagar 24th Main for a stretch of 25 kilometres. The cost of the project would be Rs 25 crore.	Cobblestone,Jayanagar,Hudson Circle,	 Oct 01 2018
Rs 100 fine not enough to curb littering: Experts	"city and get away with a fine of just Rs 100, there will be no respite from the garbage menace, experts have said and called for a change in policy to solve the problem. In 2013, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) began levying a penalty in a bid to implement waste segregation and management in the city. As per the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (Amendment) Act, 1976, littering, spitting, urinating, open defecation and other acts of nuisance on the roads, bus stations, railway stations, playgrounds and other premises of public utility attract a fine of Rs 100 for the first time and Rs 200 for subsequent offences. For domestic occupiers, unsegregated waste attracts a penalty of Rs 100 for the first offence and Rs 500 for subsequent offences. Meanwhile, for bulk generators or commercial complexes, it is Rs 500 for the first offence and Rs 1,000 for subsequent offences. Sandhya Narayan, a member of the Solid Waste Management Round Table and SWM Expert Committee, said: ""The fine was fixed six years ago and needs to be increased. Also, not much is known about enforcement or how much fine the BBMP has collected for non-segregation of waste or for other offences related to waste management."" N Manjunath Prasad, Commissioner, BBMP, agreed that the penalty needs to be increased and that the civic body must enforce it rigorously. ""Most are not bothered about the penalty. They are ready to pay the fine and litter."" Construction waste and debris As if things weren't bad, the illegal dumping of construction debris is only adding to the garbage menace. The city generates around 3,600 tonnes of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste per day, making Bengaluru the fourth largest generator of construction debris in the country, as per a report by Vijinapura Eco Civic Team (VECT). Currently, the fine for dumping C&D waste is Rs 5,000. In 2017, the then Mayor R Sampath Raj had proposed to hike the fine to Rs 1 lakh."	Garbage crisis,BBMP,Littering,	 Oct 01 2018
BDA struggling to sell CA sites in Kempegowda Layout	"sites at Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout are getting returned, prompting the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) to renotify them.Though the BDA had notified 18 CA sites in the layout, it had responses for 10 of them. ""We've received applications for schools, hospitals and samudaya bhavans (community halls),"" a BDA official told DH, admitting that the response has been far below their expectations.Those applying for the CA sites had apparently told the BDA that they will develop them in the long run, meaning they will probably violate BDA rules to develop the sites immediately and would rather wait for infrastructure to be ready.In fact, many have withdrawn their applications to buy the sites due to lack of facilities and the considerable distance to the layout from the city. This has left the BDA anxious since this is the first time citizens are rejecting CA sites.Measuring between 0.5 and four acres, the CA sites do not include parks and playgrounds, which the BDA has planned to create on buffer zones basis.The authority’s rules stipulate that 10% of the layout should be reserved for the CA sites. In Kempegowda Layout, the land reserved for the CA site is less.In the first and second phase, the BDA had formed 5,000 sites each. ""The CA sites have been carved out based on the availability of space in the layout with the BDA. The engineering wing had identified 22 CA sites, but only 18 were notified for people and four are reserved for the government agencies,"" the official said.The Kempegowda Layout is sprawled over 4043.27 acres, of which 2383.11 acres is with the BDA and is litigation-free. In this land, the BDA marked out 17,900 sites and 18 CA sites.It held the last meeting on CA sites on September 25, but the final list of allottees was not decided. BDA sources said the final list of CA allottees will be decided by Deputy Chief Minister and Bengaluru Development Minister G Parameshwara instead of the BDA board.""After he finalises the list, a resolution will be passed and signed by the BDA secretary. The list will then be made public,"" a BDA source said."	BDA,Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout,	 Oct 01 2018
BBMP looks to sky to shore up property tax collection	"at the sky, literally, to shore up its flagging property tax collection. Starting next year, the civic body will use satellite imagery to map property data with the help of Bhuvan, the Indian Space Research Organisation's software application that allows users to explore a 2D/3D representation of the surface of the earth. The BBMP had signed up a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with ISRO in 2016 to provide the software application for improving its Geographical Information System (GIS) data. A source in the BBMP said: ""ISRO recently conducted training sessions for us. Satellite imagery will be captured for analysing property tax data."" An official working closely on the project said that the focus right now was on integrating the BBMP's property tax data with Bhuvan. ""The applications of the technology and data into the specific areas will be taken up in due course depending on the functional feasibility of technology with the nature of the data available,"" he added. ""The clear satellite imagery will help the BBMP check violations that property owners have done."" BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, however, dismissed a media report that the satellite imagery would be used to identify potholes and other civic problems. ""We, along with ISRO, are working on the technology to identify properties in the city. There is no way we'll use this technology to identify potholes and other civic issues. That's just a figment of someone's imagination,"" he told DH. Property tax is the BBMP's only major source of revenue but the civic body has been consistently failing in meeting the target. In the last fiscal year, it collected just Rs 1,665 crore, as against the target of Rs 2,600 crore from an estimated 16 lakh properties in the city."

'City to be rid of illegal hoardings in 2 weeks'	campaign to rid the city of illegal hoardings. The civic body has begun dismantling the hoarding structures which do not hold the advertisements or banners any longer. According to the BBMP Commissioner, N Manjunath Prasad, they have removed at least 100 gantries so far and the remaining 500 are expected to be dismantled in the next two weeks in all the eight BBMP zones.On August 14, the BBMP had issued a public notice asking the concerned agencies to bring down the metal structures which hold the hoardings by August 30. Failing which the civic body would dismantle them and recover the cost from the owners and agencies of the hoarding. The civic body then pushed the deadline to September 6 and warned the agencies of legal action. The BBMP had filed 759 FIRs against the hoardings' owners who didn't remove them within the stipulated deadline. The civic body had served 1,848 final notices.

In October that year, the state Assembly formed an 11-member House Committee headed by former Speaker KB Koliwad. The panel was to look into encroachment of lakes in and around Bengaluru. Storm water drain encroachments also came under the committee’s purview.Prior to the formation of the committee, a special drive to remove encroachments of tank beds in Bengaluru was abruptly halted. There was public outrage over demolition of houses near the Puttenahalli lake because it was the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) that had permitted them to be built. The BDA later admitted, shockingly, that it had formed 23 layouts on tank beds.The House committee came as a blessing in disguise for the state government and erring officials. It was decided to halt demolition of encroached properties on BDA layouts until the House committee came out with its report.Thus began the saga of officials and builders taking shelter under the Koliwad committee, which took three full years to come out with its final report that experts say was not only vague but also fraught with contradictions.The committee’s report stated that 501.11 acres of the network had been encroached by 2,083 encroachers. Authorities began passing the buck on clearing encroachments while the committee dragged its feet.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which was dependent on surveyors to identify and mark drain encroachment, pointed fingers at the Revenue Department, which in turn looked towards the House committee for its final report. In November 2017, the committee tabled its final report before the Legislative Assembly. It suggested a way out: diversion of drains wherever possible. “The natural drains that carried rainwater along the slope to join another canal have been altered to benefit urban projects,” the committee noted. “It must be observed here that we must consider existing drains that are carrying out the function of the natural system that once existed. Otherwise, trying to restore the natural system would involve cancellation of projects and destruction of the location, which is not appropriate.”In other words, the committee, while acknowledging that drains had been diverted, legitimised it.In another recommendation, the committee asked the government to restore drains where the alternative canals had failed. “In such cases, the committee recommends indiscriminate removal of encroachments regardless of the person or building involved,” the report stated.“It is deplorable that the committee brought legalities into the illegalities,” said water expert V Ramprasad. “The valley contours of Bengaluru will not support diversion of drains, because water will invariably flow in the natural slope,” he pointed out.Around the same time the Koliwad committee submitted its report, the Environmental Management and Policy Research Institute (EMPRI) also finalised its draft report on Inventorisation of Water Bodies in Bengaluru Metropolitan Area. Contrary to the Koliwad committee, the EMPRI recommended eviction of drain encroachers.“The storm water drains are like veins, which feed water to the waterbodies. The diversion of storm water channel has led to the dry condition of the waterbodies, so the diversion should be prohibited and should not be included in the waterbodies rejuvenation activity,” EMPRI stated.Defending the committee’s report back then, Koliwad had said: “The government can explore the possibility of diverting Rajakaluves, if possible, instead of bringing huge structures down.”This came as a relief to a hospital belonging to senior Congress leader Shamanur Shivashankarappa and the house of Sandalwood actor Darshan, both located in Rajarajeshwari Nagar. The hospital and the actor’s house were issued demolition notices, but alas.In a landmark ruling in May 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had redefined buffer zone as 50m from the edge of primary Rajakaluves, 35m from secondary Rajakaluves and 25m from tertiary Rajakaluves. Construction activity was prohibited in this space. The Koliwad committee stated that since the NGT order was being heard by the Supreme Court, the government was asked to act based on the outcome of the case.The Koliwad committee also refrained from naming erring officials, builders and government bodies that encroached waterbodies and drains. Instead, it recommended setting up of a judicial commission to identify and act against those responsible for encroachments.The committee did suggest a way forward for the Urban Development Department. It asked authorities to ensure, during approval and formation of new layouts, the drainage systems are capable of carrying water in line with the watershed requirements while retaining the direction in which the water naturally flows in that region. The Koliwad committee report is pending before Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, whose pronounced concern for waterbodies led to the House panel’s birth.READ MORENo action on officials, builders for drain encroachment	drain encroachment,	 Sep 30 2018
Restoration of SWDs key to city’s survival	These structures are unique to Bengaluru. Unlike most other cities in the world, Bengaluru has no perennial river.Arakavathi, Suvarnamukhi and Kumudavathi are only seasonal streams. Therefore, since 1537 when Kempegowda established Bengaluru, lakes were constructed. His son, Immadi Kempe Gowda, and grandson established more lakes. This was followed by the Marathas, Wodeyars, Tipu Sultan and the British.With an elevation of 3,000 feet, Bengaluru slopes on all directions. A cascading system of lakes was established with 30-feet-wide Rajakaluves, dug from one lake to the next, taking the excess water till the last level of lakes, thus storing the 800mm normal annual rainfall in nature’s most effective Rainwater Harvesting System. The SWD is, therefore, the crux of the city’s water supply over centuries.However, what has been lovingly built over the past five centuries, Bengaluru has managed to destroy in 50 years. One of the biggest tanks, the Dharmambudhi Kere, expanded by Kempe Gowda, is now the Central Bus Terminus, ironically named after Kempe Gowda, making him turn in his grave. The government itself breached at least 43 tanks and constructed stadiums, colleges, offices and Golf clubs. This encouraged greedy citizens in forming private lake “Layouts”, some of the MLAs affixing the title Layout to their names!The SWDs are the channels which connected the famed ‘thousand lakes’ of Bengaluru, forming an integrated system. Within the BBMP area of 780km² there is a length of 857 km of SWDs. But, these vital SWDs have been totally neglected since the two Municipal Boards of the Bangalore City Municipality and the Cantonment were merged into form the Corporation of the City of Bangalore in 1949 and 70 councilors were elected from 50 wards. The city’s population in 1951 was 7.8 lakh and it is now 112 lakh.The lakes will survive only if the SWDs exist to take the overflow of water from the higher level lakes to the lower lakes. As the SWDs are destroyed, even with two inches of rain, the water flows onto the roads, which become canals. Worse, the SWDs are used even by the BWSSB to let in domestic sewage so that each remaining lake in Bangalore Urban Revenue district (of its original 937 according to Revenue Records of Villages) stores domestic sewage, apart from industrial effluents, and none of the lake water is fit for drinking.In 2010, a Master Plan was prepared for the restoration and remodelling of the damaged SWDs at a cost of Rs 4,158 crore. This was shelved by the Government and two years ago, a paltry Rs 800 crore was sanctioned to take up this work, obviously in politically important wards. But, it is not realised that restoration of SWDs is not just removal of encroachment, which itself is a huge task, but more importantly involve desilting, widening, deepening, constructing masonry walls, box drains, culverts, shifting of sewage from the SWDs, etc. This is a mammoth task and government’s sanctioning of Rs 800 crore or so is like offering popcorn to the hungry elephant. Two years ago, the BBMP with fanfare started removal of encroachments on SWDs under the High Court directions but was stopped in its tracks when properties of political and film personalities were encountered. Recently, the government has initiated prosecution proceeding against 20 senior officers for permitting important persons to encroach upon SWDs.Citizens of Bengaluru do not realise that restoration of SWDs is the key to restoration of lakes which in turn is necessary for the survival of Bengaluru. There are 25 lakh tenements in BBMP’s population of 112 lakh according to Census-2011 of which the BWSSB’s water and drainage connection covers only 40%. The rest depends upon borewells and according to the study of NITI Aayog recently, Bengaluru will run out of groundwater in just two years.Not only that. The 60% population which has no drainage connection, produce 128 grams of night soil per capita daily, which is 800 tonnes per day and 3 lakh tonnes per year. Most of this human excreta finds its way to the lakes which is why the Land of a Thousand Lakes has now become a Land of a Thousand Sewage Tanks. The sewage does not simply sit in the tank beds but percolates into the groundwater and into the borewells.Bellandur and Varthur are burning. Waiting in the queue are Byramangala, Yele Mallappa Chetty, Kaggadaspura, Yemmlur, Iblur and sixty more. Bengalureans have not realised the seriousness of Bellandur burning.In Karnataka, the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the Pollution Control Board came into existence in 1974 and the lakes are burning since 2017.

Underpass work to add to traffic on Varthur bridge	will endure unsustainable levels of traffic as work on an underpass at Kundalahalli junction in Whitefield begins.Kundalahalli junction is a vital link to the areas in IT corridor like ITPL, Hoodi, Marathahalli, Domlur and other surrounding areas.Heavy vehicles roll by this junction in their thousands from places like Hoskote, Kadugodi, Whitefield, Varthur and Sarjapura.When the underpass work at the junction picks up, all the vehicles will be routed through Belagere road, which is also the only alternative for commuters to circumvent the traffic snarl at the junction.“Office-goers choose the shortest and the most convenient route,” said Naveen A, a commuter. “Google Maps suggests Belagere road as the best route to reach IT corridors around Marathahalli and Bellandur.”And here is the catch: vehicles must first pass through the Varthur bridge to reach Belagere road.The heavy traffic will be an added stress on the bridge, which, regular commuters say, has begun to wobble again. “The BBMP has completed the grouting work, but is yet to seal the cracks with the bonding agent,” said Jagadish Reddy, Varthur lake warden.Reddy said residents are alerting the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike on the repeatedly developing cracks and have urged the civic body to take action. “Until the new bridge (adjacent to the old one) comes up, we’ve to commute with fear and anger,” Reddy added.The repair work should have been completed three months ago. Now, BBMP officials say it would go on for two more weeks. “The delay is due to paucity of labour. We’ve the materials ready on site and will finish the work soon,” a BBMP official said.The Palike’s chief engineer KT Nagaraj said work for the underpass has just begun at Kundalahalli junction. “Right now, we’re sorting out water pipes and Bescom utilities,” he said.

BTM Layout residents adopt Kuvempu Park	with the BBMP’s maintenance of the parks in their area, and they were tired of complaining.In the end, they decided to adopt the biggest of the 13 parks in the area — Kuvempu park — and turn it into a model green space.“The Kuvempu park here needs at least Rs 25,000 for its maintenance and a part of it is contributed by residents. We cannot take over all the 13 parks for maintenance as we cannot afford it,” said A Vidyashankar, a senior member of the Madiwala Tank Lake Foundation and president of Joint Action Committee, BTM Layout.Residents said the parks lack facilities like water, lights and security. This despite the fact that the state government releases funds once in two years for park maintenance. “Having security guards is important in a fast-growing area like BTM Layout,” Vidyashankar said.As they take up the maintenance of the Kuvempu park, BTM Layout residents ask citizens in other localities to adopt parks, too.“We have not appointed any full-fledged security guards in the parks, but we will appoint them if there is a need in any of the parks,” said Niranjan, horticulture superintendent (south zone).He said vehicles to pick up garbage from the parks are despatched once in a fortnight. “Not much garbage accumulates in the parks. Most of the solid waste is foliage. We have asked residents not to carry plastic materials into the park,” he said.	BBMP,BTM Layout,park,	 Sep 30 2018

Public library in Whitefield set to get a facelift	library situated in the heart of Whitefield, East Bengaluru, are set to receive a facelift. For the residents of Whitefield, it is a shrine of old and delightful books and magazines. Having a membership of around 700 people, the library witnesses an average footfall of about 30 people every day. Yet it is poorly maintained. “The library lacks proper drinking water facilities and lights. Even the books, magazines and papers are not properly arranged,” said a volunteer of the civic initiative Whitefield Rising. It was Whitefield Rising volunteers who brought the poor condition of the library, located in Whitefield Inner Circle Park, to the notice of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). They have helped to arrange some of the bookshelves. “It got a makeover in 2016 thanks to the efforts of bibliophiles and volunteers. Whitefield Rising and the Rotary Bangalore IT Corridor joined hands to give a facelift to the library. They received funds from the State Bank of India. The library could be further improved if the books tied up in gunny bags are arranged properly on the shelves and proper facilities are provided,” said Pravir Bagrodia, another volunteer. The efforts of Whitefield Rising brought about a visit by C Parvathamma, Deputy Director (Libraries), BBMP, on Saturday. She promised that all necessary facilities will be provided. Beginning with fixing the lights, she has promised that an RO water purifier will be provided soon for drinking water. “I will ensure that all genres of books are provided in the library. We will invite people to donate and sponsor these books. I will also deploy some staff to clear the mess on the floors,” she said.	Whitefield,library,	 Sep 27 2018
Break in Green Line services traps people at KG station	(Yelachenahalli-Nagasandra) led to heavy crowd at the Kempegowda metro station on Thursday morning.A train from Yelachenahalli to Nagasandra halted near the National College metro station around 9.46 am. Train movements on both the lines were disrupted for the next hour till services were restored at 10.57 am, a release from the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) said.“There was a large crowd at the Kempegowda metro station as trains were not moving. Especially on the Green Line platforms, the security guards had a tough time as many passengers lost patience,” a BMRCL official said.BMRCL said the train had to be withdrawn from passenger service and the process delayed the running of the other train. The crowd at Kempegowda was the cumulative effect of the delay, it said.The official said disruption in services on any line will inevitably lead to a crisis-like situation at the Kempegowda station. “As it was the peak hour, there were many people who were getting late to office and that led to angry exchanges,” a commuter said.Additional trainThe BMRCL deployed additional trains from Nagasandra, Rajajinagar and Peenya Industry metro station to ease the situation.“Before normalcy was restored, passengers travelling in the train at National College, Rajajinagar, Peenya Industry and Sampige Road stations had to be detrained and cleared by the following trains,” the release said.

KC Valley water conforms to eco norms, govt tells HC	High Court that the quality of treated water supplied under the KC Valley project meets the surface water standards prescribed under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.A division bench headed by the Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari was hearing a public interest litigation challenging the KC Valley project on the ground that the treated water from Bengaluru was polluting groundwater in Kolar, causing health problems to local people.In the last hearing, the state government had submitted the results of the laboratory analysis of water samples after secondary treatment.The memorandum submitted by the government advocate said that on September 11, the court had permitted the government to pump the treated water from jack well 1 at KC Valley to jack well 2 (located at Bellandur Amanikere village) to enable the authorities to collect the water sample for analysis. The samples were sent to the lab set up by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the Environmental Health and Safety Research and Development Centre.The government counsel further added that the government was not releasing water for irrigation, but was only facilitating recharging of groundwater. The court directed the petitioners' counsel to submit their response to the report submitted by the state government. The hearing was adjourned to Thursday.	KC Valley Project,	 Sep 27 2018

BDA to take up repair of Hebbal Flyover immediately	work on the Hebbal Flyover after a minor crack developed on one of its loop last week. All officials have been asked to take up investigation and maintenance work of the Hebbal Flyover on an immediate basis. Though the crack developed on a section that is being maintained by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), the BDA has now taken it upon itself to repair it.“For people’s safety and to ensure that there is no untoward incident the BDA has decided to take up the maintenance of the flyover. However NHAI will have to cooperate. The work will be taken up immediately after conducting an inspection. The cost has not been decided yet,” the source added.These decisions were taken at a high-level meeting convened on Tuesday to address the issues faced by the arterial link connecting north Bengaluru with the Kempegowda International Airport.During the meeting three key issues were highlighted- lapses on the part of the BDA in maintaining the flyover, water logging in the drains and sewage lines and the need to recheck all the bearings. “All the bearings are submerged in the stagnated water. That needs to be cleared. The commuters are also facing a lot of problem due to that. The officials were questioned about why it was not cleared in the last two days. The bearings will also have to be checked. Another problem we face is that the Hebbal lake is filled to the brim. The BWSSB has been directed to handle the water-logging issue on war-footing,” sources present in the meeting told DH.Officials from BDA, NHAI, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) have been asked to take immediate action. They have been directed to clear the stagnant water below the flyover where the bearings have been submerged. The work will start after a team visits the flyover on Wednesday.

Infosys foundation revives Chola-era Kalyani 	(temple tank) on the premises of the Chola-era Vasantha Vallabharaya Temple in South Bengaluru on Monday.The Infosys Foundation restored the tank, which faced the threat of being reduced to half its size by land grabbers, to its original form.Legend has it that Chhatrapati Shivaji’s father Shahaji Raje Bhonsle constructed the Kalyani sometime in the mid 17th century to mark the acquisition of Bengaluru as his jagir. It is said Bhonsle had won this jagir after defeating Kempegowda-III.Over a period of time, the temple tank, which is spread over two acres on paper, was in danger of disappearing due to officials apathy.The foundation has spent Rs 8.5 crore for the restoration work and handed over the tank to the muzrai department in the presence of the chief minister.DH had earlier reported the attempts to grab the temple tank and money meant for the Kalyani development.

4 lakes in city south breach from heavy rain	– Dorekere Lake, Gubbalala Lake, Vasanthapura Lake and Doddakallasandra Lake have all breached due to heavy rain in the wee hours of Monday.Areas around the Kanakapura Road received maximum rainfall recording more than 124 mm rain around Konanakunte, Doddakallasandra, Uttarahalli, and Rajarajeshwarinagar, Kengeri and Hemmigepura.The lakes breached and flooded the stormwater drains and even entered houses in many low-lying areas. Despite the BBMP stating to have taken measures to ensure that the lake water does not flood residential areas, it seems like it was only assurance and no actual work is done.DH based on a BBMP report had on June 30, 2018, reported that the five lakes in Bengaluru South are likely to breach this monsoon.Sunday night rain brought horror to residents of Saptagiri Layout, Lakshmaiah Layout and Lakkanna Layout, with over 200 houses flooded with the rainwater in the wee hours on Monday.These layouts are located behind Subramanyapura police station in Uttarahalli.Shivanagamma, who owns a flour mill in the area, was in a shock to find her mill submerged in the rainwater.“The motors are in a good condition. But if the water gets into the motors, they will stop functioning, and we will lose our livelihood. We drained the water and removed the motors from the machine. But we are not sure if the mill can function now,” she added.Asha Babu, another resident, said there was water up to four feet in the area and, contaminated water entered the sump in her house.“We woke up at around 2 am and have not slept a wink since then as there is a fear of flood. Every year during rains, there was waterlogging on the streets. But this time, the water has entered the houses,” she added. Savitha Jayasimha broke while explaining the difficulty she faced protecting her children who were sleeping when the house was flooded.“For the past three years, it has been continuously flooding, and there is no one to stop this. I had to wake up my children to move them to a safer place when the water entered the houses,” she added.Uttarahalli coporator Hanumanthaiah, who visited the area, said since Dorekere Lake breached due to the heavy rain, the overflowing stormwater drain in the downstream flooded many areas including Saptagiri Layout.A local resident said an apartment was constructed on the stormwater drain and the Bangalore International Public School had also encroached upon the drain. And so there is very less space for the rainwater to flow.Three upstream lakes of Hulimavu — Subrayanapura, Kalena Agrahara and Basavanapura — are also said to have overflown.Doddakallasandra, the erstwhile gram panchayat village located off Kanakapura Road, was turned into a sludge after the rain.The village is now the part of 110 villages. The BBMP had dug up the road on Kumaran School to lay underground drainage pipelines.After the rain, with the sludge filling the entire area, it became difficult for the commuters even to walk on the road and many vehicles got stuck in the sludge.

Banaswadi-Hosur train service to resume in December	the Banaswadi-Hosur train is likely to resume in December once the railway track renewal gets over. The introduction of four services (two from each side) had given hope to people fighting for suburban services. The trains from Banaswadi have an added advantage of being connected to the metro station at Baiyappanahalli, an aspect that urban transport activists have been stressing for years. The railways cancelled the train services between May 26 and October 25 for the renewal and maintenance work. Officials had promised to restart the services once the work is completed in October. But this could happen only in December, South Western Railway Chief Public Relations Officer E Vijaya said. “Track renewal works are expected to continue until November, and the train services will be considered for introduction in December,” she added.‘Make it passenger-friendly’Meanwhile, the SWR has released a data showing poor occupancy of trains, each of which has a seating capacity of 650 people. While the average ridership on the four services was less than 10%, the afternoon train from Banaswadi saw an occupancy of just 4.91%. Suhas Narayanamurthy, a software engineer who travels regularly between Hebbal and Heelalige, said the ridership would go up automatically if the railways aligned its services with passengers’ needs. “Structural changes are needed to make trains on the Hosur line passenger-friendly. But before that, the railways should work on timings. Let them run a train around 10 am from Banaswadi and 4.30 pm from Hosur and check the ridership,” he said.	Suburban railway,	 Sep 24 2018
‘All potholes in Bengaluru will be filled by today’	by Monday. Speaking to DH, M R Venkatesh, engineer-in-chief, BBMP, said, “We are taking up the work the whole night and will finish the repair.”Asked about the shoddy work and city outskirts not being included in the exercise, Venkatesh said those roads were not being repaired as the BWSSB was laying water pipelines in 110 villages.“About 1,800 km of road is dug up and the repair on these stretches can be taken up only after the BWSSB finishes the project.”Venkatesh said 200 km of roads where the BBMP has taken up white-topping, Tendersure and other projects across the city were also not included.“Since we have diverted traffic to small roads to facilitate these projects, they have suffered damages. We will take up repair work on these roads after the major road projects are done,” he said.Rejecting the complaint of shabby work, he said, “We are filling wet mix to potholes with cement, stones and water along with quarry dust. This is a graded material filled to the base course.”	potholes,	 Sep 24 2018
Public library in Whitefield set to get a facelift	library situated in the heart of Whitefield, East Bengaluru, are set to receive a facelift. For the residents of Whitefield, it is a shrine of old and delightful books and magazines. Having a membership of around 700 people, the library witnesses an average footfall of about 30 people every day. Yet it is poorly maintained.“The library lacks proper drinking water facilities and lights. Even the books, magazines and papers are not properly arranged,” said a volunteer of the civic initiative Whitefield Rising. It was Whitefield Rising volunteers who brought the poor condition of the library, located in Whitefield Inner Circle Park, to the notice of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). They have helped to arrange some of the bookshelves. “It got a makeover in 2016 thanks to the efforts of bibliophiles and volunteers. Whitefield Rising and the Rotary Bangalore IT Corridor joined hands to give a facelift to the library. They received funds from the State Bank of India. The library could be further improved if the books tied up in gunny bags are arranged properly on the shelves and proper facilities are provided,” said Pravir Bagrodia, another volunteer. The efforts of Whitefield Rising brought about a visit by C Parvathamma, Deputy Director (Libraries), BBMP, on Saturday. She promised that all necessary facilities will be provided. Beginning with fixing the lights, she has promised that an RO water purifier will be provided soon for drinking water. “I will ensure that all genres of books are provided in the library. We will invite people to donate and sponsor these books. I will also deploy some staff to clear the mess on the floors,” she said.	public library,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,Whitefield,Whitefield Rising,BBMP,	 Sep 23 2018
Polluting SWD a major threat to Agara lake’s ecosystem	of waste is threatening to contaminate the Agara Lake, thanks to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) apathy despite complaints by local residents.As the garbage clogs the drain near the bridge closer to the lake, residents fear that the place –already a rich breeding ground for mosquitoes- would transform into a chief source of vector borne diseases. They also give the place close to the drain a wide birth, assailed by the putrefying odour emerging from the drain’s rotten depths.The trouble started when sewage began flowing into the drain from houses in Bommanahalli and Roopena Agrahara months ago, which officials ignored. The recent rains worsened the situation by choking the inlet with garbage, mostly plastic waste. Activists warned that turning a blind eye to the situation would threaten the lake’s ecosystem. “It has been four years since the rajakaluve (SWD) was de-silted,” said Kavitha Reddy, a Lake Activist and KPCC spokesperson.As sewage continues to flow through the drain, Members of Agara Lake Protection and Management Society (ALPMS) urged the BBMP to clean the SWD, but the civic body did not pay heed, Kavitha said. Activists stacked up sandbags to heighten the lake bund where the sewage water is entering the water body.“This’s not going to stop sewage, but this would at the very least prevent garbage from floating around the lake’s water,” Kavitha said.BBMP officials on the other hand rejected claims that water from the drain is polluting the lake, insisting that periodic de-siltings were taking place throughout the ward.Agara residents complain that the lake’s Kalyani has also been polluted after Ganesha immersions. “BBMP has collected the waste from the lake’s banks but they should do something about water in the Kalyani,” said a resident.

All 198 wards will get Wi-fi hotspots in 6 months: DyCM	"hotspots within the next six months, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara announced after inaugurating the Shakthi Soudha in western Bengaluru's Govindarajanagar on Sunday. Parameshwara, also the Bengaluru Development Minister, inaugurated Atal Ji Stadium, Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Centre and a statue of the city's founder Nadaprabhu Kempegowda besides a free Wi-fi hotspot in Govindarajanagar. In all, the new projects cost around Rs 4 crore, officials said. ""Today the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has introduced a free Wi-fi hotspot in Govindarajanagar. A similar initiative will be launched in all the 198 wards within six months. I have directed the civic body officials to collect Rs 2,500 crore in property tax and generate revenue from other possible sources to take up development works in the city,"" Parameshwara said."

'Rlys must work on auto signalling to run more trains'	"for the suburban railways has also hit the installation of automatic signalling, a cost-effective method to increase the capacity of rail lines for local trains without waiting for Rs 12,000 crore to complete the project. Noting that the SPV has been delayed by one-and-a-half years, urban transport activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar said the state government and the railway should implement the work on a cost-sharing basis without the SPV. ""Automatic signalling costs about Rs 1.15 crore per km and takes a fraction of the time required for building new infrastructure like an elevated railway line. Instead of waiting for an SPV, small projects like this should be taken up on priority,"" he said. Known as Automatic Block Signalling (ABS), the mechanism has proved to be safer than manual signalling and helps to run more trains on a stretch of the railway track which is divided into 'blocks'. The South Western Railway has repeatedly said that the track capacity had been saturated and it would not be possible to introduce more trains. However, the railways told the state government last year that the SPV will install the ABS for three key railway lines from KSR Bengaluru station to Mandya, Tumakuru and Yelahanka. As per the official data, most of the railway lines in Bengaluru have 90% occupancy with the only exception being Chikkaballapur and Mandya (Mysuru) lines. Only 63% of the track capacity is used on the KSR Bengaluru-Yeshwantpur stretch and barely 50% for the Yeshwantpur-Yelahanka and 29% for the Yelahanka-Chikkaballapur. On the other hand, occupancy surges beyond its capacity to 101% on the Baiyappanahalli-Whitefield line. A senior railway official said the SPV would be better equipped to ensure that there are no financial delays. ""The state has delayed payments for various projects and the railways has had to wait for budgetary allocations. The SPV has the capacity to settle such issues quickly,"" the official said. Train to airportSpeaking about the possibility of introducing trains to the airport, a railway official said though the line was clear, congestion at Yeshwantpur station makes it difficult to run trains. ""The morning and evening hours, when the suburban trains will be needed, see peak occupancy in stations due to the arrival/departure of long-distance trains,"" he said."

Productivity, health dipping due to traffic chaos	suburban rail or the Metro cope up? How do they negotiate the massive traffic jams that have become a daily ordeal? DH dived deep into these areas to understand the commute struggles.In areas such as R T Nagar, Airport Roads both new and old, Sanjaynagar, Koramangala, Silk Board and other localities, peak hour traffic often brings commuters to a virtual halt. The proximity of arterial roads in these areas to industries and corporate offices makes it worse. Besides the narrow and congested roads, there are no alternatives.Lack of proper transport planning has meant the densely populated residential areas and IT hubs of Bengaluru are not connected by multi-modal commute options. The result: Lakhs of commuters are caught on the road with their productivity and health taking a huge toll.Many techies working in Manyata Tech Park, Electronics City and Whitefield are forced to depend on buses or their own private vehicles. Humungous traffic jams at the Silk Board Junction, for instance, tests the patience of road-users. The promise of a Metro line linking this crowded junction to K R Puram and beyond through the Outer Ring Road (ORR) is yet to get to action mode.Mitali Kulkarni, a software professional staying in HSR Layout, narrates her daily experience: “It takes me almost two hours at times to cover an eight-kilometre distance to Embassy Tech Village. The severe traffic congestion on ORR is the main reason.”She is convinced that the number of employees commuting on this stretch will only increase. “Metro trains should have been up and running here three to four years ago. But I don’t see any plan for it even now. So we, commuters as a community are continuing to spend many unproductive hours, helplessly stuck in traffic,” she says.Many find it hard to digest that the government has paid no attention to address their travel woes despite their long years of struggle. Ajay Bharadwaj, a frequent commuter on Varthur Road says, “This area was nearer to my office. But whenever I wanted to commute to Majestic / City Railway station, it was quite an ordeal to make it on time to catch the bus/train.”On many occasions, Bharadwaj just made it to the trains at the last moment. The heavy traffic congestion on Old Airport Road never gave him any respite. He believes in enhancing Metro connectivity at the earliest.But there are also a number of commuters who do not mind travelling 1-2 kilometres to get to a station. It would be far better than getting stuck endlessly in a traffic jam.Yet, there is no such luck for people residing along Bannerghatta Road. The Metro line planned here is expected to take several years to be commisioned. Says a resident, Ramya Nagaraj: “Bannerghatta road is known for its full-blown traffic. Thousands of commuters struggle on this congested road for hours to reach work places and schools.”The same story repeats in Electronics City, Silk Board Junction and Koramangala, where the only way to get from place to place is the road. Neethu Kashetter talks about the need for alternative options, such as suburban rail and the Metro. That, she says, would make life far easier. If the stations are well connected by last-mile commute options, travelling between work places, commercial centres and schools can get better.	commuters,Bengaluru,traffic,Transport,	 Sep 22 2018
Whitefield citizens to protest poor condition of road	Nallurahalli near Whitefield not improving for many years now, the residents of both the areas will be protesting next week.“The entire length of the road is marked by potholes and there have been no attempts to fill them as yet. There are no footpaths for the pedestrians to walk. Also plenty of illegal road-side encroachments by vendors and junkyard establishments,” said a resident of Siddapura.He added, “With the drastic increase in traffic to and from EPIP and ITPL- the IT corridors in Whitefield area, the current road connecting to these points from Siddapura has turned into a nightmare for regular commuters. The existing road is hardly 15 to 18 feet. Yet many people park illegally across the road.” The road widening project was stopped some years back after some land owners refused to give their land. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike (BBMP) claims that some land owners are refusing to accept the TDR (Transferable Development Rights) and it is taking time to convince them.To raise these demands the residents propose to protest on September 29 from 10 am to 12 noon.	potholes,Whitefield ,road,protest,	 Sep 22 2018

Most waste-to-energy plants idle as BBMP drags its feet	"Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to take up the biomining of quarries filled with waste. But out of the 13 biomethanisation plants, only three are operational as the civic body is dragging its feet over issuing a work order. Biomining involves processing waste to produce energy. In 2016, the BBMP had set up 13 biomethanisation plants to reduce the city's garbage problem. The contracts had been awarded to Mailhem Engineers for three plants and to Ashoka Biogreen for 10 plants. The plants were working well for two years, but the BBMP neither renewed the work orders nor retendered 11 plants after the which the contractors stopped operating them. Gautham, Bengaluru-in-charge of Mailhem Engineers Pvt Ltd, which was managing three plants in Mathikere, Kuvempunagar and Gandhinagar wards, told DH: ""As of now, we are only operating the Kuvempunagar plant and for the other two plants, we have been repeatedly approaching the BBMP to issue the work orders that expired in March 2018. But they have not responded so far."" He continued: ""There is also a payment issue from the BBMP. We have written many letters with regard to payments. If the civic body issues the work order and pays the dues, we are ready to operate the plants."" The biomethanisation plants would convert biodegradable waste into energy and can process five tonnes of wet waste a day, according to the contractors. The energy generated by these plants was used to power up street lights in the area. Additional Commissioner (Administration) BBMP, D Randeep, told this newspaper: ""Most of the biomethanisation plants are not functional in the city except the three. Since these plants have only 60-70% capacity, we are doing a stock-taking exercise to enhance the capacity and utilisation of these plants."" ""I will hold a meeting with officials and managers of the plants to tell them that maximum efforts should go towards sending the waste to the compost and biomethanisation plants,"" he added."	biomethanisation,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,National Green Tribunal,	 Sep 22 2018

Trucks dumping trash in lakes seized; owner booked	against trucks dumping garbage onto the lake bed in Anugondanahalli village at the outskirts of Southeast Bengaluru. Operating for garbage contractors within the city they have been dumping filth into the Medimallasandra lake bed for the past four to five months, the police say.“As residents are not coming forward to lodge complaints fearing the garbage mafia, we have taken suo-motu complaints to curb this menace,” said a senior police officer.The police have registered two cases against the owners of three trucks, who are garbage contractors in the city, and their drivers. Receiving complaints from nearby residents that trucks loaded with garbage moved towards the lake at different times, the police confronted them in the act and seized the vehicles along with the leftover garbage.“We were told the trucks use the Anugondahalli village route and head towards Doddaballapura where there is a dump yard. However to make some quick bucks the drivers cut their journeys short and dump the garbage in such secluded places,” the officer said quoting the truck owners who pleaded ignorance and blamed their drivers.The Anugondanahalli police of the Thirumalashettihalli circle are patrolling intensely around the lake all day round to prevent the trucks from entering the lake premise.“We have also written letters to Panchayat Development Office (PDO) Anugondanahalli about this, but the officials are not addressing the issue. So we have intensified the patrolling and seizing the trucks ourselves,” the senior police officer said.	Garbage,	 Sep 22 2018
OK to dump sewage anywhere: BWSSB staff	over the apathetic approach of civic bodies towards cleaning up lakes in the city. But for sanitary workers of the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), it is “normal practice” to dispose of untreated sewage wherever they please.At least that is what two sanitary workers did near Hosmat hospital on Wednesday. They were caught red-handed by research associate Lakshmikantha of the Namma Bengaluru Foundation.The driver of the jetting machine vehicle and the sanitary worker are seen blatantly saying in the video that “disposing of untreated sewage anywhere is normal practice”. On Lakshmikantha’s Twitter handle, many commented about raw sewage being disposed of in many locations, including the lakes in Bengaluru. Dinakar, in-charge, engineer, BWSSB, said the workers should ideally dispose of sewage in a nearby manhole that is functioning well, and that if only silt is collected, it has to be taken to BWSSB’s designated dump yard near Bommanahalli.The Namma Bengaluru Foundation is most likely to file a complaint with the police and also inform the NGT.The NGT, in its April 2017 order, had clearly stated that “If anybody is found to be dumping waste of any kind either in the lake or in the buffer zone, he shall be liable to pay an environmental compensation of Rs 5 lakh per event.”BWSSB chairperson Tushar Giri Nath squarely blamed the sanitary workers for the “blunder”.“Ideally, they should have disposed of the sanitary waste in a manhole which is working fine or the nearest sewage treatment plant. We are going to educate our sanitary workers on how to dispose of untreated sewage and also brief our engineers to monitor the same,” he said.	BWSSB,	 Sep 22 2018
Church St. cobblestones loosen twice in 6 months	on the renovated Church Street are coming loose. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has identified about five to six ‘bad patches’ along the street where cobblestones have got dislodged, and the civic body has begun repairing them by strengthening the base.A BBMP worker who was repairing cobblestones near Indian Coffee House on Friday afternoon said they were replacing the cobblestone after strengthening them with cement in the same place. He said heavy traffic was one of the reasons why they were coming loose.Lokesh, executive engineer, TenderSURE project, BBMP said officials are closely monitoring the work. “A total of 2.5 lakh cobblestones have been laid on the street. Since this is still in the defect liability period, we are asking the contractors to do the work,” said Lokesh. K T Nagaraj, chief engineer, road infrastructure, (projects), BBMP said pouring water on the street is also another reason for this problem. “A house near the Rest House Road junction is using a hosepipe to pour water on the street. This has become a huge problem,” he said.Nagaraj said they will soon lodge a police complaint against this menace. “We have sent a notice to the resident,” he said. The Church Street remodelling project under TenderSURE has cost the civic body Rs 14 crore and was inaugurated in March this year by former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. The project was earlier scheduled to have been completed by August 2017.	Church Street,	 Sep 21 2018

Lalbagh lake gets colourful with water lily plants	rejuvenate the lake in Lalbagh and beautify the waterbody with the idea of drawing more visitors. “We have introduced nymphaea plants, instead of lotus. This is the first time we have done it and it is showing results,” said M Jagadeesh, Joint Director, Horticulture Department, Lalbagh. Nymphaeas (water lilies) are preferred over lotus because they are less vigorous and easy to maintain. Over 150 plants of 40 varieties in five different colours will be introduced into the lake. The Department began introducing Nymphaeas two months ago and will continue with the project for another couple of months. Visitors to the garden will find the lake resplendent with the colourful plants, which were grown in the Department’s nurseries. Even as it enhances the lake’s beauty, the Department is also setting up a viewing deck on the lines of Mandya’s Gaganachukki waterfalls. Jagadeesh said the 20 feet tall and 15 feet wide viewing deck is made near the bridge and retention wall of the lakes. Putting up a tall viewing deck is also to allow visitors the glimpse of the area’s biodiversity, especially of the wetlands surrounding the waters. The wetland is home to several bird species that include the migratory variety seen roosting there most times of the year. The department is also planning to install a telescope on the deck for better viewing and is in discussions on where to get one.	Lake,water lilies,Lalbagh,Horticulture Department,	 Sep 21 2018
Commuters battle road rollers amidst peak hour jams	dream. But the dream turned into a nightmare on Friday morning, when road-rollers and contractors were blocking prime intersections in the city in a bid to fill the potholes, adding to the traffic snarls.“I understand that the BBMP is supposed to follow the court orders and repair the roads. But the timing is putting us in trouble. Because they did not do their work in the past in a planned manner, the public has to face the brunt now. Also, how much will this patchwork help in giving us smooth roads?” Nagaraj, a motorist said.The intersection on Hosur Main Road was one of the busy roads that were chosen for repair during the peak hours of Friday morning. However, a road-roller and contractors along with workers running around to fill potholes in the middle of the main road added up to the chaos.“The traffic police have a tough time managing the traffic here even on normal days. The BMTC buses and vehicles are out of control, especially at this time. The BBMP is more than welcome to repair the roads. But they should not add to our peak hour troubles,” Aishwarya Shankar, an artist said.Citizens also felt that the work taken up in a hurry to meet a deadline would not last and would also do more harm than help.“I am sceptical if these patches will withstand even one spell of rain. For the sake of it, the work will be done in a sub-standard manner, and one shower will bring these roads back to square one. It’s like we have to choose between pothole-free road or no extra trouble during the peak hours” Aishwarya added.However, the BBMP requested people to be patient. Venkatesh M R, the Engineer in Chief, BBMP, called for co-operation from the public for better roads.“The BBMP is working in the interest of the public. We are doing our best to provide better roads and request the public to cooperate,” Venkatesh said.He promised that the BBMP would take care of the work during the peak hours accordingly and added that the work done round the clock was to repair the potholes instantly.“Peak hours or no peak hours, the BBMP has to attend to all the potholes instantly. We have to comply with the court as well. We are also taking the help of the contractors to reach the deadline,” he explained.	potholes,Bengaluru,BBMP,	 Sep 21 2018
BBMP yet to set up micro ward SWM	the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for poor Solid Waste Management (SWM) in the city, it is yet to set up the proposed micro plants in the city. The BBMP, along with the existing ward committees, had planned to start one SWM plant in each ward to treat 15 tonnes of garbage each day. “The initiative which was to be implemented by now has not taken any shape yet. The BBMP SWM micro plant was to execute segregation-at-source and composting of waste,” said N S Ramakanth, member, SWM Expert Committee.The decision to set them up in all the 198 wards of the city was taken after the court took it to task while hearing a ward committee petition on SWM. “According to the plan one auto tipper would collect segregated garbage from 750 houses in a ward and send it to the micro plant to process it. But so far the authorities have made no effort to set up these plants. The initiative is still pending in front of the BBMP council,” he added.The action plan prepared by the BBMP mandated that the ward committees will be led by the council member, who is also the chairman of the particular ward committee. Members of the committee will monitor the SWM in that ward.An official from BBMP said, “We are in the process of setting up SWM micro plants in all the wards. The council needs to clear the file.”	Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,Karnataka High Court,BBMP,Solid Waste Management,	 Sep 21 2018
Projects held up as state, railways fail to coordinate	has delayed several rail works in the state, from big-ticket projects like the Kolar Coach Factory to new railway lines and even road overbridges. The issue came to the fore in the replies given by the railways to MPs from constituencies that fall in the Bengaluru division of the South Western Railway (SWR) on Tuesday. As delays continue to escalate the costs, activists fear that will finally lead to the shelving of the project. For example, the 53-km Whitefield-Kolar line should have been completed by now.Though the railways gave details of the land required for the project, the government hasn’t yet started the acquisition process, officials told MPs. During the meeting, Chikkaballapur MP M Veerappa Moily enquired about the status of the NES underpass near the Yelahanka station. The railways told him that the BBMP had deposited just Rs 12.58 lakh as against the requirement of Rs 8.03 crore. Tumkur MP, S P Muddahanumegowda, demanded the expedition of work on the Tumakuru-Rayadurga new line and other doubling works.He was told that land acquisition was pending in Tumakuru district for the Rayadurga line while the doubling of the Arsikere-Karadi (36 km) line was in the planning stage. The Kolar line, along with the proposed new line between Bangarpet and Mulbagal which has been put on the backburner, is important if the state government wants to realise the dream of decongesting Bengaluru by developing satellite towns. There were, however, some positive takeaways from the meeting as the railways promised to start the first phase of the Baiyappanahalli coaching terminal by March 2019. The railways also responded positively to the proposed construction of a halt station at Doddanekkundi, which will play a major role as part of the suburban rail network. The much-awaited doubling of Baiyappanahalli–Hosur (48 km) and Yeshwantpur-Channasandra (22 km) lines will start shortly as the SWR is set to invite tender by the end of this month. Suburban rail DPR by November The detailed project report on the 161-km suburban railway network for Bengaluru would be completed by November. The railways will get a preliminary report by the end of September, SWR General Manager A K Gupta said. The state government told the railways that the Karnataka Railway Infrastructure Development Corporation (K-RIDE) is being reorganised to make it part of the special purpose vehicle in which the state and Centre will have an equal share. Govt delaying suburban rail: BJP MP The meeting saw Bangalore Central parliamentarian P C Mohan lashing out at the state government for “delaying” the suburban rail project although the railways went the extra mile by agreeing to bear half of the cost. “Urban transport is a state subject and the railways has taken initiatives to introduce 26 local trains and agreed to increase its share in the project from 20% to 50%. But the state government is not showing any interest,” he said. Railway officials said the MPs promised to meet Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy to urge him to form a special purpose vehicle at the earliest. “The railways has already sanctioned the project. The state government is focused more on its survival than taking up works that benefit the people,” Mohan said.	Bengaluru suburban rail,	 Sep 19 2018
MP asks locals to file complaint against Graphite India	nearby Graphite India Limited (GIL) to file criminal complaint against the company they have been fighting for the last 20 years.Local people have been complaining that the excessive soot emanated by the factory affects their health and creates air pollution.As per the air quality data captured by AirCare- a community-developed air quality monitoring network, PM2.5 (fine particles with a size of 2.5 microns and less measured in micrograms in a cubic meter) is more at Graphite junction.Following complaints by local residents, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in 1998 called for a joint meeting with GIL and directed the factory to install pollution control measures as per Central Pollution Control Board guidelines and replace all machinery. As GIL didn’t follow it, the KSPCB issued a notice and closure order in 2012.But GIL obtained a stay order on the closure notice in 2012. The residents intervened and challenged the stay order and requested the Appellate court to uphold the closure. In 2014, after many hearings, the Appellate court upheld the stay order and allowed GIL to continue operations.The residents challenged the order in National Green Tribunal (NGT). As per the case, the KSPCB inspected the GIL premises in 2017 and the report it submitted indicated that the company did not complete orders by the appellate court. The NGT is yet to make a ruling as the judges on the tribunal benches have retired.GIL’s license ended in June 2018 and KSPCB chairman Lakshman, who was part of Tuesday’s hearing, said the Board will not renew it.MP PC Mohan urged the locals to file a criminal complaint since the company is functioning without license. GIL representatives argued that they are following the NGT orders and their company is not responsible for the pollution in Whitefield. Lakshman said he will personally inspect GIL on Wednesday with his Board members. “The KSPCB will ensure continuous air check from hereafter. We’ll go to the court and strength the case with all documents and technical data. We’ll await court order on the factory’s closure,” he added.	Graphite India Ltd,	 Sep 19 2018
Wilson Garden residents oppose white-topping	Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP)'s white topping work on Tuesday stating that it is not suitable for their vehicles and it will also deplete the ground water.“The white topping project is not suitable for the motorists. The tyres of our vehicles are not designed for concrete roads. They want to lay a white topping on this bad road but it will only harm the road further and will also deplete the ground water,” said Arun Prasad, a protestor.About 50 residents had gathered at the 10th cross, near the Rajkumar statue in Wilson Garden to protest. They also complained against the poor condition of roads and incomplete drainage work in the locality.“We have lodged several complaints with the BBMP to repair these pothole-filled roads since February this year but it has all fallen on deaf ears. Ever since the election work began in the city, all the civic works have come to a halt and we residents are bearing the brunt of it. With the metal railing popping out the open drainage near Agadi Hospital is posing a threat to commuters,” he further added.N Muniyappa, a resident of the locality said that the condition of the road on 10th main, 11th cross at Hombegowda Nagar has deteriorated since the last two years.The residents were accompanied by the members of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and also the Republic Party of India (RPI). The residents also propose to submit a letter to the BBMP Commissioner.	Wilson Garden,	 Sep 18 2018
Residents fume over Bellandur skywalk snail's pace work	Outer Ring Road near Belllandur in Bengaluru East is yet to be open for the public.The resident welfare associations (RWAs) have slammed the inordinate delay in executing the project and exerted pressure on the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to expedite work.The skywalk between Akme Harmony Apartments and Cloudnine Hospital is built based on Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) model.Last year in December, the RWAs under the banner of ‘Bellandur Jothege’ conceived and participated in city’s first community-sourced pedestrianisation programme called ‘Bellandur walks’. Developing better footpaths, adding skywalks and pelican signals were some of the goals of this initiative.They staged a massive protest against the BBMP in December demanding this particular skywalk in Bellandur. The RWAs claimed that the presence of flyovers in the locality had bestowed a luxury of rash driving, which was making it impossible for the pedestrians to cross the road.The BBMP called for tenders on January 17 after the mayor sanctioned the project in December, last year. But the construction work kick-started only in March.The residents urged the BBMP to expedite the construction work pointing out the rise in the number of accident cases in the recent days.“Other than the Sanjaygiri skywalk opposite to Akme Harmony apartments, no skywalks have been built in this highly populous suburb which has an average footfall of 45,000 as many corporate offices and factories are situated here,” said Kishori Mudaliar, a spokesperson of Bellandur Jothege and Bellandur Walks.“The pedestrian toll in Bellandur alone is five in eight months. The BBMP should pay a heed at least now,” he added.Asha Suresh, Bellandur corporator told DH: “This year’s Assembly election had put a brake on the work. From the day poll code came into effect, the work was stopped for about 20 days. Hence, the delay.” She also mentioned heavy traffic as another reason for the delay.She said: “As the traffic is heavy during the daytime, most of the work was carried out during the night time.”“The required construction materials are at the site now. We are going to erect the staircase in the next 10 days. We will assure the completion of entire skywalk in 30 days from today.”	Belllandur,skywalk,Outer Ring Road,	 Sep 17 2018
Kengeri Lake still waits for second shot at life	"some more time to get a new lease of life. Several months after the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) picked a contractor to revive the western Bengaluru lake, there is little or no activity on the ground. There is no semblance of a waterbody. All that exists is a vast spread of weeds, shrubs, bushes, garbage and debris. The 32-acre, 16-gunta lake, also known as Doddakere, is located in the Vrishabhavathi river basin opposite the Kengeri Satellite Town bus station on Mysuru Road in Bengaluru South taluk. The lake was last developed by the forest department in 2005. The department developed islands, pathways and fenced the lake. But poor maintenance over the past years pushed the lake back to square one. The fence is now broken. In 2012, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) handed over the lake to the BMRCL, which showed interest in developing the waterbody as part of its corporate social responsibility. The BMRCL is building two metro stations in the vicinity of the lake. The agency is to develop, restore, maintain and beautify the lake. It plans to build walking paths, a children's play area, a recreation zone, an islet, boating and other facilities. The BMRCL called tenders in June 2017 for rejuvenating the lake, but could not go ahead with the project, owing to encroachments and stringent conditions laid down by the now-defunct Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority. It succeeded only after the third tender and awarded the project to MR Protech Pvt Ltd for Rs 7 crore. BMRCL spokesperson U A Vasanth Rao said the work would start by the end of September. But the delay has hit people hard. People waiting for buses have converted the lakebed into an open urinal. Pushpa, a commuter, complained: ""Vendors have put up pushcarts near the lake and throw leftovers and waste into it. It's embarrassing for women to see men urinate without any inhibition near the lake."" Manjunatha K, a local resident, said: ""Once a beautiful lake, it's now full of weeds and water hyacinth. It stinks badly."""	Kengeri Lake,BMRCL,	 Sep 17 2018
BMTC proposal to lease 500 electric buses on backburner	"which it has described as a raw deal, has put the plan to lease 500 more such buses under a state-funded programme in abeyance.In its last budget, the Siddaramaiah government had assured financial aid to the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) for leasing 1,000 buses. Following the ""cut-price"" offer made by a private company for a previous tender to lease 80 electric buses under a Central scheme, the BMTC board had cleared a proposal to lease 500 such buses three months ago.However, transport minister D C Thammanna has described the lease price quoted by the private player (Rs 24 per km for non-AC bus and Rs 37.45 per km for AC bus) as a ""raw deal"" that needs to be renegotiated.With the corporation set to scrap 1,298 buses that have clocked over 8.5 lakh km by the end of 2018, the delay in the addition of new buses is likely to hit its operations.BMTC managing director V Ponnuraj, who had earlier described the deal as a cost-effective method in testing new technology, refused to comment on the delay in leasing the buses.But sources said it is unlikely that the BMTC would get a better offer. ""We have got the best offer (for leasing 80 buses) at a time when Telangana and Maharashtra are ready to pay more. The tender documents for 500 buses were prepared after we realised that leasing buses will save us more than Rs 10 per km, besides reducing pollution. It was cleared by the previous board three months ago and sent to the minister for approval,"" a source told DH.The minister had previously confirmed that he was holding the files in order to ""ensure that BMTC gets the best offer"". To a question on the delay in the introduction of electric buses at a time when soaring fuel prices were causing losses, he said rushing through the deal would set a ""wrong precedent"" and suggested that the corporation can buy buses instead of leasing them.""The electric bus has no manufacturer in India and BMTC doesn't have any experience in handling that technology. The lease model was not only cheap, but also a strategic move considering that the private operator will take all the risks,"" a source in the government said."	BMTC,electric bus,	 Sep 17 2018
Suburban rail works hit; govt fails to give Binny land	"suburban trains have been put on the backburner, as the Karnataka government is sitting on the railways' request for land for creating additional infrastructure. Following the government's demand for local trains, the South Western Railway (SWR) sought 10 acres of the Binny Mills land next to the Krantivira Sangolli Rayanna railway station in 2012. In January 2017, the government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the suburban rail project, which included a facility to maintain MEMU trains at Banaswadi. The railways sought 40 acres belonging to the NGEF for building the maintenance shed. Railway officials say they have not heard from the government on either land. ""We have not received any communication from the government on facilitating the acquisition of land in both the places,"" R S Saxena, Divisional Railway Manager, Bengaluru, told DH. He said the railways had been running around 100 suburban services with the limited infrastructure and that the introduction of any more services would affect long-distance passenger and freight trains. As per the minutes of a meeting held in August 2017, the government told the railways that acquiring the Binny Mills land, estimated to cost more than Rs 60 crore, would not be feasible. ""We were not consulted before its feasibility was decided. Any suburban network will not be complete without decongesting the KSR station,"" a source in the SWR said. To a question on cost-sharing, the source said such discussions would follow only after the government responded positively to the proposal. ""In 2012, it was the government that suggested we acquire the land. Now, it says that's not feasible,"" he said. Urban transport activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar said acquiring the Binny Mills land was crucial for adding platforms and that the matter had been discussed for almost a decade now. ""Any more delay will directly affect the suburban project and limit the introduction of new long-distance trains. It also affects proposed projects like the Chennai-Mysuru high-speed rail,"" he added. Last year, the government told the railways the NGEF land was ""not encumbrance-free"" as a German company has a 10% stake in the factory. ""Even after the Centre sanctioned Rs 29.5 crore for the project, we are yet to get the land. Now, they are telling us to look for alternative land in Whitefield,"" the source in the railways said."	railway projects,Binny Mills land,	 Sep 17 2018
Bhindi seeds can purify water… say these students	"water is as easy as buying a few grams of bhindi or okra. Improbable as it seems, okra seeds can help bring down the turbidity of water and reduce contamination, the students have found.The three students, from the CMRIT College, have shown through experiments that water can be purified at the initial stage.They first mixed water with soil and used it as sample for their experiment. The collection of water samples was used in a two-three week period and stored at temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, using refrigeration.They collected two different samples of about 40 litres and recorded their raw characteristics. After drying the bhindi seeds, they used them in the powder form to purify the water.""We went through various research papers to ascertain that this is possible,"" said Shivi Shandilya, who worked on the experiment with Shreesh and Rohith N. ""Given that water purification is expensive now, this would help eliminate some amount of particulate matter,"" he said.One of the processes of water treatment is coagulation. In water treatment, coagulation occurs when a coagulant is added to water to ""destabilise"" colloidal suspensions.""Coagulation is one of the cheapest processes for treatment of various organic effluents,"" one of the students said.They believe okra (Abelmoschus Esculentus) is a natural coagulant that works as a cost-effective solution."	okra seeds,water purification,	 Sep 17 2018
High-tension wires above Rajajinagar park poses danger	"which attracts the public in large numbers, is posing a grave danger to the users. A high-tension power transmission wire runs right above the BBMP-maintained Dr B R Ambedkar playground in the Dr Rajkumar ward, which could harm nearly a hundred children in the locality in the wake of an accident. ""The playground is well-maintained, but we are scared of the high-tension wires, which is a threat,"" said Prakash Rao, a resident of Basaveshwaranagar. ""We urge the authorities to shift the lines away from the park."" Developed near Rajajinagar 5th Block, the joggers' park is located right under the high-tension transmission towers.

""The park was developed just three years ago, before which there were only these transmission towers,"" said Miral Jain, who lives nearby. ""Senior citizens visiting the park are avoiding it, especially after the rain."" Roopa R, the corporator of ward number 106 (Dr Rajkumar ward), told DH that a proposal had been mooted to remove the high-tension line in the wake of the threat it poses to the public.Hundreds of children play in the park every day."	power transmission wires,Rajajinagar,high-tension wires,joggers' park,	 Sep 17 2018
KSPCB checking STPs in apts around Hebbal, K&C valleys 	"lakes, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) is now checking ones around Hebbal and Kommaghatta and Challaghatta (K&C) valleys.The board is checking installation and usage of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and has begun slapping notices to apartment complexes. Nearly 50 of them located around the Byaramanagala Lake and Hebbal Valley have received notices.""The apartment dwellers have been asked to attend personally and represent their case. We are checking on those who do not have STPs, those operating without consent and those who didn't renew their STP licences,"" KSPCB chairman Lakshman told DH. The board has given them three to six months' time to comply with the directions. The hearing started a week ago and each apartment complex is being given a time slot to present their case.Reasons for non-compliance include lack of funds, space constraints and fewer occupants.He said that unlike industries or commercial units, closure orders cannot be issued to apartment complexes. But as per the rules, directions can be issued to disconnect their electricity supply and water connection.""We haven't asked Bescom to snap electricity connections so far, but will be forced to do so if the apartments do not comply with the orders and stick to the given time frame,"" Lakshman added.KSPCB is following the National Green Tribunal directions that untreated sewage should not be allowed into the waterbodies. Notices are also served under section 33 (A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.It is also surveying apartments around K&C Valley. The board has also issued instructions to the electroplating and heavy metal industries and other commercial units in the Peenya Industrial Area and around Byramangala Lake to ensure appropriate usage of the STPs.Lakshman said the board is taking into account the use of common effluent treatment plants as several small-scale industries function in the Byramangala Lake and K&C Valley areas.It also regularly monitors the methods adopted to discharge their effluents, while those directly allowing the waste water into the lake will be severely dealt with."

App-based, exclusive office commute cabs enter city	home to office and back, without surge-pricing or the unpredictability of commute time associated with Ola or Uber. Companies in Bengaluru are now switching to this model, offering employees the option as an incentive.Here’s how it works: the app for employees helps him/her book the cab, track it and offer feedback. The driver app gets information on all his trips with a paperless billing process. The billing model differs with companies, although most firms prefer to do it at the end of every month.A key player in this emerging market, Routematic has entered Bengaluru with a three-level internal technology automation solution for a company’s transport team, employees and drivers.“The average commute time from home to office in the city is 55-60 minutes one way. Employers are now offering app-based commute as a perk, something that is available 24/7,” says Routematic co-founder Surajit Das. Ola and Uber might have revolutionised point-to-point commute. Office-goers had switched to this, dumping their personal vehicles. However, surge-pricing, unavailability of these cabs during rains and waiting issues with shared taxis forced employees to look elsewhere.But arranging an office cab meant a complicated process that required documentation, multiple emails and paperwork. “Route automation changed that,” notes Das. “On clicking a button, our app throws up the most optimal routes. Automated tripsheets are delivered to the drivers.”Drivers, just as in the app-based taxi aggregators, own the vehicle. The vast majority, about 70 to 70%, are sedans and hatchbacks. SUVs constitute 13-14%, while 7-8% are made up by 12-17 seaters. “Drivers are guaranteed minimum fares and customers. Suppose an employee is dropped from Electronics City to Hebbal, our network ensures that the return trip is occupied,” Das explains.Presence in Pune Having established itself in Pune, Routematic entered Bengaluru three months ago. With more players emerging in this nascent market, tying up with more companies, the number of private vehicles in the office-home routes could see a dip.Routematic alone has proposed to increase its fleet of vehicles to 2,000 by December 2019.Safety of women passengers has been a big concern. The new platform introduced a set of new features to make it foolproof: women passenger car hot-tracking, safe drop confirmation and a call-masking feature, besides a panic button to trigger emergence response from a company’s transport team.

BBMP stares at revenue deficit plans 	to take off, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike is once again staring at a deficit year.In the 2018-19 fiscal year, the civic body has set a revenue target of Rs 9,322.48 crore accrued through sources like property tax, non-tax revenue, government grants, recovery and refunds.However, a majority of the BBMP’s plans to augment revenue through non-tax measures such as levying entertainment tax, enhancing penalty on authorised optic fiber cable firms, and collecting betterment charges from B-khata properties have not materialised so far.The total station survey by the BBMP’s Standing Committee on Tax and Finance also flopped as the civic body missed out on collecting penalty from those who undervalued their properties. The BBMP was also planning to levy Rs 50,000 for every mobile tower on private land.It recently proposed to levy a ‘Land Transport Cess’ on property owners to boost revenue, but the subject did not even come up for discussion at the BBMP council.“If the state government grants us permission to implement these measures, we will work on improving our revenue collection,” said BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad.However, the BBMP is working hard to achieve its property tax targets since last year. BBMP sources said the shortfall will make it tougher for the civic body to fund the budget projects.This did not deter the Palike from drawing up action plans to implement the budget plans, a move that would result in mounting contractor bills. The civic body currently has outstanding contractor bills up to a whopping Rs 15,462 crore. This is why the BBMP commissioner has asked the state government to bring the civic body under the ambit of the Karnataka Local Fund Authorities and Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2003, and restore financial discipline, sources pointed out.Proposed meaures to boost revenue	revenue deficit,BBMP,	 Sep 15 2018

Work near Doddanekundi flyover delayed	"a flyover at Doddanekundi is getting delayed endlessly. Although the flyover is open for public use, the ongoing work under the structure has turned into a nightmare for commuters.In the aftermath of Friday's rain, the road below the flyover has turned pathetic, leaving vehicles stranded for hours.Bengaluru Development Minister G Parameshwara, who inspected the flyover construction work two months ago, had promised that work at the flyover, including drainage and construction of footpaths on both sides, would be over by September 15. Work on the drains is still dragging on. Residents of Doddanekkundi complained of poor coordination between the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) and the Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA) in carrying out the flyover work.

BBMP slow in collecting data for Swachh Survekshan 2019	began on September 1, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is yet to kick-start the process.Much of the delay is due to lack of infrastructure.The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) guidelines mandate every participating city to provide daily updates on its performance across several categories.For instance, local bodies must input information (online) on collection –both primary and secondary-, transport and process of garbage on a daily basis.Nearly a week and a half after the data collection began, the BBMP is only now starting off with the process to create the Programme Management Unit (PMU) to provide the daily update, including a dedicated set-up to document and validate data.“We’ve had initial rounds of meetings,” said Randeep D, BBMP’s special commissioner for Solid Waste Management. “We’ll set-up the PMU and deploy full-time staff to do the data validation.”The unit would have SWM experts, environmentalists and even data entry operators, he added. He said the civic body would build on the data collected by the war room set-up during last year’s Swachh Survekshan survey. But the BBMP must validate much of the primary data gathered back then.“The health department had issued licenses for several commercial establishments to function. But the data on how many of those units are paying commercial tax is yet to be validated,” Randeep pointed out, adding that those discrepancies will be fixed this time for a better rating.Some SWM experts are concerned about the star rating system introduced from this year in the place of rankings, wondering if Bengaluru can manage even a single star. One of them, V Ramprasad, averred: “The city has a monumental task.”“The MoHUA guidelines have laid Segregation at source, cleaning of stormwater drains and scientific waste processing as some of the basic criteria to get the first star. We’re behind in most of them,” he added.	Swachh Survekshan 2019,	 Sep 13 2018
BDA seeks aid from BBMP, says needs Rs 6,000 crore	from Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and other government agencies, saying the fund’s crunch could jeopardise some of its projects.At the last BDA board meeting, chaired by Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara, the financial crisis of BDA was tabled and discussed. The BDA officials proposed to the government and the agencies seeking their help.“We have told the government that we need Rs 6,000 crore to execute all the works. We need Rs 4,500 crore alone to execute new projects. But the question is how to raise the money? While the government has proposed to undertake projects on a partnership basis, the fact is, executing our own ongoing projects is a problem,” sources in the BDA told DH. By selling corner sites in various layouts and available land parcels across the city, the BDA has estimated that it will earn not more than Rs 2,000 crore. But there is a need for Rs 3,200 crore to develop Kempegowda Layout alone and to execute the housing project approved by the BDA Board.There is a need for an additional Rs 2,800 crore to execute infrastructure projects across the city like road widening and flyover works.Thus, the BDA has requested the BBMP to help, the source said.If it fails to get the aid, BDA has planned to put some of its works on the back burner. This list includes re-development of commercial complexes like Jayanagar and Koramangala; and rejuvenation of parks and lakes, as BDA is unable to improve and maintain them. BDA is also contemplating holding back some of its housing projects. The authority has also planned to hold back some infrastructure works like the widening of Hebbal flyover and Hennur flyover.“We have estimated that around Rs 55 crore is needed for the Jayanagar complex alone. We have spent Rs 140 crore on the rejuvenation of lakes but are unable to maintain them. Somebody has to come forward.The BDA pointed out to the government that it should focus on developing layouts and ensuring infrastructure is completed there,” BDA officials told the government representatives.

Scientist gives BBMP quick-fix solution for potholes	"potholes on major stretches could be passe, as a scientist has offered a quick-fix solution.'Kandhal mix' — a ready-to-use cold asphalt mix formulated by Prithvi Singh Kandhal, former professor of the National Centre for Asphalt Technology, Auburn University — comes with the advantage of not having to wait for it to set before being thrown open to vehicles.Top sources in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) confirmed that this would be procured in small quantities and used on a pilot basis.Conducting a demonstration at the Indian Institute of Science following a workshop on pothole solutions, Kandhal said he was willing to offer the formula to the Palike free of cost.Available in 50 kg packs, the concrete mix is poured into potholes and set using a hand-rammer. Put a layer of sand or dry leaves on the mix, and vehicles are ready to go. ""The more the number of vehicles that pass over the mix, the better it sets in,"" said Kandhal.The BBMP is presently using cold mix to asphalt roads in emergency conditions. However, vehicular movement is restricted until the asphalt sets. While the Palike resorts to mixing materials at site, Kandhal mix comes in ready-to-use packets.In the bitumen emulsion and aggregate mix that is currently being used, the setting time may mean several hours depending on weather conditions. ""Once the rain stops, the surface is cleaned and potholes filled. The mix is prepared in situ,"" said S Somashekar, chief engineer, road infrastructure, BBMP.Cost-effectiveWhile the hot mix is manufactured in large quantities to fill potholes, the Kandhal mix could be used in small quantities as it is available in packs. Its production cost is Rs 6 a kilo. Currently, the mix is being used in parts of Jaipur.The professor also said the mixture can be laid on potholes just one hour after the rain. ""One common reason authorities give for not fixing potholes is rain. This is foolproof even that way. Once the rain stops, an hour's gap is all that's needed for work to commence,"" he said."

HC wants details of 1,880 hoardings still left in city	submit details of the 1,880 illegal hoardings and structures that have not been removed by their owners despite being served notices by the civic body. The counsel for the BBMP told the court that 1,987 illegal hoardings still existed in the city and that their owners hadn’t responded to notices so far.But 107 of these hoardings were voluntarily removed by their owners. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari was hearing a PIL petition for removal of illegal flex banners and hoardings. When the court demanded the BBMP what action it would take to remove the 1,880 hoardings, the civic body’s counsel spoke about filing criminal cases. Meanwhile, in an affidavit, the state government submitted that it had examined a letter that sought its approval for the BBMP Outdoor Signage and Public Messaging Policy, 2018, and the BBMP Outdoor Signage and Public Messaging Bylaws, 2018. The government said the policy was essentially a statement of intent and the government has no objections to it. As regards the bylaws, the BBMP has powers under section 425 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, to make them and submit them to the government for sanction. In short, the BBMP should just follow the procedure.The government doesn’t have to take any action as of now, the court was told. The Advocate General stated that he would submit the details of the appeals filed in the sessions court about the offences concerning illegal hoardings. The matter will be heard again on September 17. Govt okays ad bylawsThe Urban Development Department (UDD) on Tuesday approved the BBMP’s proposal on implementing the Outdoor Signage and Public Messaging Policy, 2018. The BBMP council had approved the policy to ban all commercial advertisements in the city following high court orders. The BBMP had sent the bylaws to the government and the letter by the Additional Chief Secretary, UDD, to the commissioner states that the department does not have any objections and the BBMP can go ahead in making a public appeal for a period of one month and call in if there are any objections.

PIL seeks directions to prevent erosion of green cover	submit its response while hearing a public interest litigation challenging the government's failure to implement the provisions of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976.The court was hearing a petition filed by Dattatraya T Devare and the Bangalore Environment Trust, who moved the court against the rampant felling of trees in the city, and have sought directions to the respective authorities to carry out their duties in accordance with the provisions of the Tree Act.The petitioners have contended that the rapid erosion of the tree cover in the city has adversely affected the health of the residents and has led to a severe degradation of the environment. This is a violation of a resident's right to clean air and environment, they said. The petitioners have submitted that the state government, BBMP, forest department and the Bangalore Urban District Tree Authority have acted in complete dereliction of the statutory duties that defeat the very purpose of the Tree act. Their inaction has contributed to the rapid erosion of the tree cover in the city, they said. The case has been adjourned by two weeks.	green cover,Bengaluru,	 Sep 11 2018
White-topping near Kadugodi Rd leaves commuters in fix	"white-topping has left citizens in a quandary as the alternative routes take much longer for them to reach their destinations.For several months now, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has been doing the white-topping between Hope Farm and Belathur via Kadugodi Road. The work has hit regular commuters, especially those headed to the IT corridor of ITPL and Whitefield, who reside in the Kadugodi ward and its vicinity.Commuters could take two alternative roads to get around the traffic jam on Kadugodi Road. One is via Seegehalli in KR Puram and another via the Hoskote highway to reach Hope Farm and other parts of the city.Commuters, however, lament that they do not serve any purpose. The first route is too narrow for cars to navigate, while the second one is very long. ""I take two hours to reach office going by the Seegehalli route,"" said Nivya Swaminathan, who resides in Kadugodi.""Since the road is too narrow — and everyone takes this route to escape the traffic jam on the Kadugodi Road — it's clogged. Without traffic, I should take just 40 minutes to reach office,"" added Nivya. No prior notice Ramya, another commuter along the route, said the white-topping began without any prior intimation. ""The delays are only adding to our misery. The traffic police seem to have no plan on how to manage the traffic here at Kadugodi Road. Commuters themselves figured out the alternative routes,"" she said.The traffic police should at least think of stopping the trucks while the white-topping work is going on as they compound the commuters' misery during the peak hours, Ramya added.A BBMP official revealed that the white-topping project was stalled due to temporary suspension of the work by the civic administration. ""It's not just in Kadugodi, but also in other places where the white-topping work was taken up,"" he added.He said half of the work has been done and the remaining will be completed soon."	traffic congestion,Kadugodi Road,white-topping,	 Sep 09 2018
Relentless locals restore Iblur Lake to pristine beauty	"onus of reviving the lake. They struggled to get the civic bodies to rejuvenate the lake and eventually succeeded in their efforts. Now, the lake is witnessing significant recovery.""The lake was under the management of the Bangalore Development Authority in 2013,"" said Naresh Sadasivan, a representative of the Iblur Lake Forum and Iblur Environs Trust. ""It was concerned about the waterbody but did very little. By then, the sewage began streaming in and the lake was getting contaminated. All this was due to the blunders made by the BBMP.""It was then that seven to eight residents formed the Iblur Lake Forum and repeatedly sent petitions to the BDA on the lake's worsening condition. ""A private party had partially encroached on the lake and there was no fencing in 2012,"" Sadasivan added. ""Also, people began dumping garbage on the lakebed.""Before the lake changed hands from the BDA to the BBMP in 2015, the former had fenced the lake in 2014 and removed encroachments after repeated petitions by the locals. With further prodding, the BBMP eventually began rejuvenating the lake in 2016.""The civic body first stopped sewage from streaming into the lake by building a diversion channel in 2017. It was de-silted three months ago and now, they are doing the bund formation,"" Sadasivan said.The lake's island is also getting a facelift, where residents are planning to plant trees, shrubs and reeds while the rains are active.""Fig, peepal, neem and Ficus glomerata (a variant of the fig tree) and other trees will be planted to attract birds,"" said another member of the Iblur Lake Forum.Those residing in apartments around the lake are also taking part in the rejuvenation activities during the weekends. ""We'll make sure no commercial activities take place near the lake,"" Sadasivan. Representatives from the BBMP will visit the lake next week to determine the planting and watering plans on the island."	rejuvenation,Iblur Lake,BDA,	 Sep 09 2018
STPs new killing fields for manual scavengers	"toilets built under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan are the new killing fields for manual scavengers, a roundtable discussion at the National Law School of India University proclaimed on Saturday. At the roundtable discussion held by the NLSIU’s Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion, manual scavengers and members of the Karnataka State Safai Karmachari Kavalu Samiti (KSSKKS) narrated how the inhuman practice is taking a toll on their lives. K B Obalesh, state convenor, KSSKKS, said most sewage treatments in Bengaluru were illegal and there were no rules in place about their cleaning and maintenance. “There have been instances of manual scavengers dying due to sheer negligence of STP owners,” he said. “The lakhs of single pit toilets built under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan are no different for manual scavengers who have to clean them with bare hands.” Citing government data, the KSSKKS said there were 202 manual scavengers in Bengaluru Urban alone and all of them had been rehabilitated through various programmes. Representatives of the Tala Samudaya Research Centre stressed the need for carrying out a comprehensive survey with adequate publicity to identify manual scavengers in the state. “We are conducting a survey and have already identified more than 30,000 manual scavengers. We don’t know what was the basis of this government survey,” a member of the research centre told DH. Data provided at the meeting showed there are at least 25,000 sewage plants in Bengaluru alone. At least 78 manual scavengers have died while at work in Karnataka since 2008; six of them died while cleaning STPs. Dr Nataraj, treasurer, KSSKKS, lamented that nobody had ever been punished for causing manual scavenging deaths. “Though 24 cases were registered over manual scavenging, there has not been a single conviction. Police are also negligent as they open a case under IPC Section 304, which refers to deaths caused by negligence.They are not aware of the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act,"" he added. Thirteen out of the 24 cases resulted in fatalities, claiming 28 lives."	Bengaluru,STP,sewage treatment plants,	 Sep 09 2018

Kaggadasapura locals on cleanup to counter BBMP dumping	garbage, residents of Kaggadasapura have decided to embark on a cleaning drive.On Saturday, they would remove garbage, and paint and beautify the area.“We want to make it look so good that it should be difficult for the civic body to dump garbage here any more,” said Tamanna Mishra, a local resident. While residents kept complaining about the garbage dumping in the area for many years, officials failed to address the issue.Chandrani Sarangi, who lives nearby, said the apathy by the civic body for many years has prompted them to undertake their own cleaning-up drive.“We’ll welcome it if the BBMP wants to have a dialogue with us. All that we want is to get the place cleaned up as it is in a bad shape for many years,” Chandrani said.Residents are at a loss to understand how the BBMP remains indifferent about the issue despite several high-ranking officials, including Mayor R Sampath Raj, visiting the place in July and directing them to clear the waste pile.

The road that remains elusive	Road, have no approach road after the Air Force closed the stretch last year citing security reasons. Members of the Navy Layout Welfare Association want the civic authorities and the local corporator to provide an alternative road to their locality. They raised the grievance at ‘Janaspandana-Citizens For Change’, a civic interactive platform organised by DH-Prajavani on Saturday. Anand Chaurasia, a resident of Navy Layout, said the locality with 10 homes had been cut off from Hesaraghatta Main Road, their gateway to the outside world. “The BBMP provided a road following several representations, but it is blocked by a BWSSB pipeline. It’s difficult to reach the main road,” he complained. Bagalkunte corporator K Narasimha Nayak conceded that the BBMP had failed to identify civic issues in the locality since it falls in Air Force area. “We failed to take notice of this locality until the last election when we learnt it comes in BBMP limits. We will surely help the residents to get a permanent approach road.” The residents also submitted a letter to Dasarahalli MLA, R Manjunatha, requesting basic facilities like streetlights, borewell and Cauvery water supply.

Students fret as BMTC switches to smart cards	provide smart cards in the place of student bus passes, school and college goers are inconvenienced as they are unable to avail the facility.Arguments between conductors insisting on full tickets and students asserting their right to travel in the concessional passes, and fellow commuters stepping in to pacify them, have become common occurrences in the buses.Schools began their academic year in the last week of May and the first week of June amidst debate over the merit of offering free bus passes.But as the BMTC introduced smart cards in the place of bus passes for the first time this year, nearly half of the eligible students commute paying for the full ticket fare.Amid the raging controversy over concessional passes, students say that getting the smartcards in the place of regular bus passes is an arduous task.“We applied for the bus pass, but are yet to avail the smart card. We’re asked to show our acknowledgement, receipt and ID card as proof,” said Shivani, one of the students.On Saturday, a conductor on board a bus to Mayo hall from Corporation circle was involved in a heated argument with students on the bus pass issue. The conductor said they are not instructed to accept acknowledgement in the place of a bus pass.Top BMTC officials acknowledged the delay in issuing the passes due to the delay in switching to smart cards. “There’s no issue with other transport companies. Even the KSRTC has dispensed with the applications. The delay is only with the BMTC,” said an official.The BMTC received 2.4 lakh applications for bus passes this year, out of which 1.05 lakh passes have been issued.The official concerned said there is no short supply of smart cards. “This is the first time we are giving smart cards. Previously, students had to come to designated centres and submit details and documents. Now it has been made available online,” said the official.He attributed the delay to students and institutions providing incorrect information, due to which forms had to be sent back for correction.

E-buses to start plying on Bengaluru roads in October	city’s roads as Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is set to acquire them in about a month’s time.Olectra Greentech Ltd said on Wednesday that it is ready to supply electric buses to BMTC. The company is waiting for BMTC to hand over dedicated space for setting up charging stations at selected depots in the city, a top company official said.“BMTC has placed an order for 80 buses (60 A/C and 20 non-A/C buses) and we are ready to supply them. Once BMTC gives us space, we will set up charging stations, which are essential for commencing operations,” N K Rawal, managing director, Olectra Greentech told DH.He said the company requires about four weeks to complete the work on charging stations before BMTC commences operations of electric buses. The 12-metre-long A/C bus can seat 39, including a wheelchair occupant. It can travel up to 250 km on a single charge of five hours. The operating cost of these buses is around Rs 6-7 per km.Olectra Greetech (formerly Goldstone Infratech Ltd) manufactures electric buses in technical collaboration with Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd. It has set up a plant in Hyderabad to assemble electric buses.BMTC has received incentives from the Union government under Phase-1 of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) scheme. The government of India introduced Phase-1 of FAME in 2015 in a bid to promote eco-friendly mobility and offered incentives to state governments to purchase buses. Under the scheme, BMTC had planned to introduce 150 electric buses.In 2014, BMTC had conducted a trial run of electric buses supplied by BYD-Greentech and had shown interest in commercial operations.Rawal said that in all probability, BMTC could start operating electric buses in Bengaluru in October. The company has also bagged orders from Mumbai and Hyderabad transport undertakings. Mumbai is already running buses in Colaba and Hyderabad is likely to start operations in September.Olectra is also talking to various other state transport undertakings to supply buses under Phase-2 of FAME scheme. The company is also in talks with several private sector tour operators, schools and corporates to supply electric buses. It manufactures electric buses in 7, 9 and 12-metre variants.Olectra plans to set up a new manufacturing facility in Hyderabad spread over 250 acres. It plans to invest Rs 200 crore on the plant, which can make 2,000 buses a year.	Bengaluru,BMTC,e-buses,	 Aug 29 2018
Hackathon aims to crack city's waste water puzzle	to a slew of criticism.At a time when the city is battling a water crisis and witnessing a crying need for wastewater management, a team of experts hopes to brainstorm an idea to address the issues.A four-day hackathon is being organised by the Waste Impact Trust in partnership with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), United Way and others. The event, to be conducted at the IISc between September 1-2 and September 8-9, will identify low-cost, high-impact, inclusive solutions to the problem of water waste in Bengaluru. Fish deaths reported in Sankey, Lalbagh, Jakkur and Munnekolala lakes; frothing of Bellandur, Maragondanahalli, Rampura, Sarakki and Varthur lakes and an incident of fire in the Bellandur Lake have only marred the city’s reputation further, believe experts. People from economically weak and marginalised communities will participate along with the best talents of the country. The best solutions emerging from the hackathon will be incubated, implemented on the ground and scaled.Experts from IISc, entrepreneurs, technologists and waste management experts will sit together and discuss Bengaluru’s challenges of drinking water shortage and sewage. In the first phase of the event, ideas on issues that are to be addressed will be discussed. Following this, sustainable solutions will be designed and projects developed.A prize worth Rs 2 lakh will be given for developing the best idea coming out of the hackathon. A 45-day challenge will be open to all registered participants to showcase progress in their idea for a chance of incubation. The teams will be offered advice and coaching on developing a business canvas, building a business pitch and a business plan.The hackathon looks at creating profitable ventures. Gayitri Handanahal, managing trustee, Waste Impact Trust, said the hackathon starts by looking at the problems. “This includes a focus on lakes, STPs and other issues. This is a livelihood-focused hackathon. For instance, we will look at how people are cleaning lakes, and how it can be done,” she said.	waste management,Bengaluru,	 Aug 29 2018
Network connectivity issues at KIA	"in a twister of network connectivity issues over the past four days, disrupting cargo services and critical communication channels. Flight operations were, however, not affected until late Tuesday evening. Although the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) said passengers were not inconvenienced, the airport website was reportedly down for hours before it was restored. The airport's Twitter account had to tweet a passenger advisory that directed queries and requests for help to its call and WhatsApp numbers (9538882209/8884998888). A BIAL spokesperson attributed the problems to fluctuating connectivity of the airport's internal Wi-fi systems. ""Our IT Department is working to restore the services. Since the network has been fluctuating, we have supplied our partners with internet dongles and SIMs,"" the spokesperson said. The disruption in the airport's phone lines sparked big problems for critical internal communications. Until Tuesday night, it was not immediately known what caused the problems. The spokesperson, however, said issues would be resolved at the earliest. The Wi-fi connectivity problems forced some passengers to approach the airport officials, who could not immediately respond. A traveller, Apoorv Badami, tweeted wondering what the problem was. ""A lot of people are inconvenienced. So what is the workaround? Backup?"" Another passenger had this to tweet: ""Bangalore is world's software capital, yet the airport can't provide decent WiFi. How do foreigners without an Indian phone get a OTP? Change the WiFi access system. Simplify it."" Airport sources indicated that the technical issues were with the internal servers. At one point, even the official emails were not going through. The web check-in facilities were also affected, causing problems for passengers who frequently used them. This system was unavailable for a day, the sources said. The delay in resolving the network issues forced many sections within the airport to switch to manual mode. The sources said the services of at least one flight was partially affected. However, this could not be confirmed. On July 31, a glitch in the computer systems had briefly affected operations at the Mumbai Domestic and International Airport. All operations had been halted at both the T1 and T2 terminals of the airport."	wifi,flights,KIA,network,cargo,	 Aug 28 2018
BWSSB delays work, Dasarahalli roads in mess	"in MHR, MEI, Kirloskar and AGB layouts in Dasarahalli zone find it harder to navigate the roads.The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewage Corporation (BWSSB) dug up these roads to lay Cauvery water connections to the layouts, but it did not restore them. The lose mud has now turned slushy as a result of the rains. “A car can get stuck in the debris, while riding bikes here is a nightmare,” said an indignant Ravindra Nayak, a resident of MHR Layout.Residents also complain that the BWSSB did not bother to finish the pipe-laying in the residential roads.Prakash from AGB Layout said the dust floating around makes walking through the stretches a challenge. “How can one breathe in this condition?” he asked.Umadevi, a senior citizen who lives in the area for more than 15 years, said the mess reveals the lack of coordination between the civic agencies.""There has to be some coordination and accountability on the part of the civic agencies to finish the work soon. Water scarcity is the biggest problem in this area, but digging up and not repairing it or completing the road work has become the biggest problem,” she said, adding that the dust emanating from the debris enters homes and settles on everything.A BBMP official said it would take a few more days for the BWSSB to complete the pipe-laying work. “they’d hand over the roads to the BBMP after the work is over,” he said. “We’ll then restore the roads.”"	Roads,Dasarahalli zone,BWSSB,	 Aug 28 2018
Mahadevapura roads strewn with rubble	storm, but in reality the sand and dust on the roads of Mahadevapura is the result of intense construction activity.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has done very little to deal with the problem here. Residents complain that the BBMP is not cleaning up the arterial roads and streets, resulting in air pollution and flooding during the rains.They are also indignant over the BBMP’s apathy towards unauthorised dumping of C&D debris on the roadside, pavements and medians by various agencies. All it takes, they said, is the mechanised street cleaning.“The BBMP has deployed just one mechanised sweeper for the whole of Mahadevapura and cleans five or six arterial roads just once a month,” said Clement Jayakumar, a resident of Doddanekundi.The mechanised sweeper is unable to cover the stretch of ORR from Lowry Junction till Iblur, a heavy traffic area that has more sand and silt on the roadside, Jayakumar said. “We need at least one sweeper per ward since the construction activities are increasing,” he added.Residents complain that the authorities are only pointing fingers at each other rather than clearing the mess. “BBMP’s solid waste management department says it is the job of the engineering department as this’d be additional garbage, while the local ward engineers say they don’t even have a contract to remove sand on a regular basis,” lamented one Whitefield resident.BBMP Superintendent Engineer Nataraj said they have proposed an additional mechanised sweeper four days ago. “We just had one with which we cleaned dust and silt from the major roads. We’ll have an action plan once the other machine arrives,” he said. “ITPL, Sarjapur and KR Puram.”Nataraj also said the civic body is clearing the dust due to vehicular movement. “We will set up a separate dumping site for construction debris that will effectuate the mechanized cleaning. If two sweepers are not enough, we’ll ask for one more,” he assured.	road repair,Mahadevapura,BBMP,	 Aug 28 2018
Rising intolerance towards wildlife	around Bandipur Tiger Reserve is due to economic issues, revealed a recent study by scientists.According to the report 'The production of human-wildlife conflict: A political geography of encounter', there is little conflict because of tolerance towards wildlife and lifestyle changes.Authors, Jared D Margulies, from University of Sheffield, UK and Krithi K Karanth from Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS), state that local economics like the rise in coffee prices, exclusionary state approach prohibiting grazing in protected areas and shift from the low cost of traditional livestock to expensive hybrid cattle has resulted in the declining tolerance for wildlife.The research was conducted from 2015 to 2016 and relied on interviews with families living around Bandipur, veterinarians, animal husbandry experts and Karnataka forest department staff. Secondary data including livestock and human census data was also accounted.The study found the declining level of tolerance towards carnivores among agricultural communities near Bandipur had little to do with lifestyle or cultural changes in communities as claimed.Foundational changes taking place in rural livestock economy are creating new sites of encounters between humans and carnivores, often very close to human habitation. This, in turn, is reducing the communities’ tolerance towards carnivores.“Our research findings demonstrate the need to go beyond popular and often misleading narratives to identify and understand the various and complex social, political and economic linkages that often underlie human-carnivore interactions,” Krithi said.A more nuanced understanding of sources of human-wildlife conflict — in this case, the economic decision making of rural agrarian families — is indispensable for designing effective solutions that address conflicts between humans and carnivores in co-shared and contested landscapes. The study thus offers a valuable approach to employ the deeper inquiry required and contributes to the growing interdisciplinary field of human-wildlife interactions, she added.

HC seeks BMTC response on Volvo passes 	Corporation (BMTC) to submit its response while hearing a petition challenging a circular issued by the BMTC that states that free passes for Volvo buses will no longer be granted to persons suffering from blindness.A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari was hearing a public interest litigation filed by the National Federation of the Blind that moved the court seeking directions to the authorities to issue a fresh circular granting the facility of free bus passes to persons suffering from complete blindness for all buses in the state including the Vajra ( Volvo) buses.The petitioner contended that the circular is contrary to the policy instituted by the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation wherein several types of free bus passes had been made available for persons suffering from blindness in Karnataka.Furthermore, a corrigendum was issued that stated that people with a locomotor disability having disability concession passes and blind pass holders holding the free blind pass and having total blindness are given the opportunity for travelling in Vajra buses.The petitioner stated that the decision of the BMTC to withdraw the facility of a free bus pass for persons with disabilities without any valid reason is arbitrary in nature.The petitioner further contended that Section 41 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act states that the government shall develop schemes to promote the mobility of persons with disabilities at an affordable cost and should provide incentives and concessions.The concession for issuing free bus passes to persons with total visual impairment was made under the section and thus there is no rationale to withdraw the facility for Volvo buses.The petitioner also sought the facility of free bus passes to be extended to persons suffering from at least 40% blindness and benchmark disabilities.	volvos,visually impaired,HC,BMTC,free passes,	 Aug 28 2018
Single firm in the race to build 8 new skywalks	activists over building skywalks at places where they are not needed, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahangara Palike (BBMP) plans to construct eight new footbridges in various parts of the city. But more than the plan of building new skywalks, what may invite criticism is the fact that a single firm bid for all the projects in public-private partnership, a source in the BBMP told DH. Hyderabad-based Syed Iftequar Mehdi (M/s Ad Age Outdoor Advertising Pvt Ltd) is the only bidder for the project which has been sent to the BBMP council for approval. Padmanabha Reddy, the opposition leader in the BBMP council, said: “Building a skywalk is a sheer waste of money. In reality, no one uses skywalks. We will oppose the projects at the meeting on Tuesday.” When asked how could only one company bid for the project, Reddy said: “This aspect requires attention and we need to look into its details. If the company fulfils all the tender conditions, the BBMP can consider awarding the project to it. We will seek a clarification from the mayor on this.” Mayor R Sampath Raj said the project’s fate would be decided only after a detailed discussion in the council. “We will listen to what corporators have to say, and accordingly, we will take a call on the project,” he said.	skywalks,BBMP,	 Aug 28 2018

Cauvery water supply to 3 of 110 villages put off	of the 110 villages making up greater Bengaluru was cancelled on August 17 due to the demise of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) officials said Uttarahalli, Sonenahalli and Ganakallu were the first of the 110 villages to receive Cauvery water from the Board, but the launch was cancelled since the state declared a seven day mourning period for Vajpayee’s demise.The Board has already installed water meters and issued RR numbers to 688 residents from Mahadevapura, Rajarajeshwarinagara, Dasarahalli, Bytarayanapura and Bommanahalli zones who have paid their beneficiary capital contribution (BCC) charges for new water connection.The Board was to supply water to 7 villages including Horamavu, Siddapura, Ramagondanahalli and Herohalli. BWSSB is now planning to schedule the launch by next week provided the local MLA gives them a date for the event.However, another official said hydro-testing of the new pipelines is still going on and it would take another week to completely verify the pipelines before regular water supply could be resumed. BWSSB is laying pipelines in 110 villages in phases and has asked the residents to pay their BCC to obtain legal water connection.	Cauvery water,BWSSB,	 Aug 27 2018
Garbage piles in Dasarahalli a potential health risk 	a serious problem.Piles of solid waste lying around at every corner makes the place look dirtier, complain residents.An industrial suburb comprising the Peenya Industrial Estate –said to be Asia’s largest- Dasarahalli also has small clusters of residential areas.Garbage black spots in the area have no regular cleaning, making parks, graveyards and playgrounds in places like Bagalagunte, MEI Layout, MHR layout and Mallasandra appear a veritable waste dumps.Residents say the garbage includes industrial plastic, rubber and other inorganic substances which are burnt across various black spots.Mahadevappa, a senior citizen who lives in Chokkasandra, said asthma and other respiratory ailments–caused by burning of plastic- are becoming common in the area. “Some of them burn the garbage early in the morning and it’s too uncomfortable to smoke until afternoon,” he said.Those living in AGB Layout and Chikkabanavara are alarmed by the rise in pig population, a potential health hazard. “Several of these street pigs are found in garbage black spots. We’ve made several complaints to the BBMP but no use,” said Satyanarayana, a resident of AGB Layout.Govindaraju, a member of MHR Layout residents welfare association said: “The door-to-door waste collection is not happening regularly. The autos collecting garbage are unseen most of the times. Students, who live in larger numbers here, throw the waste on the streets that increases the street dog population.”A BBMP official said the civic body is regularly clearing the waste from the black spots. “We’ve also installed CCTV cameras to prevent illegal dumping of waste,” he added.People coming to eat in Indira Canteen at Mallasandra have to put up with the foul odor drifting in from the garbage black spot just 10 metres away. “It’s horrible to have breakfast at this canteen,” said Prasanna, an auto driver. “Auto tippers come here in the morning to dump the garbage that only makes it worse.”	Dasarahalli,Garbage,	 Aug 27 2018
No free entry to kids' park in Jayanagar	"privatisation of parks in the city by charging an entry fee. Each visitor to the Nandanavana Children's Park in Jayanagar 4th 'T' Block in southern Bengaluru has to pay Rs 5. The park has play equipment and is open only in the evening. The BBMP recently invited tenders for ""running, supervision, operation and maintenance"" of the park. But the entry fee is nothing new and has been collected for about four years now, said former corporator C K Ramamurthy. ""The entry fee is nominal and does not burden people,"" he said. ""The park was designed along the lines of the Hong Kong Disneyland. Sometimes, songs are played here for birthdays and the equipment is painted every six months."" Curiously, there is no fee to visit several large parks that incur high maintenances costs. JP Park in Mathikere, MN Krishna Rao Park in Basavanagudi and Freedom Park on Seshadri Road incur huge maintenance costs. Freedom Park alone runs up an annual bill of Rs 1 crore. A senior BBMP official had this to say when asked about the need to charge people for visiting public places: ""I don't think it's right to compare a children's park with other parks such as Krishna Rao Park. The requirement and maintenance work are different here (in the Nandanavana Park). The expenditure is more because we have to remove fallen leaves and beautify the place. The Nandanavana park is a high-tech one and the focus is on maintaining the play equipment."" Gangadhar Swamy S, a deputy director in the BBMP's Horticulture Department, said maintenance costs in the Nandanavana Park were high because security guards work three shifts. ""We need round-the-clock security in this huge park,"" he said. Bahubali Raju, of Jayanagar 5th block Resident Welfare Association, said the entry fee was not an issue as it was nominal. ""They need money for maintenance. It's not wrong to charge visitors,"" he said."	BBMP,Jayanagar park,	 Aug 26 2018
BBMP lays Channasandra-Thirumalashettyhalli road	"BBMP has finally restored the Channasandra-Thirumalashettyhalli road in East Bengaluru.The 1.5-kilometre long road was dug up to lay pipes for the KC Valley project, which resulted in crater-size potholes that made commuting on that stretch a nightmare for the citizens.The road straddling Kadugodi ward and Hoskote taluk is a crucial link for 20 to 30 villages in the area to Whitefield, Kadugodi and the rest of the city.Residents, who accused the authorities of taking only temporary measures and not laying the road fully, are breathing easy as the condition of the road has been improving over the past 20 days.""This is an excellent road as it is three to four inches thicker,"" said Kumar K, a resident of Kadugodi. ""A month ago, the BBMP laid the road in just two days and it was damaged in a few days' time. After that, we urged the BBMP to lay a better road and we never expected it to be so good.""Residents are asking the BBMP to lay speed breakers as soon as possible since the heavy vehicles are zooming at a high speed. ""We have also asked the BBMP to install street lights throughout the stretch,"" added another resident.A BBMP official said the civic body is carrying out asphalting and drainage works simultaneously. ""We will finish the entire work by September,"" the official assured.The residents are planning a thanksgiving party for MLA Arvind Limbavali, the corporator and other BBMP officials as soon as the work is completed."

BBMP forms teams to inspect valleys	last year, the BBMP has formed three teams to check the problems around four valleys surrounding the city.Mayor R Sampath Raj held a meeting with the stormwater drains (SWD) engineers on Thursday and suggested to rope in more officers to inspect problems near the valleys so that measures could be taken to prevent waterlogging problems.The teams will look after four valleys — Koramangala, Challaghatta and Vrishabhavathi valley and Hebbal valley — and surrounding three km area from the valley, to find any obstructions, encroachments or problems and resolve them immediately.“A supervisor will head the teams and we will see to it that the rainwater flows through the designated routes without any obstruction and try to avoid the waterlogging situation,” said Bettegowda, chief engineer, stormwater drain, BBMP.Meanwhile, Chief Secretary T M Vijaybhaskar has ordered the BBMP to appoint additional officers across all eight zones to solve civic problems.These officers are entrusted with responsibilities that include, an inspection of the zone once in a month, to identify problems in respective zones and inform the concerned officer, to hold a meeting of all BBMP, BWSSB, BESCOM, PWD, police officers in the zone once a month, and report these issues to the chief secretary.	valleys,BBMP,	 Aug 24 2018
OFCs leave roads in a mess at Whitefield 	of hiccups, but the bane of their lives is optical fibre cable (OFC) service providers digging up roads, despite the BBMP’s blanket ban.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has swung into action against OFC service providers digging up roads without prior permission, but the problem persists in many areas of Mahadevapura, especially in Whitefield in the East Bengaluru region.Here, the residents wake up to dug-up roads that looked normal the previous day. Now, they are clueless about how to chart their future path.The EPIP zone in Whitefield is one such area that has borne the OFC brunt. “Four days ago, when digging began on one of the roads, I reported the matter immediately to the BBMP. After the Palike officials interfered, the OFC contractor cleared the area. But the activity resumed the following day at the same spot. They finished the work and left the damaged road as it is,” said Akshay Kumar, a corporate professional in the area.In a similar incident, the residents of one of the areas in Hagadur ward alerted the BBMP when illegal cable-digging was going on at midnight. The spot was cleared immediately.“The roads that we see one day do not remain the same. The contractors get them dug up during the night. When we demand the permission letter, they don’t produce it. They merely claim they have the required permission,” a resident of Hagadur said.Similar cases were reported from Seegehalli near KR Puram, Dinnur near Hebbal, Kundanahalli road, Marathahalli main road and other parts of Whitefield.BBMP chief engineer G Parameshwariah said: “Heavy penalties will be imposed by the government on those laying cables or digging roads without permission. We are attending to all the cases that are reported to us. It is difficult to fix accountability on unauthorised contractors. The BBMP officials have been asked to verify the authenticity of the contractors.”	OFC,Whitefield,BBMP,	 Aug 24 2018
Rock delays Muthuraj junction underpass 	plight of commuters on the outer ring road, especially near Hosakerehalli junction, as work on the Muthuraj junction underpass is getting delayed.Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is building a signal-free corridor from Mysuru Road junction to Central Silk Board junction crossing five intersections under the Nagarothana project. The Muthuraj junction, which is one such intersection, is a bi-directional underpass, is getting delayed due to the presence of a huge rock.The hard rock is being excavated using the controlled blast method. “This method uses rubber so that when there is an explosion, there is no danger of flying debris from the rock,” said K T Nagaraj, chief engineer, road infrastructure projects, BBMP. This consumes a lot of time, he said.Though the project was conceived in 2015 and was expected to be completed by the end of October this year, it may be ready only by the end of March, 2019.“It was only four months ago that the traffic police have given us traffic clearance, though we sought an approval last June.Now, we have shifted all utilities like power lines and BWSSB pipes. Also, Bescom’s overhead lines have been replaced by underground cables,” Nagaraj explained.Kathriguppe ward corporator M Venkatesh said they don’t want to inconvenience commuters anymore and added that work is now gathering pace. “Besides adopting controlled blasts, we are also using excavators to speed up work,” he said.Mayor R Sampath Raj, who inspected the site with engineers and MLA Ravi Subramanya said that 25% of the work is over and the remaining will be completed soon.

Vizag follows Bengaluru in adopting TenderSURE roads	"to go the Bengaluru way to develop TenderSURE roads.The port city, known famously as the Jewel of East Coast, is taking Bengaluru's TenderSURE model as a case study to solve the pothole menace on the roads.The TenderSURE model provides separate ducts along the streets to lay water, power, sanitary lines and also gas pipelines. This would prevent the road from being dug frequently and improve its durability.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has implemented the TenderSURE model in St Mark's Road, Residency Road, Church Street and Museum Road.The Greater Visakhapatnam Smart City Corporation Limited (GVSCCL) has done a detailed study on the issues concerning roads and how they can be solved. The problems include lack of space for the physically challenged, unequal lane distribution, priority for speeding vehicles over pedestrian safety and inaccessible footpaths.The proposed model includes reduction of lane widths from 3.5m to 3.2m to provide more space for pedestrians, separate ducts for utilities, and street furniture, among others. Swati Ramanathan, founder of Janaagraha, a non-government organisation that is associated with urban local corporations to develop the TenderSURE model said: ""The Ministry of Urban Development has introduced TenderSURE as the best practice for municipal projects spearheading under 'Smart Roads'."" Cities like Davanagere and Nagpur are also including the model keeping Bengaluru as the case study since the project was first implemented here.Speaking about the project, a senior BBMP official said: ""The condition of the roads were deteriorating earlier as they were dug up multiple times either to lay power lines or cables or to repair water pipes. The TenderSURE model solves these issues.""K T Nagaraj, BBMP chief engineer, road infrastructure projects, said no one came for consultation from Visakhapatnam.Vishal Kundra from GVSCCL told Deccan Herald that Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu initiated the foundation-laying ceremony for the Smart City project on Thursday, and this would be a good start for the improvement of infrastructural facilities in the state."

A group of 40 active citizens, part of the project, will come up with a pilot project to utilise the funds to curb the mounting garbage problem.Manivannan refused to disclose details about the grant, saying it was too early to speak about it. The senior IAS officer, who is in the US at the moment, said the university has vacations till September 4 and once it reopens, he will be in a better position to talk about it.Sridhar Pabbisetty, an activist, and G R Chandran, e-governance consultant, are part of the citizen group that would come up with a project to ensure that the funds are efficiently used.According to Pabbisetty, Bengaluru has been facing issues with garbage for some time, and despite numerous plans and methods, it has not been implemented. ""Mysuru has successfully installed GPS in all their garbage trucks, but here it has not been effectively implemented. We need to address the whole indiscipline in the system,"" he added.Similarly, Chandran said the project will have to be approved by the university before the grants start rolling out.

Lack of shelters bothers citizens along Hesaraghatta Rd	Hesaraghatta Main Road has greatly inconvenienced citizens using public transport.From five kilometres till Chikkabanavara, they have to wait for the bus under the scorching sun and during heavy rain. Bagalagunte, Bone Mill, Sapthagiri College, AGB Layout and Widia School are among the stops without a shelter.“We are at a danger of being mowed down by speeding vehicles,” said Pavan Kumar, a resident of Bagalagunte, noting that the hazard of waiting on the roadside for buses has been continuing for several years now, with no official bothering to put up a shelter.Susheela, a senior citizen residing in AGB Layout, said BMTC buses never stop at the designated spots due to lack of shelters. “Drivers of mofussil buses from Hesaraghatta are very rash,” she noted.Commuters want shelters to be put up at this stretch with seating facilities for the elderly citizens, students and women. Lack of shelters also affects students who have to board and alight the buses at various points.What BBMP says...BBMP chief engineer, Dasarahalli zone, Vijayakumar N said there was a proposal to widen the road, which did not happen.“If the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) comes up with a proposal, we are ready to put up shelters under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode,” he said.

Demand to convert CA sites into playgrounds on the rise	"amenity (CA) sites belonging to the Bangalore Development Authority to fund many schemes, the demand to convert them into playgrounds and parks is on the rise. This comes in the wake of a shortage of open spaces in the city.According to citizens and urban experts, instead of auctioning the CA sites, where the lease has expired, the government should convert them into parks and playgrounds.However, the BDA said citizens should help to maintain the parks and playgrounds.The BDA officials said the auctioning of the CA sites was proposed due to financial crisis. Converting them into open spaces and handing it over to the BBMP would not attract any finances.According to the BBMP records, there are 289 playgrounds and 1,299 parks of varied dimensions in the city. Further, the BDA's Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP)-2031 has earmarked only 4% for open spaces.The demand for playgrounds and parks also gained momentum after residents from Indiranagar and north Bengaluru recently voiced their opinion on the need for open spaces.Children at a loss""There is a shortage of playgrounds in the city. The government should think about the welfare of people, especially children. Since there is a lack of playgrounds, many children are forced to play on the streets,"" said Subhash B, a citizen.The recent report by the Centre for Ecological Sciences, IISc-Trees of Bengaluru, stated that concretisation has increased by 925% in Bengaluru from 1973- 2014. The city has lost 78% of its vegetation and open spaces.Urban planner V Ravichandar said there is a decline in the designated open spaces. The CDP shows that there is a deduction by 25% in the CDP in the past 25 years. The city needs more lung space and what better than parks and playgrounds, which have multiple objectives. The government cannot think of monetary gains always, he said.Noted urban planner Kodandapani, who drafted a few CDPs in the past, said the rules of 1976 of setting aside 15% space for parks and playgrounds and 10% for civic amenity sites have been long forgotten.All open spaces are being encroached and concretised as the value of land is very high. But the city needs more open spaces, especially in private layouts and developing areas, he added.BDA Commissioner Rakesh Singh said they would place the citizens 'suggestions before the government for consideration."

BBMP can't relax till city is free of flexes, says HC	"Justice Dinesh Maheshwari made this oral observation while hearing a petition, seeking directions for the removal of flexes and hoardings across the city.The counsel for the Palike submitted to the high court that it has received 1,192 responses along with documents with regard to the public notice and that the BBMP would examine the claims of having obtained permission for putting up advertisement hoardings.Responding to a question on how many cases pertaining to flexes and hoardings were pending in the courts, the counsel submitted that 112 petitions were pending before the high court, of which an interim order of stay has been granted in 44 cases. The counsel said 90 cases were pending in the civil court and an interim order has been granted in 26.The court was also informed that some hoardings continue to exist in areas beyond the BBMP limits, which come under different gram panchayats. The court said such gram panchayats would also be made a party in the petition.Status of the offendersWhile seeking to know the status of the bail applications and proceedings with regard to offences under the Karnataka Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act, 1981, the advocate general said 47 people have pleaded guilty till date.When the court sought to know the antecedents of those arrested, the advocate general replied that such people were not serial offenders or criminals and hence, no records were maintained. He added that records of antecedents are diligently maintained for criminals and serial offenders.On the court's suggestions, the advocate general promised to take steps to maintain a database of people booked for installation for illegal hoardings.The court also stated that by August-end the matter has to be concluded.It orally observed that at present, the mission of making the city free of flexes and hoardings was being accomplished by and large. ""If things are in control, then this is only the beginning. The ultimate aim is to restore the city back to its original glory,"" the court said.The court stated that the drive for removing flexes and hoardings should be extended to the whole state, and adjourned the case to August 31."

So far, the BDA has slapped notices to 70 CA site lease-holders (a copy of which is with DH).In the notice, the BDA has asked the lease-holders to pay the amount at the earliest failing which the BDA will initiate the process of recovering the sites in keeping with the BDA rules.The list of lease-holders whose licences have lapsed includes 25 government institutions like eight police stations, three belonging to the Department of Public Libraries, two each with the postal department, telephone exchange and Bengaluru University. The list also includes private institutions like 15 educational institutions, 12 religious establishments, private offices, choultries, nursing homes and hospitals and parks. The list also includes petrol bunks. These lease agreements were issued from 1962 to 1995. The sites of varied dimensions were allotted across the city.“We have been repeatedly serving notices to CA site holders to renew their lease agreement, but the response has been poor. According to BDA rules, if the lease tenure lapses, then the BDA is entitled to recover the sites. So far, we have not recovered any sites, but now we have decided to do so,” a senior BDA official said.Lease format revisedBDA allots sites under the Allotment Rules of CA Sites of 1989, which has a provision to recover sites where the lease agreement has lapsed. To generate earnings, the BDA had revised the lease format from 99 years to 30 years. But now, this has also become a challenge before the BDA and the state government.“Rules state that we can recover the sites after slapping three notices. But under political pressure and as a social obligation, we have been unable to do so. Many lease-holders assert that the renewal cost is too high,” the official said.The BDA, in 2016, had revised the renewal cost from 2011. The renewal rates were hiked by Rs 400-Rs 1,000 for different sectors, along with guidance value ranging from 2%-10% per square metre.12- Religious institutions8- police stations15- Educational institutions3- libraries5- medical institutions15 – Trusts, choultries, associations and committees	BDA,Civic amenity site,	 Aug 21 2018

Work on Baiyappanahalli rail overbridge resumes	(ROB) resumed on Thursday.Bengaluru Central MP P C Mohan performed groundbreaking ceremony along with CV Raman Nagar MLA S Raghu and SWR officials. Assistant Railway Divisional Manager G K Jalan was present.“As promised, the work on the Baiyapanahalli ROB began today. It will be ready for the public use in 12 months,” P C Mohan said.He said he would take up the issues of delayed suburban rail project with the Centre, and promised to follow up the progress of the project so as to ensure that it would be completed in the stipulated time.The project that was on hold since 2012 costs Rs 10 crore. It is the first of 12 projects to be built after the then Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman transferred 55,000 square metres of defence land on March 6 to Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy.The project has been taken up to connect the proposed third coaching terminal at Baiyapanahalli and Swami Vivekananda Metro Station.The 900-metre road will connect areas like Old Baiyapanahalli and Maruthi Sevanagar to Old Madras Road, making it easier for Bengaluru-Chennai commuters. About 400 metres of the road was already constructed when there was a delay in getting the Army’s Madras Engineer Group permission for the commencement of the work.	Baiyappanahalli,	 Jun 14 2019

Litterbugs beware, marshals will fine you	problem of blackspots in the city, the state government has approved the appointment of garbage marshals.Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had in 2018 sent a proposal for the appointment of 240 retired servicemen as marshals to prevent garbage dumping in the city.BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad told DH, “The approval has come from the government and we will appoint about 240 marshals in a month and each marshal will be responsible for preventing garbage dumping in his respective ward.”Marshals will be appointed through the Karnataka Ex-servicemen Welfare Society (KEWS). BBMP will deploy 198 marshals every day and the remaining 42 will be on standby. They will work in wards when the regular marshal is off or on leave.The marshals will be hired under the special concession from the government under 4(G) exemption approved by the Urban Development Department. BBMP will spend Rs 8.48 crore on salaries, uniforms and training these marshals every year.D Randeep, additional commissioner, Solid Waste Management, BBMP, told DH, “This will be a remarkable development in the city as it will put an end to the menace of blackspots (garbage dumping spots). Marshals will be tasked with penalising people dumping garbage in public places,” he said.An amendment will be soon made to the Karnataka Municipal Council (KMC) Act to bestow the power of enforcement on marshals. “An amendment will be made to the KMC Act through the BBMP Council to empower marshals. They will be able to penalise those caught dumping garbage in public places. They will have GPS-enabled personalised digital assistants to issue receipts for the penalty amount to ensure transparency and accountability,” he said.The decision was one of the 10 listed in the Citizen Charter presented to the state government after an interactive event organised by DH/PV as part of DH & Citizens for Civic Amenities forum in the first week of October 2018.BBMP has appointed marshals for Bellahalli landfill, Bellandur and Varthur lakes.

BMTC student pass rate hiked by Rs 250	Rs 100 to Rs 250 for school, college and professional college students of general category. The price for renewing the pass has also been hiked by Rs 100 to Rs 220.Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) on Thursday issued new rates for bus passes for the coming academic year, effecting hikes for all students except to those going to primary schools who will continue to pay Rs 200 for the annual pass.Pre-university students will pay Rs 1,250 instead of Rs 1,100. High school boys and girls, who pay different rates, will shell out Rs 100 more.The hike is the highest for students in professional colleges who will pay an additional Rs 250. The pass for technical and medical college students has been hiked by Rs 240 and that of evening college/PhD students by Rs 200.The price for renewal of passes is similar except for a difference of Rs 30 charged for issuing the new smart card. SC/ST students have been exempted from the hike.Officials said they have opened the portal for online applications at mybmtc.karnataka.gov.in, where a list of pass issuing counters is also available. Students of primary, middle, high school and PUC can apply for a new bus pass or renew their passes, the corporation said in a release.For degree, professional, technical and medical college students, the corporation will soon announce the method for applying and collecting passes, the release said.Students vowed to protest against the move till the government rolled back the hike. “Last week, we heard from the chief minister that there will be no hike in bus pass rates. We took his word and withdrew the protest. But now, we know that we were betrayed. A state-wide stir will be launched to protest against this anti-student move,” said Roshan L, Bengaluru district secretary of AIDSO.An official in the government, however, said, “The state government will pay 50% of the expenditure while the student and the RTC bear 25% each. However, the cost of operations has doubled over the last six years. The hike bridges only a fraction of the gap,” he said.	BMTC,	 Jun 14 2019
Mayor takes stock of underpass work in Kundalahalli	"task over the slow pace of underpass work in Kundalahalli junction.Gangambike inspected Kundalahalli junction, where the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike is carrying out the work on an underpass as part of 17-km-long signal-free corridor along the Old Airport Road.She directed officials to speed up the work in order to complete the underpass construction by December this year.Speaking to the public who had complained to her about the slow pace of work, she said: ""Due to the land acquisition of 21 properties, the work got delayed. The BBMP will develop underpass, pedestrian path and service road in the junction, which is time-consuming. However, the work will be completed in a few months,"" she told.Later, the mayor visited Wind Tunnel junction to inspect the ongoing underpass work and directed officials to complete the work soon as the traffic in the area was affected due to the work.Shwetha Vijay Kumar, Kundalahalli corporator, complained to the mayor that the work got delayed due to BBMP officials' negligence, but they were being questioned."

One toilet for 60-plus workers at construction site	for the residents of Mahadevapura. But what has caused distress to them is the way the contract labourers working for it are being treated — with little or no basic hygiene.There is just one mobile toilet for more than 60 labourers engaged in construction activities at the site. This doesn’t even spare ladies. All are necessitated to use one single mobile toilet, which is locked half of the day. This has forced the labourers to use the available open spaces to answer nature’s calls, which residents think is a serious health hazard to them.The resident activists had approached the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) three months ago seeking the provision of at least three mobile toilets for the workers. But to their surprise, there is only one now. “There are no public toilets around the site at least for the ladies to use. If all the 60 workers use the same toilet, imagine the effect on their health,” said Anjali Saini, a citizen volunteer.“We, as citizen volunteers have been pressing for basic hygiene since the time the project started. After so much pressure, we sought approval for three toilets. Now when inspected, we found just one, and that too locked at 12 noon. I think we as a citizen group are also taken for a ride,” she added.The volunteers argued that according to law, the BBMP contractors “should” provide basic hygiene to the labourers at the site.However, the BBMP officials sound quite irresponsible about the situation. “The labour sheds are in Jigani, where the workers stay temporarily. They are not using the mobile toilet at the construction site much as they come finishing everything. But considering the health hazards, we have requested the higher authorities to approve two toilets for ladies and gents each. These may appear in the next two weeks at the site,” said a BBMP official, who wished to remain anonymous.He added: “In fact, the toilet is mostly used by ladies. Despite educating men not to use open spaces to answer their nature calls, they still continue to do so. But we are glad at least ladies are using the toilet.”	Bengaluru,toilet facilities,construction labourers,	 Jun 13 2019
Reconstruction of complexes : HC notice to BDA head	the Bangalore Development Authority commissioner while hearing a petition challenging a plan to demolish and reconstruct/renovate 20 BDA complexes constructed recently.A division bench comprising Chief Justice A S Oka and Justice H T Narendra Prasad was hearing a petition filed by Neelira M Subbaiah, a resident of New Thippasandra, who moved the court seeking directions to stay the proposal to renovate/reconstruct, BDA complexes at a cost of Rs 330 crore.The petitioner stated that officials in-charge neglected 20 BDA complexes due to collusion with the vested interests/offenders, who have illegally converted lakhs of residential sites into commercial ones without authority and against the BDA law, resulting in serious congestion of road.The petitioner also stated that the complexes were being used for immoral activities.The petitioner also alleged that the BDA officials in charge of the 20 complexes looted crores of rupees by obtaining false sanctions and in the guise of maintenance charges. However, the complexes are maintained below any engineering standards.The petitioner stated that spending Rs 330 crore for the renovation of the complexes is a wasteful expenditure, and the complexes can be retained as they were recently constructed and just require good maintenance.The court directed the BDA commissioner to file objections and adjourned the case for hearing to July 9.

Operators cheer DyCM’s word on carpool	carpooling app ‘Quick Ride’ has renewed the hopes of bike taxi aggregators, including Ola, whose operations were shut down owing to lack of legal provisions.In a letter to the transport minister, Parameshwara said the government should recognise and support car and bikepooling ventures.“About 6.5 lakh people or organisations have already used services of the app. The state government is also encouraging car pool / bike pool. I request you to consider their plea for recognition and give instructions to officials concerned on its operation,” he said in the letter, a copy of which is available with DH.The move comes weeks after a report by a high-level committee stating that bike taxis were not viable. Citing rising bike accidents and greater number of two-wheelers in the city, the committee made of senior officials dealing with traffic congestion said allowing commercial operation of such vehicles would make people vulnerable.Bike taxis have faced opposition from BMTC, autorickshaw union and cab drivers who have said that their revenue will be hit if the government legalises such entities.While Quick Ride operates in a slightly different model than Ola or Uber, sources in the industry said the cab aggregators would be more than happy to offer such services. “They will rule the urban transport sector if bike taxis are allowed,” an expert said but declined to comment on whether it will affect public transport.The Regional Transport Office had cracked down on Ola and Rapido, seizing more than 300 bikes offering such services. Officials have also filed a complaint against Rapido with cyber police, after the aggregator continued to run services despite the freeze.Officials were not aware of the deputy chief minister’s recommendation. “We have not heard about it. Right now, we are working on shutting illegal operations run through back door mechanisms. If the government opens the main door, then it’s a policy decision we can’t question,” an official said.

Green panel to inspect site of upcoming waste plant 	Energy (WtE) plant in Chikkanagamangala near Electronics City have prompted the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to plan a spot inspection. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) signed a deal with three companies last year to set up the WtE plant, construction for which will begin in three months. Residents are firmly opposing the plant amid mounting concerns over its hazardous effects. “The plant would be incineration-based,” Pranay Dubey, a member of the group Electronics City Rising, said. “It’ll emit toxic gases, fly ash and bottom ash. Such plants did not succeed in India and cause irrevocable damage to the environment. We need to learn from the mistakes other states have made and shouldn’t repeat them.” He said WtEs spark widespread opposition among citizens. “For example, there have been continuous protests against the Okhla plant (in Delhi) and the NGT slapped environmental compensation of Rs 25 lakh on the plant,” he said, warning that the proposed plant would destroy Bengaluru’s ecology. Residents already have to cope with the existing waste processing plant in the area that emits a foul odour and poisonous gas.Their protests failed to draw the attention of the regulatory authorities. Worried that the new plant would worsen the situation, residents wrote to the NGT that responded saying that it had processed their complaint and will inspect the place. A BBMP official said the plant would sort out mixed waste collected especially from the black spots and from the roadside.“The BBMP has no say in the location of the plant. The regulatory authority would take a call on that. We’re just beneficiaries and will abide by the decisions of the concerned authorities. We’ll see to it that the contractor follows the environmental standards while building it,” he added.	Bengaluru,National Green Tribunal,NGT,waste management,	 Jun 13 2019
Door-to-door collection of garbage in a mess	clusters across the city is in a mess. Reason: collectors come and go in a jiffy, while residents have no organised plan to keep the solid waste segregated and ready to be picked up.Is there a way out? The Bangalore Apartments Federation (BAF) offers a solution, which has worked well for thousands of flats under its umbrella: segregate the waste, place them at a central point from where the sanitation workers pick it at the time of their choice.As BAF treasurer Vikram Rai puts it, appointing working welfare committees to manage this process can do the trick.Yet, poor coordination remains a major obstacle for seamless waste pickup, as a DH team found out in localities across Bengaluru. Many residents say their efforts to segregate and collect comes to nothing when the waste pickup system does not stick to schedules.Residents of Kamalanagar, Vidyaranyapura, Thindlu, Peenya and Richards Park say they are strict about segregation. But, as Kamalanagar resident Monisha admits, this civic responsibility is not the rule. There are people who throw garbage on roads and empty fields, she adds, attributing this to the difference in timings of the arrival of trucks.In Chowdeshwari Nagar, Frazer Town, Chamarajpet and Benson Town, residents have another complaint, which finds its echo across the city: Though they segregate the waste, the garbage collectors dump them all together. This results in a lack of interest among residents to segregate.But the sanitation workers do not agree to this. They say the residents are irresponsible, and the work of segregation falls entirely on them. One of them, Chinnababu says at least 15-20 houses in a day give out mixed garbage. When the pourakarmikas refuse to accept them, residents dump the waste on the road, he adds.This contention does not cut any ice with Anjana, a resident of Marathahalli. She charges the garbage collectors with bribery. “They only go to lanes where they are paid extra. Lack of regular pay and low wages drive them to unethical practices like these. This affects the general population as a whole,” she explains.To tide over these issues, the Richards Park Residents Welfare Association has activated a plan. Association member, Zakir Hussain elaborates: “We have put up five trash cans in every apartment and two in individual homes to segregate waste, strictly following waste management rules. Palike workers collect the wet waste daily, while private workers pick up the dry waste thrice a week.”Those who miss the trucks, Hussain adds, are asked to place their bins inside the apartments. These bins are cleared the next day. “This prevents garbage being dumped on the roads, and the area remains clean.”	"Garbage collection,waste management,Door-to-door garbage collection from small apartments and unorganised residential clusters across the city is in a mess.

Civic apathy: Bins damaged, go missing on Church Street	attention. Lack of proper maintenance, vandalism, instances of theft and sewage overflow from a nearby street is threatening to undo the expensive beautification completed two years ago.A reality check by DH revealed that of 20 odd dustbins installed along the 700 metre stretch of the road, less than half were in a fit condition. While three of the dustbin stands along the street were ripped off both the bins — green for wet waste and blue for dry waste — six of the stands had only one of the two bins remaining. Many bins were either damaged or splattered with the stains of pans.Preetham, an employee of Bookworm, located on Church Street, blamed both the general public and civic authorities for the condition of the bins and bollards installed on the footpath. “Bins have been vandalised by the public. Generally, vandalism occurs in the later hours of the day when all shops are closed,” he said.“The bins are also not cleared regularly. There are instances when the overflowing bins are cleared once in every two or three days,” he said.Deepak Batavia, president of Church Street Occupants Association, said that the main reason for poor bins and solid waste management was that the Palike had not assigned a proper contractor.On dumping of waste in the bins, he said it was difficult for the vendors to make people drop dry and wet waste in separate bins. “However, we have directed shops and hotels to segregate waste,” he said. A meeting will be convened shortly with BBMP authorities to discuss these issues, he said.Civic apathyWhen contacted, K T Nagaraj, chief engineer (Projects Central), said the dustbins were damaged due to civic apathy. “People are damaging these bins. Moreover, there are also cases of theft. Two Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) covers of underground drainage and optical fibre cable ducts were stolen recently,” he said.The corporation has replaced the FRP covers. Against whom can we file a complaint about the damaged dustbins? he questioned. He said the BBMP, along with the police, was installing CCTV cameras which would help identify those responsible for vandalism in the future, he added.	infrastructure,TenderSURE,Bengaluru,Church Street,	 Jun 13 2019
Medicinal plant garden to come up at Kidwai	garden of medicinal plants in the near future. An estimated 2,000 plants of over 500 species are to be planted in the campus.The institute has joined hands with environmentalists and support groups for the purpose. The Kidwai campus is in a 40-acre plot with several constructions.According to the institute’s director, Dr C Ramachandra, new saplings will be planted in the available space.“The idea is to ensure that patients breathe clean air. It will benefit those who accompany the patients, the staff and everyone else at the campus,” Dr Ramachandra told DH.Environmentalist Yellappa Reddy and members of Indus Herbs are working on this. Reddy said the work has begun. “However, the debris inside the campus must be cleared first,” he said.“We intend to complete the work within 60 days,” Reddy added. Reddy and his team have listed plants that purify air and are known to kill bacteria and viruses.“The idea is to improve air quality. A sneeze is enough to spread a disease. These plants are known for medicinal value and help regulate clean air,” Reddy explained.According to Reddy, the plants would enhance aesthetics too. “We have picked plants like Plumeria. It blooms for six to seven months. The flowers contain volatile oil. On exposure to sunlight, molecules are released into the air. This is known to have various benefits,” he said.Another is Kanaka Champa, believed to have aromatic oils. “Complex chemicals and pathogens cannot easily develop resistance to it,” Reddy pointed out.Other smaller plants such as Magara Patram and Tulasi, rich in oils, have also made the list apart from aromatic hedge plants such as Vitex negundo.Once the garden is set up, the nurses and staff at the institute will tend the plants.

10 yrs on, Majestic intermodal transit hub yet to begin	at Majestic, the government has consistently looked away even as increased traffic congestion has choked the area where poor planning and lack of integration have led to chaos.As the bus station at Majestic completed 50 years earlier this month, officials noted that the crisis caused by the lack of integration in the area needs immediate attention.The first plan to set up was first drawn in 2005, but the then management had to put it aside due to the lack of clarity on the metro. To a question, retired IAS officer M R Srinivasa Murthy, who was then the managing director of KSRTC, said commuting in Majestic was a major problem even in 2005.“We prepared a plan. But had to wait for the completion of the metro project, particularly the intersection of the two lines which would determine the metro station and surrounding area. Considering that the situation has worsened today, the project needs to be taken up immediately,” said.In 2011, a draft feasibility report proposed an intermodal transit hub providing seamless connectivity between metro, BMTC and KSRTC buses. The proposal included a 40-storey building, whose commercial and office space was expected to bring in revenue for the corporation.The plan consolidated the area of BMTC and KSRTC and the hub was to come upon 32.5 acres. Of the 44 acres, nearly 8 acres were given to the Kempegowda metro station.However, the estimated cost of Rs 1,800 crore that only one bidder met the conditions made the officials take a step back. “Three major companies had expressed interest in the project. But only one met the conditions. There was a concern that awarding the project to the lone bidder would lead to controversy,” a KSRTC official said.A retired official, who was part of the corporation during the time, said the government showed no interest in taking up the proposal. “The project was later modified to reduce the cost to Rs 1,200 crore. But KSRTC was seen as an isolated agency. No one in the government tried to follow up on the project. So, it was eventually forgotten,” the official said.When the project was conceived, the vehicle population in the city was about 30 lakh. As per the recent reports, the number of vehicles in the city has crossed 80 lakh.Last year, KSRTC renewed its efforts to build the hub at Majestic and invited bids to select a consultant for preparing a new detailed project report. “Since only one bidder expressed interest, we had to call the tender again. The technical proposals and the financial proposals will be evaluated soon,” an official said.	Majestic,infrastructure,	 Jun 13 2019
An initiative to keep Bengaluru plastic-free	by around 150 ragpickers in and around Chikkabanavara, enabling them to earn a sizable Rs 4,000 a month.It then sends the plastic waste as fuel to the cement industry to replace coal.The initiative is a joint venture of Indian Beauty & Hygiene Association (IBHA) and Isha Fiber and Fuel Source (IFFS). It segregates used tetra packs, snack covers and plastic materials with aluminium coating compress and transports them to the cement industry.Though the materials pollute the air when they are burnt and are declared unfit for recycling, they could substitute coal in the cement industry, which the state pollution control board actually permits since they are burnt at temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius.“India discards 80% of plastic, around 25,000 tons per day, which goes to landfills,” IBHA president Dinesh Dayal told DH. “Bengaluru alone is generating around 3,500 tonnes of waste per day, 100 tonnes of which is thin plastic.” He said three tonnes of thin plastic can replace two tonnes of coal at the cement industry. “The material we transport (to the cement factories) is useless and a pollutant.”The initiative would also give ragpickers a chance to develop skills and find employment, while also ensuring financial security.Ragpickers are incentivised based on the weight of the plastic they collect. While a kilo of plastic fetches them Rs 4, they could earn up to Rs 100 a day by collecting 30 tonnes of plastic. “Earlier, we thought only glass bottles and (empty) milk sachets would earn us more. But we now understand the value of the waste,” Rahul, a ragpicker from Delhi, said. “Besides collection, segregation of waste keeps us occupied the whole day. We are earning our livelihood and there is guaranteed money if we do our work,” he added.People behind the initiative have plans to tie up with BBMP to increase the amount of waste. Besides cement, the plastic waste could also be used in other ways like road construction. “We are able to help the ragpickers as well as the environment though this initiative,” Dayal said.

Slow removal of tree debris in RR Nagar angers locals	Thursday’s heavy rain, residents of Rajarajeshwari Nagar are furious that they have not cleared the trees ripped during the downpour.The downpour toppled 55 trees and 250 branches. Though the city as a whole suffered due to the rain on June 6, RR Nagar bore the brunt. It took until Sunday for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike to compute the correct figures of the fallen trees, which, in the end, was nearly three times the initial estimation of 20. Tree falls also caused incessant power cuts in the area.Repeated complaints by the residents prompted Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun to inspect the locality. “When I visited the area, I learnt that the BBMP staff was working really hard for the past two days to clear the (fallen) trees and branches. Teams were working day and night,” she said.Cutting a single half-broken tree and clearing the debris takes nearly three hours, she said. “Fifty-five trees have fallen in the area. The BBMP deployed eight teams of forest department officials in the city to attend to the issues related to toppled trees. We have also brought in the control room staff for the task,” she said.Some streets in RR Nagar did not have power supply until Sunday due to the toppled trees. “I heard from tree experts that RR Nagar has several 40- to 50-year-old trees that can’t withstand heavy winds. There are no cases of trees falling due to root damages caused externally,” Gangambike said, assuring that the corporation would clear the old trees.The mayor said she has instructed forest officials not to put pressure on workers while clearing the debris. “There were instances where heavy tree logs had fallen on workers’ legs causing injury. I don’t want that to happen since they also have families,” she said.	"rain,Tree felling,As officials go through the painful process of estimating Thursday’s heavy rain, residents of Rajarajeshwari Nagar are furious that they have not cleared the trees ripped during the downpour.
The downpour toppled 55 trees and 250 branches. Though the city as a whole suffered due to the rain on June 6, RR Nagar bore the brunt. It took until Sunday for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike to compute the correct figures of the fallen trees, which, in the end, was nearly three times the initial estimation of 20. Tree falls also caused incessant power cuts in the area.
Repeated complaints by the residents prompted Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun to inspect the locality. “When I visited the area, I learnt that the BBMP staff was working really hard for the past two days to clear the (fallen) trees and branches. Teams were working day and night,” she said.
Cutting a single half-broken tree and clearing the debris takes nearly three hours, she said. “Fifty-five trees have fallen in the area. The BBMP deployed eight teams of forest department officials in the city to attend to the issues related to toppled trees. We have also brought in the control room staff for the task,” she said.
Some streets in RR Nagar did not have power supply until Sunday due to the toppled trees. “I heard from tree experts that RR Nagar has several 40- to 50-year-old trees that can’t withstand heavy winds. There are no cases of trees falling due to root damages caused externally,” Gangambike said, assuring that the corporation would clear the old trees.
The mayor said she has instructed forest officials not to put pressure on workers while clearing the debris. “There were instances where heavy tree logs had fallen on workers’  legs causing injury. I don’t want that to happen since they also have families,” she said.

Baiyappanahalli bridge work resumes tomorrow	"start on Tuesday, Bangalore Central parliamentarian P C Mohan said on Sunday. The work has been stuck for the past seven years owing to problems over defence land. The railways built half of the bridge about five years ago but could not complete the work as defence authorities did not provide the land for finishing the other half. In a tweet that received a huge response, Mohan said: ""Happy to update that work on long pending, incomplete ROB in Baiyappanahalli wil start on 11th June. I thank Smt @nsitharaman for releasing Def land & Rly Min Shri @PiyushGoyal for taking interest on this infra proj that wil provide huge relief to commuters (sic)."""

Reverse osmosis water filters unhealthy: WHO	"health according to a recent warning issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO).RO filters not just kills the bacteria, but removes all salts and essential nutrients such as calcium and magnesium.Experts have been warning about the rapid rise in the use of RO filters lately. Nevertheless, the government goes on installing RO plants in every nook and corner in the name of 'pure drinking water’.M V Shashirekha, former chemist at the Department of Mines and Geology, says RO plants are good for highly contaminated groundwater with nitrate, flouride, etc. ""From other sources though, RO filtered water can be harmful as it removes all essential nutrients,"" she adds. “Reverse osmosis employs a partially permeable membrane to remove ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles from drinking water. This may reduce the concentration of particulate matter including suspended particles, bacteria and algae, reducing the concentration of a range of dissolved and particulate substances. Cauvery water may not require an RO filter. However, borewell water having high nitrates needs RO membrane filtering, as nitrates cannot be removed by boiling or other filters. The RO filter, meanwhile, removes all the essential minerals. To treat 10 litres of water, nine litres of water is drained, contaminating the groundwater. Those dependent on borewells must test the water quality and then zero in on the right filters,” Shashirekha elaborates.A R Shivakumar, senior scientist, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Science, says the water filter lobby is so strong that they will never allow any study that would harm the business.""RO plants are not calibrated keeping in mind the water source,"" he points out.What WHO says The presence of minimum/optimum concentration of calcium and magnesium in drinking water signify “energy content”. RO machines are very effective in cleaning water, but they remove calcium and magnesium, the elements responsible for producing energy. Therefore, long-term consumption of acidic water devoid of essential elements produced by RO filters is very unhealthy."	water quality,WHO,Bengaluru,	 Jun 09 2019
City rail division leader in SWR’s green initiatives	32 trains between Bengaluru and Mysuru from diesel to electric traction, reducing their running cost by 40%.The conversion has saved 1,260 litres of diesel for each pair of trains. Officials also said slow-moving diesel trains have been converted into Mainline Electric Multiple Units.On the occasion, Divisional Railway Manager Ashok Kumar Verma unveiled SWR’s first vertical garden at the KSR Bengaluru station.“In the past one year, we have developed about 50 gardens around the Bengaluru division. This will continue in the upcoming year and we will make this division even more beautiful. Today, we are planting more than 5,000 trees here,” he said. A total of 38,072 trees have been planted across the railway land.The division has also taken up the project to set up solar panels. The total installed capacities of the solar panels over the SBC division was 805 kWp, where 1 kWp will generate 1,500 units of electricity annually.The railways hopes to save Rs 42.63 lakh per year through this initiative.In a first of its kind initiative in SWR, the Bengaluru division also installed eight 7.5 HP and eight 5 HP solar pumps to promote renewable energy. These pumps, said to generate 1.63 lakh units of electricity, will save Rs 14.17 lakh annually.Two recycling plants — one at the KSR station with 10 lakh litre capacity and 60-70% utilisation and another at the Yeshwantpur station with 4 lakh litre capacity and 50% utilisation — were installed. Both these stations save Rs 30 lakh every month in the bill amount paid to BWSSB.In another major green effort, the Bengaluru division has taken up solid waste management mainly from railway residential colonies from where the biodegradable waste will be sent to compost sheds and non-biodegradable waste handed to the BBMP-appointed waste collectors. Adopting the Miyawaki plantation method, the division planted 2,000 saplings in 600 sqm in 2016 and 2,100 saplings in 650 sqm in 2017. It began recharging borewells and composting kitchen waste at the Krishnarajapuram diesel loco shed.(Akira Miyawaki is a Japanese botanist and expert in plant ecology, who is active worldwide as a specialist in the restoration of natural vegetation on degraded land.)

Expedite suburban rail project: minister to officials	on Friday instructed the railway officials to expedite the proposed Bengaluru suburban railway project.Angadi, who held a meeting with Railway Board officials on pending projects in Karnataka here, directed them to take up the matter with the state government and get early clearances of pending issues.Despite Railway Minister Piyush Goyal agreeing to execute the project at the earliest during his visit to Bengaluru early this year, it got delayed following the Prime Minister Office asking the Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Limited (K-RIDE) to revise the detailed project report (DPR).The Centre had asked the K-RIDE to revise the DPR considering factors like reducing the number of stations in the core city area to ensure suburban rail network does not overlap with the Namma Metro network.In the meeting, which Bengaluru Central MP P C Mohan also attended, the minister said he would also take up the matter with the state government on expediting the DPR.The minister directed the officials to complete the ongoing doubling works of the Pune- Miraj- Londa and Hubli -Davangere-Tumkur railway line by 2020.On long pending Hubbali- Ankola railway line, the minister asked the officials to take up the matter with Karnataka for getting early forest and other clearances.	suburban railways,Bengaluru,	 Jun 08 2019
Level crossings remain major bane for railways	in the city has been a major hindrance for the railways to introduce more trains, at a time when the demand for more trains on local routes has gained fever pitch.Work on removing about 25 LCs in Bengaluru division has been pending for years due to various reasons, with the lack of land to build a road over bridge (ROB) or road under bridge (RUB) becoming the major headache. The best example being the ROB near Byappanahalli railway station, where the railways completed its work back in 2014. Wilderness has taken over the half-completed bridge as defence authorities have not handed over a small piece of land required to build the landing of the bridge on the southern side.Railway activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar, who obtained the information through RTI, said LCs have affected the functioning of railways. “Eliminating LCs will enhance the capacity of railway lines by more than 50%. Add to this, doubling and automatic signalling works and there is near 100% increase in capacity.” Yashwantpur-Yelahanka, Hosur-Anekal Road, Karmelram-Byappanahalli, Banaswadi-Hebbal, Channasandra-Yelahanka, Rajanukunte-Dodaballapur, Yelahanka-Channasandra, Byappanhalli-Dharmavaram are some stretches where work has been pending for years.

No gym and pool in park, HC tells BBMP	from constructing facilities like a swimming pool and gymnasium inside the Gayatri Devi Park (Mariappanapalya Park) in Prakashnagar, Rajajinagar. A division bench passed the interim order while hearing a PIL filed by J Srinivas and three others, who have moved the court challenging the construction of swimming pool, multi-purpose gymnasium and gazebos inside the park. The court also issued a notice to the state and the Palike.The petitioners contended that the park is the only green lung space in the area and putting up permanent structures will convert it into a concrete jungle.Further, they also submitted a representation to the MLA of Rajajinagar constituency, requesting him to not allow any construction within the park in view of the Karnataka Parks, Play Fields and Open Spaces (Preservation and Regulation) Act, 1985. However, the authorities concerned are going ahead with the construction, they said. The court adjourned the hearing to June 21.	Bengaluru,Karnataka High Court,BBMP,	 Jun 08 2019
Thunderstorm destruction writ large on city landscape	hundreds of trees, electricity poles and transformers, besides inflicting damage on scores of vehicles and plunging large parts of the city into darkness. The damage was so extensive in northern and western Bengaluru that Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara had to visit many areas on Monday and order civic officials to get cracking. As per the latest count, at least 100 trees and 500 branches have been uprooted. Parameshwara, who visited Vijayanagar, Malleswaram, West of Chord Road and other areas affected by the heavy rain, asked the officials to clear the debris immediately. He also instructed Bescom officials to restore the power supply. Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, Vijayanagar MLA M Krishnappa and others accompanied him during the inspection. Speaking to reporters later, Parameshwara said a total of 61 teams from the BBMP, Bescom and other departments were working overtime to clear the debris from streets and restore the power supply. “The BBMP control room enabled us to be aware of the rain-related problems in real time,” he added. Stating that some parts of Karnataka had received more than 120 mm of rainfall in the past few days, the deputy chief minister stressed that the BBMP was well-prepared for the monsoon that was expected to arrive in Bengaluru in a few days.He said he had instructed the officials at an earlier meeting to take the necessary steps to tackle the problems arising out of monsoon. He said low-lying areas of the city had not been flooded and sought to take credit for that. Parameshwara held another meeting with BBMP and Bescom officials about the rain preparedness, asking the agencies about the steps they had taken to avoid the flooding of streets and the potholes on roads. BBMP officials replied that they were removing silt from stormwater drains and that a premix of bitumen and sand had arrived from Tamil Nadu to fill up potholes. Parameshwara further ordered the officials to clear garbage black spots as these might block rainwater and emit a foul smell leading to health hazards. He also asked the officials of the BBMP control room and other helplines to remain alert throughout the monsoon. Officials said they were planning to raise awareness about the dangers of power lines by conducting painting and essay competitions on the topic for schoolchildren.

K-Rera wants citizens to spot unregistered properties	verifying the registration of every property, the Karnataka Real Estate Regulatory Authority (K-Rera) has reached out to people. It has asked the public to be its eyes and ears to report unregistered properties. Officials said its recent public notice to educate people on the Rera Act was also an attempt to seek their help. While Rera is not new, it is not very well known, which is a challenge. “People should be informed (about Rera) and they should inform us if they get to know of any unregistered property,” K-Rera chairman M R Kamble said. Kamble reasoned the decision to seek public help. Officials usually run through advertisements issued by realtors to verify the details, but the department is short-staffed and it is also challenging to physically verify all the properties.Citizens can check the Rera website at the builder’s office to ascertain the registration details. They can also demand a copy of the registration from the builders. If the builders fail to produce the copy, citizens should report them to K-Rera, an official said.Most are not aware that the builder is required to present a copy of the registration or share the online details with the buyers. Officials said they also came across cases where builders and realtors have diverted the funds allocated and kept aside in the escrow account, a violation of the Rera Act which buyers should promptly report. Kamble admitted that the authority was not aware of all methods of irregularities and it is incumbent on the citizens to report them.	KRERA,Bengaluru,	 May 26 2019
Just 3-year guarantee for elevated corridor	guarantee of only three years, beyond which the state government has to fund the repairs and maintenance of the structure. Sources in the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) told DH that out of the three financial models that were proposed, the KRDCL has favoured the use of public funds under the engineering, procurement contract (EPC).According to experts, the KRDCL’s choice would mean that the elevated corridor would turn out to be just another flyover requiring huge amounts of public money for its upkeep.Officials said the other two methods of funding the project involved levying of a toll on users for a prescribed period of time.Shivakumar BS, Managing Director, KRDCL, said, “We will make use of the public money for executing the entire project as this will result in no toll on the elevated roads.”Giving details on the nature of the financial proposal, KS Krishna Reddy, Secretary, PWD, said the “financial model facilitates the bidder to construct the elevated corridor on our investment”.“The contractor can change the structural design of the bridge apart from the height, width, quality and curve junctions of the road. Following the construction, it will have the Defect Liability Period (DLP) or in common words the guarantee period of three years.”Earlier, in its Detailed Project Report (DPR), the KRDCL had proposed three financial models: Public Funds under EPC, Private Public Partnership (PPP) and PPP plus Viability Gap Funding (VGF) toll for the construction of the corridor. However, according to the KRDCL, both the second and third proposals were found to be unfeasible.	Bengaluru,KRDCL,Elevated corridors,	 May 26 2019

BBMP razes tilting building in Horamavu	"the Banaswadi railway underpass in Horamavu.It began the demolition job after evacuating seven families living adjacent to the tilting structure. The 450-square foot structure, built 13 years ago, began tilting when the adjacent site was dug up. The BBMP has filed a case against the building's owner Hukum Singh and Kumaresh who dug up the adjacent site for the foundation. The case was filed at the Horamavu police station. The BBMP evacuated the seven families living next to the tilting structure and began breaking it down on Tuesday morning. It razed 60% of the building and will complete the work by Wednesday evening. One Hitachi machine and 15 labourers were pressed into service. BBMP officials said the structure was built before Horamavu came under its jurisdiction and there are no fitness certificates in its possession. Meanwhile, the civic body has served notice to Kumaresh, who owns the adjacent plot, to stop construction activities on the site and has asked him to submit all necessary documents within 24 hours. BBMP officials have found in their preliminary investigation that the building's foundation was weak. Only three feet of soil was removed to lay its foundation, while no iron rods were used to raise the pillars. ""The building had more floors than its actual capacity and the structure tilted as a result,"" said an official."	BBMP,	 May 15 2019
Cubbon Park to get 65 recharge wells	"to Bengaluru's prime lung space, Cubbon Park, as the park will get around 65 shallow wells to recharge the already revived open wells.As many as seven old open wells were revived in Cubbon Park to recharge groundwater two years ago. After identifying the potential of these wells, the horticulture department with help from private firms and NGOs had revived them. Now, to recharge them, the department will dig up 65 shallow recharging pits/wells at a depth of 13 to 16 ft.The source of the well is an aquifer — an underground layer of permeable soil that contains water and allows its passage. As the rain has already begun, officials and water experts are hoping the wells will do good to the park.India Cares Foundation is the enabler NGO supporting the cause as a part of the 'Million Wells' campaign for water security and sustainability of Bengaluru.""The current water facility at the park is not enough for it to sustain. The horticulture department uses treated water from a 1.5 MLD sewage treatment plant in the park and the remaining from the supply from the BWSSB. But this water is not enough. Hence, the recharge pits are necessary,"" said Shubha Ramachandran, water team head, BIOME Environmental Trust, which launched the campaign along with Friends of Lakes, a lake protection group.Another expert opined that recharge pits may generate more than 80,000 litres of water a day in future, and the park can sustain if the demand for water doesn’t increase.Bhovi community to help""We have identified around 500 families in the city from the Bhovi community, who are traditionally associated with the well-digging job known as 'Mannu Oddaru'. These people have been digging wells from more than a thousand years now. They know exactly how to dig and with the correct specifications,"" said Ram Prasad, Friends of Lakes.Ponds to be revivedThree ponds in the park, including Karagada Kunte, Lotus Pond and the one behind the Wodeyar Statue, will be revived.

Baiyappanahalli rail station to get major makeover	Sangolli Rayanna (KSR) station in Majestic, the Centre will upgrade the Baiyappanahalli Railway Station on international standards.To develop Baiyappanahalli on global standards, the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Ltd (IRSDC) on Monday held a meeting with builders and investors from the city to invest on the proposed project comprising 26 lakh sq ft of built-up area.Making use of the 132 acres of land available in and around Baiyappanahalli station, the IRSDC proposes to develop six additional platforms, four station buildings, an access road, bus bay and a foot-over-bridge at the station. According to the plan, the Baiyappanahalli station will also feature a passenger lounge on the lines of airports allowing passengers to rest while waiting for trains. Besides, the station will have 30 acres of land that could be commercially developed under private-public participation (PPP).IRSDC, which is estimating a Rs 250-crore investment from private firms and builders, will offer built-up areas to investors and builders on a 99-year lease for commercial and residential purpose, while the project is expected to be completed in 6-8 years. The South Western Railway (SWR) is currently building a third station terminal at the station for which it has already invested Rs 150 crore.Speaking to DH about the project, Sanjeev Dyamannavar, city transport activist said, “The idea appears to be nice. At last the station will witness international standards. However, it would be ideal if the railways involve BMTC, BMRCL, BBMP and BDA in the coordination committee and work together.

BBMP to invest in 29 skywalks based on demand	its money in building 29 skywalks in the city. Out of the 153 proposed skywalks, only 37 are completed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). Instead of completing the pending skywalks, the Palike has proposed 29 new structures at various locations considering “huge demand”. BBMP’s decision to fund the project, at a time when it is struggling to fund other projects, is baffling.The civic body cites other infrastructural projects in the city for the delay in the construction of unfinished skywalks.“Many skywalk constructions are put on hold and some have not even started yet as there are metro stations coming up in some areas, along with ongoing road widening and white-topping works,” said a BBMP official. The bidders are refusing to take up certain projects, he added.According to the official, 29 skywalks were proposed after considerable pressure from the Bengaluru Traffic Police and citizen activists, concerned about pedestrian safety.“These 29 structures may encounter hurdles again due to other civic infrastructural projects,” he added.BBMP Commissioner, N Manjunath Prasad, said the skywalks in the city were supposed to follow the public-private partnership (PPP) model initially. “There are no takers for most skywalks. But there are areas that are demanding skywalks. Hence the BBMP has decided to invest. DPR is ready for the 29 skywalks and work orders have been issued. The project might cost more than Rs 50 crore,” said Prasad. BBMP will soon launch online monitoring of lifts and escalators on all the skywalks in the city, including the proposed 29, to check if pedestrians are actually using the skywalks. “Bosch has taken up the project to monitor online sensors. It is yet to get the green signal,” said the official.	BBMP,skywalks,	 May 13 2019
Sewage monitoring systems in Lalbagh, Cubbon Park	installing sewage quality monitoring systems to get real-time information on effluent from the Tertiary Treatment Plants (TTPs) at the city’s two prime lung spaces, Lalbagh and Cubbon Park.The monitoring system will give data on pollutants in the treated water.Much of the treated water goes toward watering the plants in both the parks, since the board supplies just a third of the actual requirement. The parks have TTPs with extended aeration. The probes (sensors) are fixed at the outlet - the point where the treated water passes through the parks’ TTP systems.Lalbagh’s TTP has 4 MLD (Million Litres Per Day) capacity, while the Cubbon Park’s TTP has 1.5 MLD capacity. The probes measure various parameters and offer a list of pollutants in the treated water. Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board’s (BWSSB) technical team will get the data every 15 minutes.The parameters include pH, temperature, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), dissolved oxygen, ammonia content and others.No manual processThe online system would obviate the existing manual process where lab reporters collect the samples and test them –a process that takes nearly five days to complete.The BWSSB has called the tenders and the monitoring system will be in place in some time.The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had control of the Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and the TTPs until a few years ago before the BWSSB took over. Both Lalbagh and Cubbon Park need 1.5 MLD of water for their plants.	Lalbagh,BWSSB,Sewage,Cubbon Park,	 May 11 2019
Are civic agencies complacent about monsoon?	city, civic agencies seem complacent in their preparedness for the forthcoming monsoon.While the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) made a list of 201 flood-prone areas in the city and handed it to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), little action has been taken to fix the issues.KSNDMC and BBMP officials planned to survey all the locations to choose 25 points for installation of water sensors. But they have only made three tentative choices -Madiwala lake outlet near silk board junction, Jayanagar east in Krishnappa Garden (behind Byrasandra tank) and Bapuji Nagar upstream of Galianjaneya temple.Deputy Chief Minister and Bengaluru Development Minister G Parameshwara had set May end to finish all preparatory work for the monsoon. Officials from both agencies assure that work has been ongoing.KSNDMC’s scientific officer-Hydrology Shubha Avinash is hopeful that the work should be over by end of May. She said her agency is working with BBMP to identify the flooding points based on previous flooding history.BBMP officials also assure that desilting and other work on stormwater drains will be done to install water sensors. But a Palike official who did not wish to be named admitted that readying all 201 places could be difficult.Both the agencies are planning to take up work at areas near drains in the first phase, depending on how the monsoon behaves. The KSNDMC also wants to independently review the works done by the BBMP in all wards.KSNDMC has listed vulnerable locations based on its mapping of the flood-prone areas since 2011.Some of the vulnerable spots in the list include Jayamahal road (from Doordarshan center to JC Nagar), Shivananda Junction (where BBMP is building the steel flyover), UB City Road, Indiranagar 80 feet Road, Kalyannagar 100 feet road, Kadugodi, Yeshwanthpur Railway station, City Market (KR Market), Wilson Garden up to Bannerghatta Road, Vidyapeeta Circle and Someshwara colony near silk board junction.

Girinagar residents oppose police station on playground	gathered in large numbers to protect a playground that was taken over to build a police station.A foundation stone was laid for building a police station on Thursday at a volleyball ground near Vivekananda Park in Girinagar, angering residents. Residents on Friday morning gathered in large numbers to protest against the government’s decision.“We have been using the ground for over 35 years. It is the only playground in this region for kids. If you are going to take away even that last standing open space, where shall we go?” questioned Sowmya Bhat, a resident of Girinagar.Krishnamurthy Hegde, another resident who was protesting said, “We are not against building a police station. But it can be built elsewhere. How could the officials hold a foundation laying ceremony when there is a model code of conduct across the state?”Later, Basavanagudi MLA Ravi Subramanya met the protesting residents and assured them that he would take up the matter with the Bengaluru city police commissioner T Suneel Kumar.“We have already discussed it with the commissioner. He has ordered a stop to the work with immediate effect and has given as assurance that the department would take up construction in a different place,” Subramanya said.	Bengaluru,	 May 11 2019
3,000 homes get dirty, foul-smelling water	water for the past six months, they were shocked to see the water filling their storage sumps entirely black on Thursday.Their complaints to BWSSB engineers have gone without response.“About 3,000 to 4,000 residents from 2nd Main to 13th Main between the Ramaiah College bus stop and Netaji Circle have been receiving contaminated water,” said M V Nagaraj, a resident, adding that no official had visited the locality to check the problem.He said the water emits a foul odour and is unusable for anything. Residents hire water tankers for non-potable purposes and use water from the filtration plant for drinking. But BWSSB assistant executive engineer K V Deepak insisted that the contaminated water went to the houses only from Thursday morning. “There was no water supply on Wednesday, leaving a vacuum in the pipes that absorbed the dirty water from the surrounding areas where they were laid,” he said.“We received complaints (about the contaminated water) only on Thursday morning and we settled it by afternoon. We have cleaned some houses and some sumps,” he said, adding the dirty water had only gone to about 500 houses.	BWSSB,Contaminated water,	 May 03 2019
Mayor assesses rain damage	for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). A few days ago, the Palike had declared its preparedness to tackle the monsoon woes ahead.Bracing for a normal monsoon, BBMP was caught off guard with the night-long rain ranging from heavy to violent in some of the Central Business District (CBD) areas, resulting in the death of a pedestrian.In less than a few hours after the showers began to lash the city, several major roads and underpasses were flooded leaving commuters stranded for hours.According to sources, some localities were waterlogged till morning reflecting poorly on the civic body’s desilting work.Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun, who had been in touch with all zones all through the night, went around the city assessing the damage.The mayor could not hold on any longer when she spotted waterlogged stretches near the Agara underpass and Sankey Road. She came down heavily on the engineers over their cavalier attitude and poor management of the situation.“At some locations, the openings of shoulder drains were small and it took quite some time to dewater the areas. But in these cases, it was sheer negligence of the engineers. I have warned them of stringent action if they continue to be callous,” Gangambike Mallikarjun told DH.While a huge quantity of silt had deposited at the underpass on the Airport Road, the underpass near Agara was not cleaned properly, according to officials.The Okalipuram stretch, where the work on the eight-lane corridor is in full swing, witnessed waterlogging till morning.“As the work is still under progress, we could not connect the drains properly at the site, leading to waterlogging. However, we have deployed special teams equipped with powerful pumps to dewater the area and make it ready for motorists,” a senior BBMP official said.B’luru Rural suffersThough a few areas in Bengaluru Metropolitan Area Zone (BMAZ) of Bescom witnessed prolonged power cuts up until midnight, the worst affected areas were under the Bengaluru Rural Area Zone (BRAZ).According to the data put out by Bescom engineers, in Bengaluru Rural, as many as 73 electric poles and at least eight transformers were damaged in the thundershower. In Bengaluru, meanwhile, only nine poles were damaged as two transformers failed.“Some of the localities such as Peenya, HSR Layout, Jalahalli, Whitefield, Kaggalipura and Lingarajapuram in the city limits were severely affected apart from Chandapura, Hoskote, Magadi, Tumakuru and Ramanagara, with both intermittent and prolonged power cuts as poles were broken and branches fell on the transmission lines,” a senior Bescom engineer revealed.

BBP wants BWSSB water for tourists, but not for animals	litres of water from the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) to meet the needs of tourists, shopkeepers and staff at the park, but not for the wild animals.Dr Sanjay Bijur, executive director, BBP, said there is a wrong assumption that the water is for the wild animals, but it is for the people who are visiting the park.“The Park receives about 25,000 visitors a month. The RO plant catering to the drinking water needs is not sufficient. Currently, the RO plant is able to filter about 100 litres of water per hour and the requirement per hour is more than what is filtered. We are about to commission two RO plants with higher capacity of filtering 1,000 litres per hour. But for the long run, we need water from the BWSSB,” added Bijur.According to the executive director, there are about 12 borewells and six lakes inside the park, quite sufficient for the wild animals. There is also a system that stores rainwater to replenish the borewells and lakes.“The animals do not require water. There is plenty now. In fact, to beat the heat, we are spraying water on the roofs of animal shelters. We will meet with BWSSB officials on Monday to decide on the feasibility of drawing water to the park,” the executive director clarified.However, B S Gangadhar, BWSSB chief engineer (maintenance), said the board’s pipeline towards Anekal and Suryanagar Housing Board crosses the Bannerghatta Circle. “The park is hardly 3 km from the circle. A water pipeline can be laid. However, the board has to take a decision on supplying water to the park,” he added.At the moment, about 1,450 mld of water is being drawn and supplied to the city. The demand for water, especially in summer, is increasing by the day. Until Cauvery Stage V gets commissioned in 2023, city dwellers will have to manage with the current supply.

Centre for excellence in Bangalore varsity	to establish a Centre for Excellence in microwave antennas and optoelectronics at the Bangalore University’s (BU) Jnana Bharathi campus.The centre will be a collabaration of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and various departments of the BU.“Rs 300 crore is proposed to be spent to develop the Centre for Excellence. This is a central government project where we will be granting 25 acres of land on lease to the state’s lone Central University. This will help the students of various streams at BU,” confirming the development, BU vice-chancellor Venugopal K R told DH.Various BU departments such as physics, mathematics, electronics, electronics and communication engineering, electrical and electronics engineering and computer science engineering stand to benefit.Both students and faculties will have access to better research, practical work and infrastructure. The project will bring down the burden on the university to establish special practical classes and laboratories.“As this is a joint collabaration of the DRDO and ISRO, students will be industry-ready. Antennas will be useful for communications and optoelectronics will be useful in electrical systems,” Venugopal added.The proposal for granting land is already approved in the syndicate and is now waiting for government nod. Soon after getting the green-signal, the project will take off. The Centre for Excellence will cater to more than two thousand students in various departments.“BU is the lone state varsity which is giving more importance to electronics and communications. We have proposed the centre as more departments stand to benefit,” a senior Central University official told DH.	Bangalore University,Centre for Excellence,	 May 01 2019
Coming up at Kidwai: 'Rich' block for poor patients	at the ‘Robinhood’ tax system model to fund the treatment for the poor.Those who can afford will be provided special treatment at nearly double the existing prices with better facilities with the establishment of a special block. Money generated here will be used to improve facilities for the poor.The block will offer facilities which the hospital authorities claim will be on par with the leading private hospitals. An estimated Rs 30 crore has been set aside for the block to be housed above the State Cancer Institute building.C Ramachandra, director, Kidwai hospital, told DH 180 to 200 more wards have been proposed that will have dedicated staff working round the clock.“We will maintain the standards of staff to patient ratio proposed by the Medical Council of India. If need be, we will also outsource the nursing staff to maintain the ratio,” he added.In the block, the wards will be air-conditioned. There will be separate nursing stations and also specialists will visit the patients at the bed.“There is an impression that government hospitals are meant for the poor. We have the best equipment. Yet, people think otherwise. We want to give the institute a facelift. The rich look at the ambience and we will provide it to them. If you are willing to shell out more, you will get the facility,” said Ramachandra.This is being planned on lines of Jayadeva Institute of Cardio Vascular Sciences and Research.The maximum charges for a bed are Rs 1,250. Other beds are for BPL patients that are free of cost. These are housed in the Shantidhama and Aniketana buildings.In the new block, prices would vary between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 per day subject to the facilities. If the cost of one session of radiotherapy is Rs 96,000 for those with BPL cards, others will have to pay Rs 2 lakh.The difference in amount will be used to improve facilities for the poor. “The rich will have to pay more for the facilities and this money will be used for the everyday needs of the poor. Even under government schemes, poor patients will have to pay beyond a limit. The amount will be adjusted here,” he said.	Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology,	 Apr 29 2019
Govt for hospital regulation following Nigerian’s death	overcharging by hospitals and said it will look into enhancing protection of patients in the wake of a Deccan Herald news report on April 25, detailing the death of a Nigerian national at Manipal Hospitals.Speaking to DH, principal secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, Jawaid Akhtar said that a provision exists within the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments (KPME) Act, allowing the public to report any hospital, dispensary or clinic that charges more than the established rate for services and care.“Public must file complaints with the health and family welfare commissioner, who is the chairman of the expert committee. An inquiry will be conducted and action will be taken,” he said and suggested that Tobi Ajisegbede of Lagos, Nigeria, who lost his mother, Juliet, at Manipal Hospitals on April 14, should write to the commissioner, asking him to initiate an inquiry.Activists and lawyers pointed out that while the KPME Act can address matters of financial abuse, it offers little in the way of offering succour to victims of negligence.Vijayakumar Seetappa of the medical watchdog, Karnataka Janaarogya Chaluvali, said a few Indian victims of negligence are able to get justice, much less than the thousands of foreign visitors who come for medical care.“There is no mechanism for redressal at all because medical care in India exists in a regulatory vacuum,” Seetappa said.City-based lawyer Taji George, who holds the same view, provided evidence of several cases of negligence by hospitals. “About 10% of all medical failures are a result of negligence and most of the victims are foreigners,” George said. “And, what is the government doing? Nothing.”Though the government mandates treatment rates, George said that a few hospitals display figures right, leading to exorbitant charges for treatment.With increasing cases of negligence, Akhtar said the government will strengthen regulations. “We are planning to appraise and train our people to be more vigilant,” he said. However, the system will only work if the public files complaints with the committee, the principal secretary added. A recap of the caseTobi Ajisegbede from Lagos, Nigeria, who lost his 58-year-old mother at Manipal Hospitals on April 14, alleged medical negligence of the hospital staff, and a pattern of extortion by the administration. For $10,000 (Rs 6,98,000), the hospital offered quick and effective results to Ajisegbede’s mother who was suffering from Lumbar Canal Stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal, compressing the nerves). But what ensued, according to Ajisegbede, was five months of prolonged treatment, which not only cost him and his family over $20,000 (Rs 13,96,000) but also his mother’s lifeOverview of medical tourismBetween 2014 and 2015, there were 4,60,000 foreigners who sought some form of treatment in Indian hospitals — 41,237 of whom had come to India on medical visas. According to figures from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics of India, these tourists added Rs 5,800,000,000 ($86.6 million) to the Indian economy.	surgeries,Medical Negligence,Regulation of hospitals,	 Apr 29 2019
Roads a bit safer as dry trees are felled	Hosur Road and Hebbal Ring Road after summer showers, the BBMP Forest Department has swung into action.The department has uprooted 615 dry trees and trimmed 3037 unhealthy tree branches in the city.The opposition slammed Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) forest officials during Saturday’s council meeting by presenting the list of fatal accidents caused by tree branches falling on the roads and urged them to take immediate action.“We could not act before such accidents occurred in all the zones of the city as we were facing a shortage of staff. Now that we have been given 7 teams extra with a total of 21 teams operating in the city, we will ensure the old and dry trees are uprooted and unhealthy branches are removed as soon as possible,” said MK Cholarajappa, BBMP Deputy Conservator of Forest.The uprooted trees will be transported to four depots located in various points of the city including Yelahanka and Kempapura where they will be auctioned. “We collected revenue of about 10 lakhs in the last one year after the auction of the felled trees and branches,” added Cholarajappa.The Department officials also explained the challenges they face in handling the issue. “Everyday, around 30 people from various NGOs meet me in my office. They emphasise on not cutting the trees. Most of the times, our contractors encounter environmentalists opposing cutting of trees at various areas,” said Cholarajappa.Forest officials also said they planted 75,000 trees last year. “We have called for tenders this year and the plantation work orders will be issued soon,” said Cholarajappa.Opposition leaders in the council accused Cholarajappa of striking a deal with a contractor regarding fallen trees and branches.Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun asked the absent DCF to inform the area corporator before felling the trees, avoid unauthorised tree felling and maintain transparency in the process.

BBMP to resume eviction drive around stormwater drains	monsoon woes across Bengaluru, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has set its eyes on the rampant encroachment of stormwater drains (SWDs). After a brief lull, the civic body, starting next week, is likely to begin its eviction drive in various zones. Briefing Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara on its action plan on Wednesday, BBMP officials stated that they have already cleared as many as 567 encroachments. Stopping its eviction drive on account of the Lok Sabha polls, the BBMP will resume it along all the SWDs, thereby putting an end to inundation of low-lying areas. This was discussed during the coordination meeting with Chief Secretary, T M Vijay Bhaskar, on Tuesday. Further, the BBMP was directed to take technical help from the Land Records Department. “Eviction is being done as per the court’s order. All SWDs will be cleared of encroachments. A team of surveyors has already been deployed to identify encroachments,” BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said. According to the findings, out of the 1,950 encroachments, 450 have been cleared. However, according to the data presented during the coordination meeting with the chief secretary, as many as 2,515 cases of encroachment were listed and in as many as 1,948 cases, surveys were yet to be conducted. While the BBMP cleared 428 encroachments in 2016-17 and 2017-18, officials cleared as many as 139 cases in 2018-19 from October 2018.	BBMP,Stormwater drains,	 Apr 25 2019
Uber to compete with public transport in new strategy	"aggregator has sought to shed its earlier claim of ""complementing"" public transport. The company has announced its vision of replacing ""public transportation, one use case at a time"", along with private vehicles. The global ridesharing giant set out its vision in documents filed at the Security Exchange Commission, United States, ahead of the much-talked-about initial public offering. India is one of the 57 countries, where the company sees potential in replacing public transport. The company goes into the details of potential markets and explains the prospect is in becoming the alternatives to the existing modes that serve trips of less than 30 miles (48 km). This essentially means that city bus services will be Uber's target. ""We believe we can continue to grow the number of trips taken with our ridesharing products and replace personal vehicle ownership and usage and public transportation, one use case at a time,"" the document explains. The latest ""strategy"" comes at a time when road transport corporations (RTCs) are in losses and lack government support. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), with losses soaring above Rs 700 crore, received a pittance in government aid. The government owes the four corporations Rs 1,080 crore as bus pass subsidy. The BMTC has written to the government requesting a ban on ridesharing services, Ola and Uber. ""The department says they have written to the Union government for its comment. Meanwhile, we are descending into losses,"" an official said. During the inauguration of Uber's office in the city, a company official had said that its operations would complement BMTC services. Vinay K Sreenivasa, a member of Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike, said it was clear that the growth strategies of companies such as Uber do not sit well with mobility strategies for cities like Bengaluru, where the idea is to have more people use public transport. ""It is time the government regulated these companies to ensure that their operations feed into the overall strategy to keep our cities sustainable. In the status quo, they are using the resources of our cities to make huge profits with no oversight,"" he said. Sreekumar K, head of Integrated Transport at the World Resources Institute, said governments should introduce regulations to create a level playing field for both private and corporate sectors. ""RTCs should improve efficiency by adopting the latest technology. The present route operations have led to BMTC buses competing with each other. The government should stop pushing them to make a profit,"" he said.Uber India did not respond to questions on the possible effects of their strategy on public transport in the country. ""Unfortunately, we won't be able to comment on the (matter) as of now,"" a spokesperson said."	BMTC,Uber,Public Transport,	 Apr 18 2019
With 2,000 BMTC buses on poll duty, services disrupted	travel within the city as disruptions in services forced them to look for last-minute alternatives.Of the 6,000 buses it operates, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) released 1,700 buses for election duty. Adding to this, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation borrowed another 200 buses on Tuesday.Though the number of people travelling during the three days is said to be less, those waiting on the platforms at the Kempegowda Metro Station, not to mention the crowds at bus stops, made it clear that the disruption has affected thousands.About 50 buses have been taken from each of the major depots like Yeshwantpur, Shanthinagar, Kengeri, Mysore Road and others. This has forced the depot managers to run services utilising available buses.“Of the 160 buses in the depot, 50 are on election duty. We have assessed routes with high demand during weekdays and weekends. We are distributing the existing resources. Trip plans have been drawn to ensure passengers are not inconvenienced,” a depot manager said.However, passengers spoke about the reduced number of trips. Devarajamma Nagappa, a flower vendor, said she waited at the Shankar Mutt for nearly two hours to catch a bus to Shivajinagar. “Buses usually come within half an hour. There is no bus even after one and half hours today and now I can’t board this,” she said, pointing at a crowded bus.Several persons aired their grievances on social media, including Twitter and Facebook. “@BMTC_BENGALURU what is the frequency of Volvo bus from manyata to silk board. From last few days people are waiting more than 30 min to get a bus specially from 5 pm to 7 pm,” Chinmaya Samal tweeted.The BMTC’s public relations staff did not respond to calls. However, an official said some disruption in service was unavoidable considering the number of buses on election duty. “We serve 38 lakh passengers. Minor disruptions will happen. Besides, many people have left the city for hometowns to vote,” he added.	General Elections 2019,BMTC,Lok Sabha Polls 2019,	 Apr 17 2019

OMBR residents get sewage-mixed water	"getting sewage water in their drinking water line, forcing them to buy water for the past 20 days. The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has been unable to find the source of this contamination and correct it. The board has also failed to provide free drinking water by tanker to the affected residents. Outraged residents say they would not cast their votes in the forthcoming elections, having been forced to spend up to Rs 1,200 for water. Prof Anthony Nirmal Raj, a resident of 2nd 'D' Cross, said residents noticed the dirty black and stinking water about four weeks ago and informed others. ""I've been calling BWSSB officials but they say they are on election duty,"" said Banaswadi Corporator A Kodanda Reddy. ""This is happening for the first time in 30 years."" Social worker Amith Nigli who resides in the area said the BWSSB did not inform residents about the contamination early on, as a result of which they were spending a fortune on cleaning up the sumps and overhead tanks. BWSSB executive engineer Chalapathy said the board was looking into the issue, assuring that the cleaning of the pipes was complete and drinking water would be restored. He held Bescom and private companies responsible for the issue. Water supply was restored to some households by late Tuesday evening."	water,OMBR Layout,Sewage,	 Apr 17 2019
Rooftop solar tool a ray of relief for consumers	in order to install a solar panel system of the right size, will be launched by the Bangalore Electricity Supply Corporation Limited (Bescom) after the elections.Crest Rooftop Evaluation for Solar Tool, has been developed by the CSTEP and has already been tested in Malleswaram on a 9 sqkm area.The corporation is now waiting for the model code of conduct to be lifted to implement it across the city. Trials were done in January and so far 50 consumers are already using the system available on the Bescom website.“The department has received over 200 requests from March. As of now, the delta version is being updated,” a senior Bescom official told DH.“We are ready to cover the 900 sqkm of the city. Consumer interactions and demonstrations have been held in Malleswaram. Feedback obtained from consumers has been incorporated and anomalies corrected,” the official added.Explaining how the tool works, the official said that consumers can know the exact measurement of their rooftop and the size of rooftop panel to be installed.Residents will also be able to know the capacity of their panels and the best angle. Consumers will be able to find experts for guidance and installers through the portal. “It will best suit apartments and small-scale industries as they are the ones having maximum difficulty in finding a place. It is also ideal for commercial spaces consuming a large amount of electricity and located in the middle of residential areas,” the official said.	Solar Panel,BESCOM,	 Apr 16 2019
Skywalk to link metro, rail stations at Yeshwantpur	be a hassle in the coming days as work is set to begin on a skywalk to connect the existing foot overbridge (FOB) of the railway station with a skywalk from the metro station. Much to the relief of thousands of passengers, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) is finalising details of the skywalk that will connect the existing FOB of the platform number 6 of the railway station.BMRCL Managing Director Ajay Seth on Friday held a meeting with officials of the South Western Railway’s Bengaluru division to get clearance for the project. “The divisional railway manager has extended support to the project. The railways has allowed us to construct the bridge,” he said. SWR officials said they had received a detailed proposal but sought changes in the design of the FOB to ensure the project will not come in conflict with their station development programme. Works have already begun to build a structure to provide canopy at the entrance of the station towards Tumakuru Road. Disputed landA stretch of disputed land between metro and railway stations has forced officials to adopt a cautious approach. “There has been no stay from the court. But I have told our officials to cross-check the same. We have already deposited the amount in court, which will be given to the owner as decided by the court,” the managing director said. About 10,000 passengers, most of them with heavy luggage, change between railway and metro stations at Yeshwantpur every day. Without a dedicated path, the walk on the 50-metre stretch between the stations is painful due to the barriers of the taxi lanes cutting across the way. The single FOB allowing direct connection is set to cost between Rs 3 crore and Rs 4 crore. Seth, however, said passenger convenience, not the cost of the project, was more important. “The cost is not significant. The skywalk will benefit thousands of people,” he added. The BMRCL had proposed the project back in 2016 but the railways had sought 7.47 crore for leasing the land for 35 years as well as maintenance and supervision of the bridge. In June 2018, BMRCL officials visited the spot after a DH report highlighted the lack of easy and safe access to the stations.	Namma Metro,skywalk,Yeshwantpur,	 Apr 13 2019
No need to white-top South End Road: PIL in HC	of South End Road from Madhavan Park to Nettakallappa Circle via Nagasandra Circle. A division bench of acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy and Justice Dinesh Kumar issued a notice to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on the petition filed by A C Chandrashekar and seven other residents of Basavanagudi. The petitioners want the court to stop the authorities from undertaking the white-topping of the said road in southern Bengaluru. The petitioners contended that the BBMP hadn’t come up with a scientific method for the white-topping of roads to provide for the smooth flow of rainwater or drainage water. No culverts have been built either. White-topping a road in an unscientific manner will result in uneven roads that will eventually hold water and damage the stretch, the residents stated and asserted that South End Road does not require white-topping. BBMP 'indifferent'What has especially upset the residents is the BBMP’s indifference to their representations. They said they had urged the civic body to stop the white-topping work but it paid no heed. The petitioners further pointed out that all the white-topping works being carried out by the BBMP are running behind schedule, and sought the court’s intervention to facilitate the conception of a scientific mechanism for white-topping. This would require: a. choosing the appropriate road, b. carrying out the work in a scientific manner and c. finishing the project on time by causing minimum inconvenience to the public. A nightmare for citizensThe BBMP’s white-topping projects have become a living nightmare for residents all over the city, causing traffic jams and resulting in dust problems.

HMT opens museum to showcase its journey	and museum in the city on Friday, showcasing its journey from a company making basic machines to manufacturing defence equipment.The museum seeks to tell HMT’s tale to the public, especially to the younger generation. “From humble beginnings in 1953, the HMT climbed a great height, and its story is also the story of India’s industrial revolution. We want the youth, who are more attracted to information technology, to see this,” said Santosh Deshpande, Joint General Manager (Administration and Public Relations) told DH.Once known as ‘jewel among the public sector’, the HMT had several subsidiary companies and had large stakes in companies spread across the country. Most of the units have now been closed, as the changing times have stopped even its sturdy wrist watches from ticking.Deshpande noted that recent developments can’t diminish the company’s contribution to India’s nation-building process. “HMT was once the leader in machine tools, from basic drilling machines to computerised ones as well as the automobile sector. We hope more people visit the museum and get inspired to take things further in basic engineering,” he said.The museum is situated amid the greenery of HMT Township in Jalahalli in the city. A children’s park, tractor joy ride, as well as a technical information centre, are part of the museum. It will be open from 10 am to 5 pm for the public throughout the week except on Tuesdays and national holidays.	HMT,Museum,	 Apr 13 2019
BMRCL to introduce common mobility card in second phase	is working on implementing the ambitious National Common Mobility Card system.The ‘One Nation One Card’ system, in effect, can be used to make payments for all public transport and will be linked to commuters’ bank accounts.The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has decided to introduce the common mobility card at all the 62 stations of Phase 2. BMRCL has finalised a contract worth Rs 148 crore.With this, the BMRCL is to phase out its smart cards gradually, while helping commuters get their common mobility card. The corporation is holding talks with banks and Bengaluru One in this regard.Ajay Seth, the BMRCL managing director, told DH that all gates at all 62 stations in Phase 2, will be ready to accept common mobility cards and the smart cards, when inaugurated in 2022. Initially, the gates will accept both common mobility cards and smart cards. “We are in the mobility business and have to facilitate smooth people movement,” Seth said.Meanwhile, the corporation will upgrade the existing Namma Metro gates with advanced tech as well.6 lakh smart cards “Around six lakh commuters already have smart cards and we cannot expect them to switch over immediately. But, eventually, the shift should happen and we are working towards that. Talks with other transport departments are also being held,” Seth added.BMRCL has set a deadline of two years from the start of Namma Metro Phase 2, for all smart card users to switch to the common mobility card. It is planning to set up kiosks and help desks in all stations. The corporation will gradually stop issuing smart cards so that people opt for the common mobility card instead. However, the choice will be left to the consumer, similar to what the banks are working towards.Interestingly, consumers have accepted the idea. Y G Muralidharan, founder trustee of Consumer Rights Education and Awareness Trust, said it was a good decision, as it is not right away imposed on people. “It is also not technologically possible to switch over immediately. There will be small aberrations, but people should absorb it for the larger interest of commuters. Meantime, BMRCL should ensure commuters are not burdened,” he said.

Apartments fined Rs 12L for not sorting trash	around eight wards in the city, that the civic body says are not adhering to waste segregation practices.“A total of Rs 12 lakh has been imposed as fine on 18 apartment complexes. The BBMP has penalised every individual house Rs 2000, that has violated the waste segregation norms,” said Manoranjan Hegde, BBMP’s chief health officer. The apartments have been given four days time to pay the penalties.The penalised apartments are in Hosakerehalli, Padmanabhanagar, Kumaraswamy Layout, Kempapura Agrahara, Ganesha Mandira, Yediyuru and Chikkalasandra wards. The BBMP had made mandatory the segregation of waste in all city households effective from February 1, 2017.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) conducted a spot inspection of the apartment complexes earlier this week and slapped fines for not segregating waste.Now, the residents are fuming over the hefty fines. BBMP’s totally unexpected move on apartments barring individual houses has raised eyebrows. Some of the apartment complexes in Kumaraswamy Layout have been imposed a penalty of Rs 1.5 lakh, according to a BBMP notification. “Our housekeeping staff segregate waste at source. Sometimes they do accidentally mix plastic with wet waste. But they fix it before the waste is moved to wet and dry waste bins. BBMP officials who came for the spot inspection thought the waste is dumped in the bins without segregation. They imposed penalties with no specific indication as to why the fine is Rs 1.5 lakh. This is too much to pay,” said Anitha Udupa, a resident of Pramukh Temple Meadows.“BBMP’s approach displays a lack of transparency. Choosing apartments that have adhered to guidelines and slapping them with fines for flimsy reasons is ridiculous. The BBMP should engage with the residents to jointly tackle the solid waste management crisis,” said Vikram Rai, treasurer and SWM lead, Bangalore Apartments’ Federation.Residents say the BBMP should also check on individual houses.“It is the duty of the Solid Waste Management (SWM) department to check individual houses. We, medical officers, focus only on bulk generators like apartments. We would love to check on individual houses too and create awareness about segregation. But we are not allowed to do that,” said a BBMP official.BBMP had called a meeting with the representatives of the apartments on Saturday to discuss issues pertaining to waste segregation and resolution.

JP Nagar road turns into garbage dump	in a mess. And there is no better illustration of this than the scene in 18th Main, JP Nagar.Thanks to the BBMP’s apathy, the area around JP Nagar Club, 18th Main, has virtually got converted into a garbage mound infested with swarms of mosquitoes.According to residents of JP Nagar Phase 2, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) solid waste management contractors are segregating waste on a road that is close to two schools, the club and a temple. They said the BBMP had turned a deaf ear to their complaints about the problem.“There is a park for senior citizens in the area. The rubbish dump has turned into a nightmare for them as it stinks. Every day, around 20 garbage vehicles come to the spot and dump waste. Senior citizens and children are suffering from lung diseases,” said Krishna, a resident.He said that even animals were also suffering, with cows eating the waste. “The black spot has also given rise to stray dog menace in the area,” he said.Uma Balakrishna, another resident of JP Nagar, said BBMP officials pleaded helplessness with them, with the civic body stating that they had to do the segregation on the road as they had no other place.“But the waste is spilling on the road and causing trouble to move vehicles. If the palike picks up waste on time, I think we can at least get rid of the stench,” said Uma.Strangely, local Corporator KN Lakshmi Nataraj cited closure of Mandur landfill as the reason for turning the road into a garbage dump. “We are also helpless. The waste can move from the spot once the Mandur landfill is open,” she said.	waste disposal,BBMP,JP Nagar,	 Mar 29 2019
BMRCL Tumakuru Rd U-turn: FOB chosen over subways	safe access to metro stations at Nagasandra and Dasarahalli metro stations, the BMRCL has decided to do away with the plan to build subways as officials are now planning to build foot overbridges (FOB) instead.It has been nearly four years since the metro began chugging till Nagasandra in May 2015. However, commuters risk their lives every day while crossing the busy Tumakuru road to reach the metro stations at Dasarahalli and Nagasandra.Several people have suffered injuries and at least three have been killed after being hit by speeding vehicles at Nagasandra metro station. At Dasarahalli, the traffic signals have failed to provide easy and safe crossover access to pedestrians walking to the metro station.The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) finally woke up to the problem and invited tenders for building subways at both the metro stations. A previous tender called in April 2018 was cancelled. The work was awarded in September last year after officials spent months to get clearances from the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).However, six months down the line, officials have now sent a proposal for building a foot overbridge in front of both the stations instead. The BMRCL did not respond to a detailed query, but sources said the subway project was dropped recently.“Preliminary works like soil testing were completed some time ago. However, during a high-level meeting recently, it was felt that the FOBs are a better solution since they are safer than subways at night, especially for women,” an official said.Subhash Shetty, a resident of Nagasandra, said the news has come as a rude shock for residents.“They wasted three years before finalising the subway projects. Now, they have gone back to square one. People are dying while crossing the roads and now they say they are rethinking on the project. We will bring this to the notice of the leaders who come asking for votes,” said Shetty, also a member of ward committee.However, a BMRCL official contended that the FOB will serve the commuters better and will be a reality sooner than the subway.“It takes about two years to build a subway, but a FOB can be built in six months. Tenders will be called once the NHAI approves the proposal,” he said.	Dasarahalli,BMRCL,Nagasandra,metro,	 Mar 29 2019
Trash is sustainable at Saahas, a city enterprise	a day, a local waste-processing firm says it has proved the old dictum — one’s waste can be another’s treasure.“Bengaluru has a big problem of trash, but what most people don’t realise is the segregation and recycling of trash can be sustainable ventures which can not only solve the city’s massive garbage problem but also help in the social mobility of the city’s rag-pickers, who are unsung heroes of this story. Because it is they who are unwittingly formalising the segregation of garbage in the city,” said Preet Prakash Khatri, the manager at Saahas Zero Waste Management Private Limited’s Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in Jigani.While the entire Saahas network collects nearly 45 tons of waste from the city a day for segregation, processing and transport to recycling companies elsewhere, the organisation’s MRF in Jigani handles dry-waste from nearly all the IT parks in the city and other multinational corporations.“Nearly 70% of our dry-waste collection is from IT companies, and the rest is from apartments, gated communities and schools,” Khatri said, adding that if 10 tons of garbage is collected everyday, seven tons are collected as part of the zero-waste programme, which aims for maximum recyclability.Trash is procured from bulk waste generators through a service-free model or from informal waste workers who are paid for the waste they collect. The workers are trained to become entrepreneurs. The segregated waste is then sold to recycling companies who can expect to turn a profit through recycling.“Through this way, waste segregation is brought in the ambit of a proper business model,” Khatri said.N S Ramakanth, a founding member of the BBMP’s Solid Waste Management Round Table praised the role of private organisations such as Saahas, helping to tackle the waste problem. But he cautioned that private enterprises alone cannot solve it.“Private companies do not have the sanction to carry out door-to-door collection unless they are properly organised,” he said.Ramakanth nevertheless pointed out the successes of the round table when it came to trash collection during events, especially at the Indian Premier League cricket matches, whose organisers had initially refused to cooperate, claiming it was impossible to make a crowd of 60,000 people segregate their waste at the stadium.“We did not take no for an answer, and backed by the BBMP officials, we are seeing to it that they are maintaining discipline.”In fact, local BBMP involvement is a must if segregated garbage collection is to work in the city, Ramakanth added.	waste management,	 Mar 28 2019
Govt’s only flight school turning students away	School, Jakkur — is facing a severe staff crunch. This has created a huge backlog in student intake.Now, the institute is turning students away. The lone instructor at the institute has been holding meetings with the government since 2015 to hire more trainers, but in vain.Thanks to the backlog, the school has decided entrance exams will be held only once a year. Till the last academic year (2018), entrance exams were held through the year. The minimum qualification will continue to be class 12.This is the only state-run flight school in Karnataka. There is another in Mysuru, but private.Since last seven years there has been just a chief flying instructor at the school — retired Wing Commander Amarjeet Singh Dange. There is also one ground attendant to assist Dange.Wg Cdr Dange said: “I put a request to the government in 2015 to hire more staff and increase the wages, so that more can apply. But the request is still pending. So, now we have decided to be stricter on the intake.”In the last seven years, of the 48 students, only six have completed the course and have got licences. Training of four students will be completed by August.The institute receives over 12 applications everyday. But now, whenever inquiries are made, the institute is diverting students to other private institutes.Captain Amar Nath, who runs a private ground training institute in the city, acknowledged the shortage of trainers and said the existing ones are overburdened.Students who approach private institutes are given ground training in India and are then sent abroad for flight training.Meanwhile, officials at the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports said: “There is a shortage of pilots across India and it is a matter of concern. It is being discussed with the ministry and the government and a decision is yet to be taken.”	Flying school,Jakkur,	 Mar 28 2019

Flyover work stalled over dues to contractor	on the Sirsi Circle flyover, resulting in traffic woes.Motorists are frustrated over the slow pace and extended deadlines, since just one side of the road from Town Hall to Mysuru Road is open and work on the other side is kept pending for the past two months.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike began asphalting of the flyover last December.The Sirsi Circle flyover, also called the Bala Gangadhara Swami flyover, links Mysuru Road with the city centre and was the first-ever flyover to be built. The civic body hoped to complete the work on Mysuru Road to Town Hall by March 15.“The BBMP hasn’t repaired the stretch for the past one month,” said Santhosh Kumar, a resident of Rajarajeshwari Nagar.“The delay is causing traffic snarls on the stretch. It is scary to ride near the City Market, where slabs on the flyover wobble whenever there’s heavy vehicular movement,” Kumar said. The BBMP is resurfacing the flyover at a cost of Rs 4 crore, the second time the work is taken up since 1999. The repairs done in 2012 lasted for just five years, as potholes and wobbling joints have made the flyover a potential accident spot in recent times.What the BBMP has to say BBMP engineer Chandrashekhar said work on the other stretch could not begin due to outstanding payments to the contractors. “The BBMP accounts section must sanction the payment of the pending amount to the contractor. The amount may be sanctioned by April and work will begin soon,” he added.	Sirsi Circle flyover,BBMP,	 Mar 28 2019
Key Metro lines dropped for elevated corridor project?	line truncated to make way for elevated corridors on the two stretches? The 17.10 km East-West Corridor-2 from Richmond Circle to Varthur passes almost entirely along the 21-km Metro Phase 3 line initially proposed by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL).The Hoskerehalli-Marathahalli line was designed to cater mainly to areas on either side of Old Airport Road. Currently, none of the Metro lines or suburban railways passes through this highly congested stretch.First proposed to the Urban Development Ministry in May 2016, this Phase 3 line did not find mention in the 2018-19 state budget. Another line from Yelahanka to Carmelaram was truncated from Iblur to Carmelaram.Besides Marathahalli on its eastern end, the proposed Metro line to Hoskerehalli was to serve HAL, Konena Agrahara, Murugeshpalya, Domlur, Command Hospital, D’Souza Circle, Vellara Junction and Town Hall (new interchange station with the Cameralaram-Yelahanka line).Further ahead, the line would touch K R Market (interchange station with the existing green line), R K Ashram, Srinivas Nagar, and Seetha Circle before reaching Hoskerehalli on the Outer Ring Road.The Hoskerehalli-Marathahalli line was part of a BMRCL presentation on five Phase 3 lines reviewed by the Ministry of Urban Development. Engineering consultancy firm, RITES had been engaged to prepare the pre-feasibility study for each of these lines over the next nine months. A detailed project report (DPR) was to be ready in 18 months.However, before anything moved on Metro Phase 3, the controversial pod taxi project was proposed along the same route.Now, that the taxi project has been effectively shelved, the Elevated Corridor project has surfaced as a definite Metro killer on the stretch.Another proposed Phase 3 Metro line, from Yelahanka to Carmelaram would also have come into direct conflict with the North-South corridor from Hebbal to Silk Board junction.This 32-km Metro line had its alignment marked through Hebbal, Mehkri Circle, Guttahalli, Chalukya Circle, Central College, Town Hall, Poornima Talkies, Shanthinagar, Dairy Circle, Forum Mall, Koramangala water tank, Agara, Iblur, Wipro and Carmelaram along Sarjapur Road.Strangely, the two lines which were in the Phase 3 pipeline for years, disappeared when the government cleared a proposal to prepare the DPR for Phase 3 in its 2017-18 budget.Neither the 2018-19 budget nor the recent budget presented by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy made mention of the lines, critical for central business district (CBD) mass mobility.Urban mobility analysts are wondering why an elevated corridor project was being preferred over Metro lines in the CBD area.	elevated corridor project,Namma Metro,Bengaluru,	 Mar 27 2019
HC slams BBMP over KR Market illegal shops	"for failing to comply with the fire safety guidelines and allowing illegal construction of shops in KR Market.A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice L Narayana Swamy directed the BBMP commissioner to be present before the court on Wednesday.The court was hearing a petition filed by the flower merchants’ association and others who have challenged the setting up of illegal stalls in the public passage and fire exit areas of the KR Market to the extent of disrupting air flow that may lead to fire incidents.The petitioners contended that 95 fire accidents have already taken place in the market area. It orally observed: "" Why were illegal complexes being permitted to be set up and who is responsible for the same? What is the action taken against them? And what are the steps you would take to prevent construction illegal buildings?""The court also directed the commissioner to make a statement with regard to illegal construction of shops in the markets run by the corporation particularly, Russell Market, KR Market and Madivala Market and the steps taken to demolish alleged illegal shops in these markets.It sought to know as to how were illegal complexes permitted to be set up and who was responsible for the same. What is the action taken against them? The case was adjourned to Wednesday."	Bengaluru,BBMP,KR Market,	 Mar 27 2019

BBMP to launch animal rescue ambulances	rescue ailing and injured animals, with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike scheduled to introduce it after the elections.The civic body has set aside Rs 25 lakh to buy three ambulances to launch the service, which animal lovers can summon by contacting the BBMP control room.“Once the call (to the control room) is made, the ambulance will dash off to pick up the animal and take it to the nearest veterinary clinic or animal birth control centres for first aid and pain relief,” a BBMP official said.Rescue efforts will be focused mostly on urban strays like dogs, cats and monkeys. The ambulance will be equipped with surgical instruments, sterilisers and support tools to treat the animals.“Many stray animals in the city die untreated during an emergency. The animal ambulance will be useful, particularly for accidents occurring in the odd hours on the city roads,” the official added.The BBMP is also planning to train the staff in the ambulance to give first aid and life-saving drugs to the animals on the spot. The officials are planning to extend the services to pet dogs or ruminants in emergencies.	BBMP,ambulance,	 Mar 25 2019
Yarn bank set up to help weavers in crisis	Mysore Powerloom Silk Manufacturers Cooperative Society on Avenue Road to benefit the state’s weavers.The weavers are reeling under severe shortage and fluctuating prices of yarn. The new yarn bank comes as a huge relief for thousands of weavers in and around Bengaluru. The bank, regardless of the price rise in the open market and the menace of middlemen, ensures a steady supply of yarn to the weavers from southern Karnataka.The bank, with aid from the Centre, will supply pure silk yarn and zari to weavers who subscribe. Currently, the weavers have to source yarn locally through agents and wholesalers.“It was a daunting task for weavers as the brokers rigged prices. Adding to the woes, rising costs of cotton and related petrochemicals left the prices fluctuating,” explained M Lakshminarayana, president of the cooperative society.The bank will purchase yarn at the wholesale rate from producers with a corpus instituted by the Centre and a special purpose vehicle (SPV). “All the subscribing weavers will be provided yarn at reasonable rates to sustain production,” he said. The power loom industry supplies about 60% of the cloth requirement at the national level. Karnataka has about 1,20,000 power looms weaving silk and cotton. Most power looms are based in Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural and Tumakuru districts, with only a few in northern Karnataka.While the bank, the first-of-its-kind in Karnataka, sources its yarn from various sources, art silk is imported from China.Besides, a considerable quantity of yarn is procured from Surat and Mumbai too. Considering the requirement of silk saree weavers, yarn from traditional markets like Ramanagara and Channapatna are also procured.According to the society, several weavers have already registered at the bank. They are now benefiting from a steady and timely supply of yarn.	Silk Farmers,Karnataka,	 Mar 25 2019
GAIL pipeline leak creates tension at Electronic City	began leaking from the GAIL pipeline in AECS Layout on Sunday evening.Fire and emergency officials rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control after an hour. Senior fire officials said residents of Haraluru Road near Singasandra had called the fire control room around 7 pm as they heard noise and noticed fire break out from the GAIL pipeline.In recent times, civic authorities were responsible for causing fire accidents by digging up places where the GAIL pipeline is laid underground, though they are expected to consult a coordination committee before engaging in such works. Their continued negligence would only result in a major disaster in future, the police warned.Last month, four children were injured when a Bescom contractor damaged a GAIL pipeline at Muneshwara Block in Naganathapura near Parappana Agrahara.

Diagnostic lab cries foul after biomedical waste fine	disposal rules created a fresh controversy on Saturday. Citing unscientific disposal of biomedical waste, BBMP officials imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on Focus Diagnostics and Speciality Clinic, Rajajinagar. The lab not only cried foul but also accused BBMP officials of mixing biomedical waste with the general waste. In a press release, Dr A S Balasundar, Health Officer, BBMP, West Zone, said: “We had received a complaint that this diagnostic centre was unscientifically disposing of the biomedical waste. Upon checking, the centre was found to be violating the rules as it was disposing of the biomedical waste along with the regular waste. We have fined it Rs 1 lakh under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.” Lab rejects claimThe lab rejected the BBMP’s claim and said it had been duly following the rules ever since its inception. “We have an agreement with biomedical waste handlers and have been handing them over the waste scientifically. But BBMP personnel haven’t collected the regular waste from the hospital in the past 15-days despite our repeated requests,” Rathnakar Hegde, Managing Director, Focus Diagnostics, told DH. He accused BBMP officials of demanding Rs 1,000 a month to collect the regular waste as against the mutually agreed upon payment of Rs 500. “When we refused to oblige, they added biomedical waste to the regular waste and fined us,” he claimed. Dr Balasundar refuted the lab’s accusations, calling them “far from the truth”. “We have all the evidence, including documents and photographs, to show that the lab was not disposing of the biomedical waste scientifically,” he said.	biomedical waste,BBMP,	 Mar 24 2019
White-topping woes leave Shanthinagar in a mess	is worsening by the day. Now, the case in point is the work taken up near the Shanthinagar bus terminal.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has blocked the stretch towards Dairy Circle without providing an alternative road.Recently, the BBMP dumped construction material in the area for laying the concrete road. The work on BTS Main Road started about five months ago but is yet to wrap up.The civic body officials said the slow pace of execution is due to the shifting of underground drainage pipelines (UGDs).Prabhakaran, a regular commuter, said: “The work is moving at a snail’s pace. The traffic on this stretch has increased now. During peak hours, when there is a movement of buses, it is very difficult to ride. Two-wheelers may skid and fall. I have witnessed such instances myself.”“Commuting during peak hours on this stretch is hellish. Many of us are forced to take diversions repeatedly to avoid such traffic. But, we still end up spending a lot of additional time on the road,” Mahendra Kumar, a resident of Shantinagar, complained. “We will complete the project soon.

Depleting green cover, a grey area of concern	to surrender the last vestiges of its once green heritage? As the development brigade marches on with its concrete monster projects of dubious utility, here comes an alarming piece of statistics: By 2025, grey will dominate 98.5% of the city’s landscape.Tracking the city’s dangerous descent into climatic chaos for decades, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) should know what it is in store. Years ago, its arresting imagery of eight Bengaluru maps from 1973 to 2020 had shocked everyone. The 1973 map, with its 68.2% green expanse had morphed into a ‘built-up’ mosaic of 78.7% red by 2017.But this will not prick the conscience of the bull-dozers, ready to chop down over 3,500 trees for an elevated corridor project that aids none but the car-owners. On the chopping line are 120 Cubbon Park trees, even if the corridor beku brigade contends that the Queen’s Road median is outside the park boundary.A 1998 government notification had clearly defined the Park’s boundary as up to and along the Queen’s Road and Kasturba Road. The stress on ‘along’ meant the medians were part of the park, and nobody had the right to construct anything there without the Karnataka High Court’s consent. A 2001 court ruling had ratified the boundary notification, clearing all doubts.The potent threat to Cubbon Park is an arresting symbol of a deeper, far bigger malaise: An ostrich-like disregard to the wanton destruction of Bengaluru’s green heritage. The demolition continues when citizen activists, environmentalists and institutions, the IISc in particular, have left the warning bells continuously ringing.Critical green rolesLandscapes with tree cover, reminds Dr T V Ramachandra from IISc’s Centre for Ecological Sciences, recharges the groundwater, moderates the micro climate, sequesters the carbon emitted in urban environment, maintaining the natural balance.In 2016, a study led by Dr Ramachandra had conclusively established this: Bengaluru witnessed an astounding 1005% increase in paved surfaces. This coincided with a deeply troubling 88% decline in green spaces and 79% drop in water spread regions.Overlaying the administrative boundaries of 198 BBMP wards on the vegetation distribution maps from 1973 to 2012 revealed an interesting trend: The least vegetation cover (less than 1 hectare) was found in Chickpete, Shivajinagara, Kempapura agrahara, Padarayanapura and surrounding areas.Highest vegetationVarthur, Bellandur and Agaram wards had the highest vegetation cover (of over 300 ha). In quantitative terms, wards such as Varthuru, Bellanduru, Agaram, Aramane Nagara had over 40,000 trees. Chickpete, Padarayanapura, Shivajinagara, Kempapura Agrahara, and Kushalnagara wards had less than 100 trees.But is this slide irreversible? Hardly so, say IISc scientists. They have proof right inside their campus: A mini forest raised from 500 saplings of 49 native species, planted in the 1990s. “The groundwater table that was as deep as 150ft now stands at 10-15 ft. The temperature inside the miniforest is at least two degrees lower than the surrounding area,” informs Dr Ramachandra.Scaling upCan this be replicated and scaled up for the rest of the city? Yes, if one to two hectares of land is set aside for such miniforests in every ward. “When the government can acquire land for elevated corridor and similar projects, they should find land for this as well.”For the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), afforestation is all about planting saplings. Earlier this month, the Palike unveiled one such plan to plant one lakh saplings across its eight zones with support from various Non Governmental Organisations.Sapling responseThe Palike’s Deputy Conservator of Forests, M K Cholarajappa informs that the saplings are ready at BBMP’s four nurseries. Tenders have been finalised for 75,000 saplings. A sum of Rs 5 crore was earmarked in the recent budget for the project.Native species are often preferred for the saplings, those valued for timber, honge and mahogany. The Palike, he says, will also make available hole dasavala, huvarasi, sampige, basavana pada, tabebuia, jacaranda and tabebuia guayacan. Also figuring in the list are fruit-bearing trees kadu badami, jamun, gooseberry, cherry and medicinal trees such as neem, simarouba and tapasi.The saplings could take years or even decades to offer a canopy anywhere near the fully grown trees being felled for multiple projects. But what about the green behemoths that disappear without a trace from official records?Tree trackingTo digitally track the city’s tree cover and keep a tab on every tree, Bengaluru’s tree doctor Vijay Nishant had recently launched a tree census in Jayanagar. The objective is simple: To develop a verifiable database of trees, freely accessible in the public domain. As Nishant notes, this will help citizens and all stake-holders keep a strong vigil on indiscriminate tree-felling.The tree census might help call the bluff on planting claims. But, as Harini Nagendra, professor of Sustainability, Azim Premji University, points out, a qualitative analysis of the trees being planted is critical in the long-term.Species matterTrees are planted for shade, promotion of bio-diversity and reduction in air pollution. The choice of plants should reflect these objectives. “The old trees, tamarind, mango, banyan and the raintrees, had a lot of canopy. Our studies in recent years show a lot of honge and neem trees are preferred now while the old species are abandoned,” notes Harini.She cautions that this fixation with only a few species could lead to mono-culture. “In case of any pest attack, for instance, the entire lot can get wiped out. The need of the hour: A judicious mix.”	Bengaluru,green cover,	 Mar 23 2019
Artificial 'floating islands' clean Madiwala Lake	'floating islands' in Madiwala Lake, one of the oldest lakes in Bengaluru's southern section.A report by the Bangalore Mirror describes these islands as raft-like structures that are built with PVC and PET bottles as the frame and mesh and coir as the actual body. The 'islands' are fitted with plants that absorb chemicals like nitrates from the water, reducing their concentration.The KFD decided to adopt this technique after seeing several examples of it being used to clean waterbodies around the world. The benefits of these 'islands' includes helping control algae bloom by means of absorbing the nutrients that come into waterbodies through sewage. In addition, these can act as resting grounds for birds, low-cost and are easy to maintain.In Bengaluru, Puttenahalli and Hebbagodi lakes have been exposed to this form of treatment and have responded well to it, the report states, quoting Harshavardhan, Additional Conservator of Forest, Bengaluru Urban Division.The WWF is also part of the initiative and they have conducted extensive research on the quality of water in the lake and the birds that frequent it.The report says the plants used in the 'islands' are Typha and Canna, two genera of flowering plants, to absorb the nutrients. The KFD is responsible for maintaining the islands and is planning on extending this program to other lakes.	Water Pollution,Madiwala lake,forest department,	 Mar 23 2019
How's the jog? Damaged track at Lalbagh repaired	"along the Lalbagh Lake adjacent to the RV Teachers College corner. This comes as a relief to thousands of walkers and joggers who frequent the botanical gardens inconvenienced for several months now. The problem was reported by several citizens during Janaspandana — a citizen interaction programme organised by DH and Prajavani in November 2018. Besides repairing the damaged track, the department directed the contractors to keep the public toilets open as early as 5.30 am for the convenience of hundreds of regulars who flock to the park early in the morning. Speaking to DH, Chandrashekhar M R, deputy director, Lalbagh, said that all measures have been taken to ensure cleanliness in the park. M Jagadeesh, joint director (parks and public gardens), Horticulture Department, said: ""Repair of damaged roads within Lalbagh requires funds to the tune of Rs 3 crore besides administrative approval by the director. As the director who recently took over the charge is busy with the electoral process, we are unable to finalise it. Soon after the polls, a suitable decision will be taken in this regard."" Polls defer vehicle ban For making Lalbagh a ""walkers' paradise"" and adding to the list of green initiatives, the department had proposed enforcing a ban on the movement of vehicles inside the park. The plan was given approval in principle by Horticulture Minister M C Managuli and the previous horticulture director. Though the department had set a deadline of a month and a half to implement the proposal, the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha polls has come in the way. ""It was decided to ban the movement of vehicles one-and-a-half-months ago. But as all officials including our new director Dr M V Venkatesh are busy with the electoral process, we have deferred the decision until the completion of the polls,"" another senior official told DH. The department has also replaced the old welcome signage at the West Gate, besides setting up a new ticketing counter. According to the officials, during the Janaspandana event, the visitors urged the department to replace the structures."	Jogging Track,Horticulture Department,Lalbagh Botanical Gardens,	 Mar 20 2019
KSR rail station to get 5 more escalators	more escalators to the foot overbridge, linking all platforms. Railway officials had called tenders for installing five escalators at KSR Bengaluru and one at Yeshwantpur with April 4 as the deadline. The successful bidder will also be responsible for annual maintenance for three years which will commence after the two-year guarantee period.The KSR Bengaluru station, which has an annual footfall of about 2.8 crores, is also connected to the city railway metro station. At present, the foot overbridge has single escalators connecting the 10 platforms which are programmed to climb. The five escalators, whose overall cost is estimated at Rs 2.41 crore, are likely to provide an option for easy descent from the bridge. The Yeshwantpur station, which will soon see an annual footfall of 1 crore and has four escalators, will get another at a cost of Rs 48 lakh.	Krantivira Sangolli Rayanna railway station,	 Mar 18 2019
Traffic snarls at Kundalahalli Junction set to worsen	Bengaluru, owing to the construction of the underpass, may worsen in the coming days, the traffic police have warned. Commuters were quite taken aback by the four-lane underpass work that kick-started two months ago as it began unannounced.The project was proposed a decade ago, as part of a signal-free corridor to ease traffic jams at the junction.But now, the construction has turned into a nightmare to those frequenting the area with the commuting time stretching to 90 minutes on an average.According to traffic personnel, the traffic congestion is likely to increase once the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) starts building an island for underpass construction at the junction in coming months.The junction may turn too congested with the presence of barricades and supporting structures. “We may have to close the road for some days,” said Siddalingappa, assistant commissioner of police, overseeing the project. “But we will provide the best alternative routes for commuters to ensure smooth flow of traffic,” he added.The vehicles moving towards and from Varthur Kodi slow down at the junction due to construction.The alternate roads are not commuter-friendly at the moment, said Siddalingappa. “The BBMP should asphalt some of the alternate roads in Panathur and Chinnappanahali leading to Bellandur Outer Ring Road and Sarjapur Road. They are in the worst condition at present. Also, some of the suggested alternate roads are quite lengthy,” he added.Some citizens are collaborating with the BBMP, MLA Arvind Limbavali and Bangalore Traffic Police to find solutions for the traffic chaos. One of the bus stops at Kundalahalli Junction was removed on Sunday, to expand the road so that more space is created for vehicles.“There is another bus stop as an alternative to the one removed recently. The commuters are using that,” said Clement C Jayakumar, a Doddanekundi resident.Meanwhile, BBMP officials said they are in the process of restoring some alternate routes, but the work has been slowed down due to elections.Alternative roads From Varthur Road to Thubarahalli via Outer Ring RoadFrom Varthur Kodi to Varthur, Gunjur, Chikkabellandur, Carmelaram via Sarjapur RoadFrom HAL main road to Yemalur, Bellandur Kere Kodi, Kariyammana Agrahara via ORRFrom HAL Main Road to Railway Parallel Road, Chinnappanahalli, Doddanekundi Industrial Area and heading towards ITPBAlpine Eco road from Graphite India Main road to ORR Rainbow Hospital JunctionGoshala road through Garudacharpalaya	Kundalahalli Gate,traffic congestion,	 Mar 18 2019
Farmers demand Rs 1,500 cr in dues for KG Layout land	a standstill as farmers have been staging a protest since Friday. So far, not more than 30% of the civil works have been completed.The farmers are demanding compensation from the government for their land acquired for the residential colony. Over 400 farmers are agitating against the BDA, demanding due compensation, pending to the tune of around Rs 1,500 crore.Agitating farmers chased away the contractors on Friday night. Since Saturday morning, they are guarding their land.The protesters have divided themselves into groups comprising about a 100 each. They are keeping round-the-clock vigil. They say they will not allow any work until the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) sort out the matter.BDA earmarked 4,043.27 acres of land between Mysuru Road and Magadi Road for the layout, which falls in the Yeshwantpur assembly constituency. BDA Chairman S T Somashekhar is the MLA from Yeshwantpur.In the first and second phase, BDA allotted 5,000 sites to allottees. BDA had also announced to accommodate 4,000 allottees of Arkavathi Layout.Channappa, a farmer who owns three acres of land in Kensinapura, said BDA was to give farmers Rs 80 lakh or 9,583 sq ft of land as compensation for every acre acquired. But, the BDA gave only acquisition notices. So until the compensation is given, the land belongs to farmers.“We submitted a memorandum to the BDA chairman and commissioner on Saturday. They tried to pacify us, but we are not convinced. We told them officials are demanding a bribe to move our files. We will not part with our land unless we get due compensation,” he said.However, site allottees said their suffering will only increase because of the tussle between farmers and the BDA. They fear this layout will also become like Arkavathi Layout, which has not been realised even after 12 years. Kempegowda Layout is the first layout to be formed after Arkavathi Layout.Surya Kiran, an allottee said: “First phase allottees have already been given bank notices for failing to start construction on their sites. They were given sites in 2016. We were unable to construct because there are no facilities available. Thanks to the ongoing tussle, it will take longer, which means we will suffer financial losses.”Somashekhar, meanwhile, said issues have cropped up due to financial irregularities and the matter will be looked into.

Poll code not an excuse to delay ad bylaws: HC to govt	Sabha elections will not affect finalising the advertising bylaws, the high court told the state government.The court issued the direction after the government attributed the delay in preparing the draft BBMP outdoor signage and public messaging bylaws to the election code. It was hearing a public interest litigation petition asking its directions to remove hoardings and posters.The court also told the government that it is giving a final chance to finish the draft bylaws by next week.The court also allowed the BBMP to permit polling stations, banks, hospitals, schools and other places to display posters for election campaigns. This follows the filing of an affidavit by the BBMP, asking the court’s permission to display poll advertisements after it received a letter from the Election Commission of India.

Apex court admits plea against NGT order to freeze PRR	Authority’s plea, challenging the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order, freezing the 65-km, eight-lane ring road project based on a five-year-old environmental clearance.While orally observing that the project would be important for the city’s growing traffic needs, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta said the court would examine if a fresh green clearance is needed.It posted the matter for detailed hearing on April 1 and issued notices to Sudhakar Hegde and others, whose plea prompted the NGT to freeze the project last month.‘Indefinitely stayed’Appearing for the BDA, advocates Shyam Divan and Sanjay M Nuli said the tribunal had “indefinitely stayed” the entire Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) phase 1 project proponent until a fresh environmental impact assessment is obtained.This, they said, would result in cost escalations from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 12,000 crore. The PRR phase 1 connects Tumakuru Road with Hosur Road, cutting through Ballari Road and Old Madras Road.Appearing for Hegde and others, advocate Nikhil Nayar said the project should have been completed within three years of the granting of the environmental clearance. He said the NGT had noted five years of delay and refused to allow the project on the basis of the previous environment impact assessment.The BDA council said a decision has been made to realign the petroleum pipeline and fresh land is provided for trees.The state government said the road was planned to address Bengaluru’s need for faster vehicular commutation, decongest existing roads and to connect the Bangalore-Mysore Infrastructure Corridor (NICE Road) with more access points.

IISc introduces e-rickshaw service on campus	sprawling 350-acre campus in the heart of Bengaluru, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) would introduce e-rickshaws.The fleet of 10 e-rickshaws will be launched on Saturday under the banner ‘Pick-E-Rick’ ahead of the Open Day celebrations scheduled later this month.IISc’s administrative officials believe e-rickshaws would bring down the use of motorised vehicles inside its campus. “The idea has been tested since last year and three rickshaws have been in use,” said a senior official of the institute. “Following the success of the idea, it would be offered full-time across the campus for easy commute.”The rickshaws could be hired by faculty, students and others visiting the campus for Rs 5 per trip per person.An official release from the institute stated that the rickshaws will operate on five different routes identified as purple, green, red, orange and blue by Prof Ashish Verma’s Transportation Engineering Lab at IISc.The rickshaws will be available on all days, except Sundays, between 11.30 am and 7.30 pm. Operated by Transvahan Technologies India, it will accept only digital payments. “Each way along the chosen route will cost Rs 5. Commuters must pay digitally by apps like UPI or Paytm,” the official said.	Indian Institute of Science,E-rickshaw,	 Mar 16 2019
BWSSB connection? Not interested, say residents	Sewerage (BWSSB) services are indispensable for living in the city. But people of 110 villages newly added to the BBMP beg to differ.Citizens have spurned the BWSSB’s offer of bringing them under its ambit. Of the 35,000 families, only 6,000 in 29 villages have applied for connections till date.The BWSSB has so far completed the underground drainage (UGD) work and the infrastructure is in place to provide water supply in about 29 villages.BWSSB officials said they had notified about the provision of water supply to citizens and called for their applications. The notifications were sent to people in 7 out of 29 villages in August last year, 12 received notifications in November and 10 received in January this year.But, hardly 6,000 people have showed interest in the BWSSB’s water connections, thanks to bureaucratic red-tape that accompanies any government service. And with villagers enjoying the luxury of free borewell water in some villages, there seems to be no incentive for residents to clamour for connections. Losing trustThe civic body has already trust of the residents by failing to arrange water tankers on time. “If phoned today, the BWSSB water tankers reach our houses after two days. What is the point in attending to people’s crisis but not on time? We are totally dependent on private tankers for water, who are throwing hefty prices at us,” said Shashikala from Bommanahalli area.Diwakar DV, a resident from Bellandur, said residents cannot rely on BWSSB tankers even though they are cheaper than private tankers because of irregular timings. “Many office-goers cannot depend on BWSSB tankers as they delay too much,” he said.Kempararamiah, Engineer-in-Chief, BWSSB, admitted the problem with water tanker supply. “It has not come to our notice that the tankers are not reaching the respective houses in time. I will talk to our concerned engineers in charge of this and make sure the supply is proper and on time,” he said. The BBMP said it would deploy 267 water tankers to serve villages without water supply. “We have issued a one week tender for the same. We will provide water wherever there is a need,” said Manjunath Prasad, BBMP commissioner.	BWSSB,	 Mar 16 2019
READ: Reports on the proposed elevated corridor project	to another and decongest the roads choked with vehicles, the state government floated a tender for an elevated corridor just a few days before the announcement of the Lok Sabha elections. The decision to build the elevated corridor has left the city divided with pro and con debates reaching a new crescendo.Activists have alleged that the project all along its path will cut down trees, demolish heritage structures and pave the way for even more traffic in the days to come. Even though the government has conveyed that it will consider the opinion of all sections of society, the decision to float a tender unilaterally has drawn flak from various quarters. DH has accessed reports on the project.

No end to white-topping woes, RV Road works start	(Lalbagh West Gate) to Banashankari TTMC beginning today, may result in further traffic chaos.Recently, the city traffic police gave permission to the BBMP for the white-topping of the RV Road.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has advised commuters to use alternative routes to avoid traffic snarls. “Work will be taken up on one side of the metro corridor. So, traffic will be restricted to one stretch at a time,” a senior BBMP official said.“Initially, the work will start from the South End Circle side towards the Lalbagh West Gate,” the official added. Interestingly, the BBMP’s advice to use alternative roads has only added to the problems of the commuters in South Bengaluru. Already one side of the KR Road has been blocked at different stretches, thanks to white-topping.Besides, the roads passing through VV Puram have also been blocked for traffic in some of the junctions forcing the motorists to circumnavigate to reach the JC road towards Central Bengaluru. About white-toppingThe BBMP project to lay concrete roads — white-topping as it is known in official parlance — is turning into a never-ending nightmare for the citizens. In the past two years, the civic body has initiated white-topping in many stretches across the city. Work started on white-topping 94.5 km of roads in some of the city’s central areas at a cost of Rs 986 crore last year. Five months after the deadline, just 15% of the work is done. Undeterred, the BBMP is extending the project to 41 additional roads in the heart of the city and to the proposed Peripheral Ring Road.The BBMP initially planned to complete the work in nine months time. But the project was delayed due to the failure in getting permission from the traffic police. Later, BBMP started work on half the carriageway in a few stretches to make way for vehicles.

Water scarcity threatens pedestrian safety in Bellandur	in southeastern Bengaluru’s Bellandur ward, pedestrian safety for instance.In Bellandur, well-laid footpaths and pedestrian safety remain a far-fetched dream for citizens as the authorities turn a blind eye. To top it, the civic bodies are now allowing private entities to dig up existing footpaths.On Friday, a borewell was dug right in the middle of a footpath along the Kasavanahalli Road in Bellandur by a private individual. When questioned about the same, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) officials said the concerned individual has official permission for the same.The residents now are concerned about pedestrian safety. “Pedestrian safety has never been a matter of concern to our civic bodies. There have never been proper footpaths in Kasavanahalli. I hope the borewell will be demolished and wound up, to avoid danger especially to children,” said Latha M, a resident.“But, we have to address the water problem here. The entire ward is facing water scarcity. Everybody needs water here. The BWSSB and BBMP should take the problem seriously,” she added.One of the apartments in Kasavanahalli had no water for almost 20 hours on Friday. “SJR Verity Apartment residents were inconvenienced and distressed. It affected so many office-goers and children who had to attend schools. Depending on the borewell is a joke now. All borewells have been depleted here. We are relying on water tankers.There are many such apartments in Bellandur that are suffering from water shortage,” said an activist from Bellandur who didn’t wish to be quoted. According to the residents, as many as 200 apartments in Bellandur are devoid of BWSSB’s Cauvery water supply, while a few are already in the process of receiving the supply. They say they have recently written a letter to the BWSSB chairman and are awaiting action.	water shortage,BBMP,Bellandur,Bengaluru,BWSSB,	 Mar 11 2019
No adequate lighting in city bus shelters	of illumination in bus shelters, the Mayor on Thursday directed the traffic engineering cell to fix the lights in all the BBMP bus shelters.Arthur Solomon, a civic activist had complained to the Mayor and senior BBMP officials about insufficient lighting at bus shelters, raising a major safety concern. “Apart from the shelters along the Krumbigal Road, bus shelters in the city seldom have proper lighting. The passengers, especially women and senior citizens, feel unsafe,” said Arthur Solomon.The city has 8,000 bus stops and only 2,000 stops have shelters. The shelters lack amenities for passengers using public transport. “After I have complained to the BBMP, the Mayor has directed the traffic engineering cell to take immediate action and has alerted the concerned contractors to fix the lights. If they fail, they will be blacklisted,” he added.Meanwhile, DH accessed the mayor’s order. “It is found that most bus shelters in BBMP limits lack lighting facilities. These shelters should be lit up immediately. Stern action will be taken against the concerned officials who fail to fix the problem,” it said.Residents complain most bus shelters have turned into advertisement panels, with no space even to display the name of the bus stop. The lighting used is exclusively for advertisements.“The bus shelter in Malleswaram 18th Cross is so scary due to the lack of lighting facilities. The street light there is not working too,” said Rashmi Muralidhar, a Malleswaram resident.The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has 2,212 designated bus shelters. The BBMP had called tenders for 1,200 shelters, to be built under the public-private partnership (PPP) model.	Bengaluru,BBMP,bus shelters,	 Mar 11 2019
KSPCB directs BBMP to check road dust	city, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) has directed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to come up with measures to reduce the amount of dust kicked up on the roads.The directions have come after Chief Secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar took note of the issue at the committee meeting held last week.“We have asked the BBMP to rein in the road dust problem. Though construction is going on everywhere and it is the hot and dry season, special care needs to be taken,” Manoj Kumar, KSPCB member secretary told DH.“Construction works like flyovers and white-topping are going on everywhere. As per procedures, roads around areas where construction is going on should be sprinkled with water at least twice a day to settle the road dust. Besides, the BBMP should also ensure roads are swept, but none of this is happening,” pointed out another KSPCB official.According to the KSPCB, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Jayanagar, a residential area, on March 5 was 136 and particulate matter (PM 2.5) was 143 parts per milligram (ug/m3). At Nimhans, AQI was 106 and PM 2.5 was 122. As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the standard PM 2.5 value is 60 ug/m3 for 24 hours. CPCB analysis up to 4 pm on March 6, showed AQI as 116.Bengalureans are demanding measures to minimise road dust. Commuters can be seen moving around wearing masks. Paediatricians and pulmonologists say patients with respiratory problems and infections have increased.“Bengaluru is known as the Asthma capital and the number of cases are increasing. It is difficult to put a specific number on the number of patients. But apart from children, the cases of women coming with breathing problems are on the rise. We are advising them to wear masks and change their travel timings,” said Vanitha G, a pulmonologist.However, Sarfaraz Khan, BBMP joint commissioner, solid waste management, said the civic body is procuring 34 mechanical sweepers. At present, there are eight.Another BBMP engineer blamed the summer for the water crises.“Tankers are costly. So, we are unable to water the roads under repair. People will have to cooperate,” he said.	Karnataka State Pollution Control Board,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,	 Mar 10 2019
Mahadevapura residents hit by water shortage	seems to be in the thick of it, though summer has just set in. Being the biggest tech corridor in the city has made the area highly vulnerable. And there is no better illustration of this than a startling statistic: Over 70% of the population in the zone depend on water tankers, according a citizen survey conducted on Facebook. The survey shows that 25% of people do not have borewells and only 5% have adequate Cauvery water supply.Residents said that supply of Cauvery water had been reduced over the past few days, leading to high dependence on water tankers. But the situation is good news for water tanker mafia, which is cashing in on the situation by charging exorbitant rates.“We are facing a severe crisis in Bellandur. Only 55% of our water needs are being met here. This week, Cauvery water has reduced drastically and now tankers are blackmailing us and not supplying water. Besides, they are demanding more money,” a resident said.Another resident alleged that the BWSSB and the water tankers were hand in glove. “There are Cauvery lines everywhere, but no water has been released by the municipality yet. Looks like the BWSSB and water tanker suppliers are hand in glove. We are not even getting 10 litres per day per family despite paying a lot to get Cauvery connection,” said Prasad Kumar, a Whitefield resident.The residents said borewells along the kaluve on the north side were dry as Varthur lake water was flowing out more in the south weir. The borewell valve handlers addressed this issue with the ward committee members during the last committee meeting.Local MLA Aravind Limbavali had demanded more funds to solve drinking water problems in his constituency at the Belagavi Session, as the Rs 25 lakhs announced by the government was not sufficient.Officials said they were doing their best to solve the problem. “We have been digging borewells wherever necessary with funds released by the government. Despite this, sometimes there is a shortage of water during summers. It is also the responsibility of the BWSSB to complete the Cauvery water supply connections in all 110 villages in the city,” said R L Parameshwaraiah Chief Engineer, Mahadevapura.	water shortage,Mahadevapura,	 Mar 09 2019
Steel flyover to be back in concrete avatar	steel flyover project from Chalukya Circle (Basaveshwara Circle) to Hebbal, is set to resurrect it by going in for a concrete flyover instead of steel. A detailed project report (DPR) for the flyover is likely to be ready within two weeks.In conversation with DH on Thursday, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara said he has told officials “to do away with steel” which had led to a controversy.“The reason for choosing steel was that the foundation of the pillars need not go as deep as concrete and hence, would take less time to build. I have instructed officials to prepare a DPR for a concrete bridge and it will be ready in two weeks,” he said.The project had faced public opposition when it was proposed by the previous Congress government due to its impact on the environment. According to documents, 812 trees have to make way for the bridge and only 56 of them can be transplanted.Asked about concerns of the activists, Parameshwara said the government will compensate for the loss of greenery by planting more trees in the coming days.“Trees have to be cut along the stretch and there is no alternative. Tenders will be called to plant one lakh saplings ahead of June. We are also mulling to incentivise tree planting by the general public,” he said.The proposal is likely to rankle civil society which launched a movement against the project.When asked about the claims that the flyover was not sustainable, the deputy chief minister promised that the DPR will be placed before the public.“We will place the project report in public domain. The suggestions by the public will be considered before a decision is made,” he said.According to the previous DPR, the work comprised the main flyover of 6.68 km as well as eight ramps of about 4.5 km.It also proposed three underpasses at Chalukya junction, Millers Road and Cunningham Road.

Srirampuram underpass to open after 10-yr delay	project on time. There are several instances of projects delayed for 4-5 years.Here is a project which was delayed nearly for 10 years after it was announced.The railway underpass at Srirampuram that connects Malleswaram to Rajajinagar, Gayatrinagar and Srirampuram is all set to be thrown open for public use.The project was planned in order to ease traffic along the existing old and narrow underpass. However, it was delayed for almost 10 years due to land litigations.“The land acquisition process was delayed as there were three stake holders — Mantri Developers, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and South Western Railways (SWR). In 2007, when the project was launched, the new underpass was planned on the northern side, but to accommodate the metro pillar, SWR changed the location of the underpass to the south. But, the site belonged to the Mantri group. After several consultations, the group agreed to lay a road for public through their land, and the project kick-started,” a BBMP engineer on the spot told DH.The delay in the project has irked a lot of residents in the surrounding areas, as the narrow underpass would lead to traffic jams, especially during peak hours.“The movement of heavy transport vehicles are causing endless traffic jams in the locality. Now, with the new underpass, we can expect smooth traffic,” Chengappa, a resident said.The residents, meanwhile, are expecting a change in the traffic pattern in the locality after the inauguration of the new underpass. Traffic police said the underpass is in the wrong place and they are planning to redesign the flow of traffic in the area.“If the underpass was on the northern side, then we wouldn’t worry. But, now we have to redesign the movement of vehicles towards the Malleswaram railway station. We cannot make the commuters go through the new underpass, take a U-turn, and then come back from the old underpass to take a left. We will come up with a new arrangement before the inauguration of the new underpass,” a senior traffic police officer said.	BBMP,Srirampuram,Underpass,	 Mar 08 2019
Residents fume over Cauvery water delay	Bommanahalli zone are angry over the BWSSB’s delay in finishing the pipeline work.Under the Cauvery water supply scheme 5, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) started laying pipelines at various layouts in Bommanahalli zone in South-East Bengaluru two years ago.Now, the unending work has exasperated the residents as the dugout roads to lay pipelines are causing disruption of traffic and kicking up dust. BWSSB officials, meanwhile, cited lack of funds and irregular labourers for the delay.Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara laid the foundation for the supply of Cauvery water from BWSSB at Uttarahalli, Vasanthpur, Yalchenhenahalli, Thippasandra, Gudigere and Begur wards in Bommanahalli on Wednesday.He was rather taken aback by the fact that though the construction of ground level storage tank in Uttarahalli side has been completed, the inauguration is yet to happen.“If the drinking water project is shut down, the masses will be affected. Interest on the loan will also increase as there is no implementation for two years. All of this burdens the government,” said Parameshwara.“Water supply will be provided to 17 villages in Uttarahalli,” he added. 15,000 connections were given for this purpose, he said.However, the residents of Bommanahalli expressed their dissatisfaction about the project.“Cauvery water supply is needed at all wards of Bommanahalli. There is a huge dependence on water tankers at the moment. All the borewells have been depleted. Most of the houses and apartments are not eligible for the supply of water under the project. The government should do something for them as well,” said K Prakash, president, Beautiful Begur Federation.“Around 10,000 people are dependent on Cauvery water in Bommanahalli. What we receive from water tankers is impure. My children are falling sick after drinking the water from the tankers, despite having water filters at home. We need Cauvery water soon,” said Satyendra Khare, a resident of Begur.	BWSSB,Cauvery water,Bommanhalli,	 Mar 08 2019
Govt imposing elevated corridor on city: Experts	city’s environment while the procedure adopted by the government to push for the project violates the Constitution, experts said on Wednesday.Former Environment Secretary Yellappa Reddy, chairman of the Bangalore Environment Trust, said the government will do irreparable damage to the city’s crumbling ecosystem if it were to cut down 3,600 trees for the proposed project.“The government is imposing a project on people without asking them whether they really need it. Finally, it is we the public who have to deal with the ill effects of such unsustainable works,” he said.Reddy said the government’s job was to conduct wider public consultations and commission studies to find out a solution for traffic congestion.National Law School of India University professor M K Ramesh said the tender process violates the principles laid down in the 73rd and 74th amendment of the Constitution.“It is a blunder that the BBMP, the local governing body, has been kept out of the loop. It is not just a procedural error. A statutory body can’t bypass a constitutional body,” he said.According to Ramesh, contrary to the assumption of the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL), officials can’t skip public consultation before going ahead with a project. He cited a 2010 judgment of the Karnataka High Court to state the process was mandatory.“Also, officials have gone on record stating they have consulted departments and hence there was no need to consult the public. But departments are not stakeholders. How can the government equate itself to stakeholders?” he asked.Meanwhile, on a sarcastic note, Bengaluru Rural parliamentarian D K Suresh on Wednesday said the government must build an elevated road on Magadi Road instead, which will ensure both Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy and PWD minister H D Revanna reach Hassan faster.Speaking at the foundation laying ceremony to rejuvenate the Thippagondanahalli Reservoir in Ramanagara district, D K Suresh said: “An elevated corridor must be built between Summanahalli Junction and NICE junction (Magadi Road). The CM and the PWD minister perhaps could allocate funds for the project as well. If the corridor is built, Hassan can be reached faster.”	road,elevated corridor,Bengaluru,	 Mar 07 2019
New train to Delhi on Kolar route launched	have another train, which will run via Chikballapur, Kolar and Katpadi and also connect Renigunta, thereby benefiting Tirumala devotees.Union Minister D V Sadananda Gowda and Bengaluru Central MP P C Mohan flagged off the inaugural run of the Yeshwantpur-Hazrat Nizamuddin Weekly Express at Yeshwantpur on Tuesday.Railway officials said the date for regular services will be announced shortly. The timetable will also be finalised in the coming days, they said.Former railway minister K H Muniyappa said the train will benefit thousands of people travelling from Chikballapur, Kolar and Bangarpet. The train has a stop in Renigunta, which will help those travelling to Tirupati.‘Suburban rail soon’Mohan said the Centre had taken a proactive approach to clear all the hurdles for the suburban rail. “Even the 19 conditions put forth by the state government, which had become a problem, are now cleared. We hope the foundation stone will be laid within a week,” he said.	train,Bengaluru,Delhi,	 Mar 06 2019
Civic body to upgrade digital infrastructure	Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will set up an Information Storage Retrieval and Management System. The system will store documents and backup data on various services of the civic body.BBMP has earmarked Rs 7.50 crore in the budget for upgrading digital infrastructure. According to the proposal prepared by the civic body the digitisation of various departments that provide services, a good digital communication network, and a robust computing platform are important and rather urgent requirements for an organisation like the BBMP, where dependency on IT applications is growing.“The information from various applications is stored at the data centre which is hosted at the BBMP IPP Centre, Malleswaram. BBMP also has a mini data centre which is located at the head office in NR Square. The storage and backup of this information are critical for BBMP,” states the proposal.“For a developing Bengaluru, with growth comes a higher level of responsibility towards providing services to the citizens. BBMP must have an advanced data centre to store information,” said an official from the IT department. “Soon, the system will be upgraded in the IPP Centre and the BBMP head office. The E-Office software will be utilised for the faster processing of files in all the offices of the BBMP,” he added.The officials hope the upgradation of the data centre and E-Office will be implemented in another three to five months.

Smart Variable Messaging Systems to help city traffic	is set to install Smart Variable Messaging Systems (SVMS) in arterial, sub-arterial and other major roads in the city.The SVMS act as an information centre for vehicle users providing live traffic updates, journey time, distances, traffic density, alternative routes, weather and emergency directions. The SVMS project will be taken up with the help of state government funds, at a cost of Rs 50 crore.“SVMS will provide real-time traffic updates and will suggest alternative routes with minimum traffic density. The state government will fund the project through BBMP,” said an at the Traffic Engineering Cell.In 2010, Bengaluru traffic police installed 20 LED signboards under the B-Track project which have not been upgraded since. In September 2019, for the first time, the state government installed SVMS in Mysuru making it the first city in Karnataka to have such a system. “The BBMP has called for a Detailed Project Report. Signboards will be set up along high-density corridors,” the official added.VVIP movement, traffic norms, traffic diversions, temperature, highway patrols, nearest fire station and ambulance availability will be displayed. “SVMS will measure 2.5×5 feet, with a colourful display unlike LED signages. The message will be visible to motorists at least from a distance of 100 meters. Kannada and English will be the languages,” said the official.	BBMP,Bengaluru,traffic,SVMS,	 Mar 05 2019
Bengaluru's toxic air a lab for dust-eating machines	be the main causes of pollution in the city, fine dust particles, measuring less than 2.5 micrometres, have now turned out to be the latest threat.With this, the city has become a laboratory for outdoor air filter companies to test their ‘Dust Eater’ machines.Fitted with sensors and filters capable of detecting fine dust particles, these filter cubes suck the ambient air and retain fine dust and other harmful substances while releasing fresh air back into the environment.Capable of functioning in all weather conditions, these dust eaters are designed to function according to the intensity of the fine dust particles, thus saving on energy as well, according to Harsha Prakash Gowda, an expert on fine dust eater project.Experts have been studying the efficacy of the machines.While Germany-based Mann Hummel had first installed a stationary filter cube dust eater in association with the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in Cubbon Park and in Peenya Industrial Area, another firm in association with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) set up one at the busy Hudson Circle.The companies have also been approached by international schools and IT firms to set up these fine dust eaters on their premises.“Fine dust is a problem in urban areas due to slow moving heavy traffic. According to KSPCB data, a whopping 62% of fine dust is due to road traffic and emission. Of the 62%, exhaust emission contributes only 30% and the rest comes from brake dust, tyre and asphalt abrasion. These are perhaps split-second action but trigger a lot of PM 2.5. Largely invisible, it gets easily absorbed into lungs and blood,” says Pradeep Randhawa, vice president and MD of Mann Hummell.The firm’s dust eater machine is on trial at an international school in Delhi where air flow in the children’s play area is being purified.Officials have also been interacting with the state government and transport department for installation of these machines in outdoor ambiance. The dust eater has also been designed to absorb nitrogen dioxide NO2. Dr Rahul S Patil, consultant cardiologist and head of the Project Premature Coronary Artery Disease (PCAD) at Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research said, “Air pollution is one of the causes for heart attacks at the young age. Prolonged exposure to vehicle emission impacts the heart according to our study. In those who are exposed to pollution like traffic police and drivers, the blood is hyper viscous and unable to flow freely through arteries. Such patients reveal abnormal fluctuation in their blood pressure and heart rate causing heart attacks.”	Air Pollution,dust,	 Mar 05 2019
KRDCL to rework corridor alignment	the alignment to the 96-kilometre elevated corridor that would link it with other modes of transport at 53 intersections.The agency has embarked on the project after a recent cabinet meeting that gave Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy a free hand to decide on the elevated corridors.“The government has asked us to take a relook at the project,” a KRDCL source said. “It was pointed out that around Rs 50,000 crore is lost in traffic junctions, where each citizen waits for at least two minutes at each signal. There are at least 120 traffic signals in the city.”Sources added that a meeting was held following the cabinet decision where the decision to revisit the project was taken. “We’re taking a relook since the prime objection of people is that elevated corridors focus on road commuters. It was also decided to include the Chalukya Circle-Hebbal loop into the project,” the source added.Giving the example of Electronics City, they said: “The metro is extending till there and there’s also a major bus stand. The alignment should be made in such a way that the commuter using the elevated corridor can park his vehicle and immediately take any public mode of transport.”Similar is the case with Mysuru Road, where again commuters should be able to hop on to the public transport of their choice once they get off the elevated corridor. In places like the Vidhana Soudha metro station, they should be able to get signal-free connectivity once they deboard the train.The corridor should have up and down ramps that seamlessly link places like the Mysuru Road bus terminal with Nice Corridor and the metro station, something important for long-distance travel.

KRDCL invites elevated corridor tender sans Cabinet nod	was pushed to the backburner, with the cabinet asking the chief minister to decide, it has seen a dramatic revival.The Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) is taking the project forward by inviting tenders. It has released advertisements to this effect. KRDCL has broken the project into three packages on two, three, four and six lanes. The packages will be the north-south corridor from Baptist Hospital to JC Nagar, JC Nagar to Shantinagar and Shantinagar to Central Silk Board.While the project’s total length is 96 km, tenders have been called for 22.22 km for three packages of 6.15 km, 8.75 km and 7.22 km. The tender bid is for a three-year project and 10-year maintenance period.KRDCL officials said they were acting on government’s orders. Tenders have been called after the project report had been tabled before the government, they said.Citizens and experts have raised serious objections. “How could they call for tenders when the project is not cleared by the cabinet and placed before people for opinions?” asked Ashish Verma, associate professor, Centre for Infrastructure Sustainable Transportation and Urban Planning (Cistup), IISc.“All projects should go through due procedures, including public consultation. The government is repeating the mistake it did on the steel flyover,” Verma added.He said the KRDCL did not obtain environmental clearances for the project. Given its size, it should have been thoroughly studied. But the government is projecting the elevated corridor as the ultimate solution. It has failed to do a study or released a report on its feasibility in terms of the suburban railway, metro, BRTS (Bus Rapid Transit System) or other options.Ironically, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara met citizens, experts and lawmakers over the past few weeks. He also assured that a public meeting would be held, while now it appears that the government is going ahead with the tender process.	elevated corridor,KRDCL,	 Mar 04 2019
Metro in Anjanapura by Aug 2020	Kanakapura Road. The BMRCL on Sunday announced that track-laying work was in progress for the extended metro line from Yelachenahalli to Anjanapura under Phase 2.The BMRCL said track-laying work will be completed by October and several works on the Reach 4 extension will be taken up in the coming days to ensure the opening of the stretch to the public by August 2020. “The BMRCL is planning to open this line by August 2020,” the release said.The 6.05-km extension from Yelachenahalli to Anjanapura Township will help thousands of travellers, who now get down at Yelahchenahalli and wait for buses at crowded junctions to travel further. The line will have five stations, including Vajrahalli, Talaghattapura and Anjanapura.The BMRCL is also making arrangements to begin track-laying work on Mysore Road-Kengeri section (Reach 2 extension) by the end of March. The work is likely to be completed by December, the release said.In a release, the corporation said that the track-laying contract has been awarded to Texmaco Rail and Engineering Limited, a New Delhi-based company, at an approximate value of Rs 530 crore. The work includes laying of tracks in Phase 2 main lines and all depots.	Namma Metro,BMRCL,Anjanapura,	 Mar 04 2019
Work on longest Metro tunnel to begin soon	and Nagavara — to be the longest such structure in the state — seems to have got a head start with officials signing contract for two packages.The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) announced on its website that work on two of the four packages has been assigned to L&T Limited. The Vellara-Shivajinagar package will be built at a cost of Rs 1,329.14 crore while the cost of Shivajinagar-Tannery Road has been finalised at Rs 1,299 crore.The previous tenders for the 13.7-km tunnel section, split into four packages, were cancelled after the lowest bidders quoted about 70% more than the estimated project cost. The re-tendering seems to have saved a lot of money. The agreement finalised on Thursday shows the cost of the two packages has gone up slightly, by about 17.5%.Asked about the time required for starting the work on the ground, BMRCL Chief Public Relations Officer B L Yashavanth Chavan said it depends on several factors. “The contractor will have a 42-month deadline from the day of issuing the letter of interest. He has to make preliminary studies and mobilise the resources for the execution of the project,” he said.The tenders for two more packages — Dairy Circle to Langford Town and Tannery Road to Nagawara — have March 21 as deadline for bid submission. Officials said it may take about five months for awarding the contract.The underground section poses a big challenge as unpredictable rock formation and other geological conditions make the work difficult. Three of the four packages have two tunnel boring machines (TBM) each while the fourth one will have three machines to finish the task faster.The cancellation of tender and re-tendering process has delayed the work by a year. Officials last year planned to reduce the tunnel section to 5 km after seeing the exorbitant cost but later returned to the original plan. With the latest bids, the corporation has ensured that it won’t get a raw deal.	Namma Metro,	 Mar 02 2019
Upgraded Church Street completes one year	Street in the city’s Central Business District completed one year on Friday. Although the road with a cobble-stone pathway has turned a model for Brigade Road and Commercial Street to emulate, grey areas of concern remain.Walkers, particularly the youth, are flocking to the street in big numbers. After over an year of losses due to construction, business is picking up for the scores of eateries, book shops and other outlets along the road. But parking issues remain. So does vehicular traffic and garbage management.Pedestrians have complained about overspeeding cars and motorcyclists, haphazard parking and garbage bins left uncleared for days. The one-way rule is violated with contempt with no traffic police in sight, particularly so after 11 pm.The parking regulations, proposed when the upgraded road was inaugurated a year ago, are still nowhere in place. It was proposed that the street be closed for entry of vehicles from 12 noon to 12 midnight.The road’s designer and architect, Naresh Narasimhan, had suggested that no vehicles be allowed after 12 noon from the Brigade Road side. This, he says, could be achieved by positioning manned boom barriers near the Starbucks outlet.A few critics had questioned the project’s construction quality. But Narasimhan counters this: “Only four out of 1,45,000 cobblestones laid on the road had come out.” The vehicular speed limit is 10 kmph. There is no policing or enforcement. For pedestrians though, the positives have been clear: absence of obstructions, quick draining of stormwater, well-planned underground utilities that negate the need for any road-digging and good lighting. Yet, many have articulated the need for better bins and regular maintenance.The road’s architects had suggested that the tertiary treated water from the Cubbon Park sewage treatment plant could be used to wash the road regularly. Parking could also be streamlined with about 300 paid car parking slots coming up at a new commercial complex at the street’s junction with Museum Road.Under a Rs 9-crore upgrade, Church Street had a total makeover. The British era underground utility were completely replaced, the lanes were made uniform with granite cobblestones and the footpath rendered pedestrian-friendly. The state government recently made a budgetary announcement that this model will be replicated on Brigade Road and Commercial Street.	Church Street,	 Mar 02 2019
Institute offers solution to metro tunneling problems	during the tunnel construction for Namma Metro Phase 1. Now, this can be avoided with the help of advanced seismic tomography developed by the National Institute of Rock Mechanics (NIRM).Engineers from Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) urged the NIRM to come up with a technology that can help in understanding underground rock formations in the built-up surface areas in Phase 2.NIRM director H S Venkatesh said it was the only institute in India with a specialised geophysics engineering group that can provide the precise information on the location and size of the boulder. “Several years of experience has helped the team of experts to come up with sophisticated technology that can help avoid delay in projects,” he said.BMRCL officials said while huge boulders pose a challenge in tunnelling work, tunnel boring machines (TBM) can cut through them in a time-consuming process. Smaller boulders of 3-5 metre in diameter start rotating along with the blades of the TBM, instead of getting cut.Metro engineers said the damage to the cutter-head of the Godavari TBM in April 2014 stalled the work for over a year. Importing a new cutter-head from Italy and delay in the work led to more than Rs 10 crore extra.Dr P C Jha, scientist and the head of Department of Geophysics at NIRM, said they have the technology to map the boulders. He said BMRCL contractors use borehole logs to assess the underground surface, which will not be able to map the boulder.“The seismic refraction study, done from the surface, can tell the type of the rock and its location within 20-metre reach. However, if a free surface is not available along the alignment, NIRM’s seismic tomography survey (which is done from boreholes) can provide a full projection of the size of the boulder besides the usual information. Though it is 4-5 times costlier than the surface survey, it is negligible considering the cost of delay,” he said.	Namma Metro,BMRCL,	 Feb 21 2019

'Bengaluru has rules but no will to manage waste'	"but comes last in enforcing them, experts said on Sunday. Bengaluru is the only city in India to have rules and laws on garbage disposal but there is no one to speak on how they should be implemented. As a result, only half of the garbage generated in the city is scientifically managed, said Shekar Prabhakar, Managing Director, Hasiru Dala Innovations Private Limited, a waste management services enterprise. He was speaking at a day-long conference on 'Exploring the challenges cities face on the road to resilience-discussing the future of Bangalore'. ""Will Bengaluru's burgeoning air and water problem force the city into a Bangkok-like shutdown,"" Divya Narayan of Jhatkaa.org asked. She said waste generators, collectors and the government must work together, but that was not happening. ""Bengaluru is the worst in garbage management,"" panellists said. Malini Parmar, the co-founder of Stonesoup, said the High Court of Karnataka's decision to lay down solid waste management rules for Bengaluru had prompted 15 other Indian cities to voluntarily start the two-bin one-bag method. While other Indian cities have been following the prescribed colour code for bins, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) keeps changing the colour code of bins (red, blue and green), she said. Citing the example of Church Street, Jaideep Singh, co-founder, Ambee, a start-up, said having two bins for wet and dry waste was of no help as their content was the same. ""This is because there is no clear demarcation of which is for what,"" he added. Singh linked improper waste management to the rising cases of garbage burning. ""This has increased the number of toxins in the air, leading to more air pollution and more health problems. In cities like Bangkok, there is a shutdown when AQI (air quality index) increases the 100 threshold but that's not the case in any Indian city,"" he noted."	Garbage,	 Feb 18 2019

Sirsi Circle flyover one side opens today: BBMP	open for traffic from Friday evening.After a delay of three days, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials have said the road from Town Hall towards Mysuru Road will be open for commuters from Friday evening onwards.The BBMP had undertaken the asphalting work of the flyover and the work on this route had begun during the end of December last year. The traffic from Town Hall was diverted to alternate routes via KR Market.“The asphalting work from Town Hall towards Mysuru Road is completed and we will open the road for traffic from Friday evening,” said K T Nagaraj, chief engineer, road infrastructure, projects, BBMP.He also said that the traffic from the other side of the flyover, from Mysuru Road towards Town Hall, will be shut as they would take up the repair work on that side.“The entire project is expected to be completed in a month’s time,” he said.This time, the civic body is using a new method of asphalting called 'asphalto seal pad' for the road, which not only increases durability, but also consumes less time. A similar method was adopted for asphalting Richmond Circle flyover.	Sirsi Circle flyover,BBMP,	 Feb 08 2019
Now, a 'dust eater' in Cubbon Park	in ambient air and releases purified air.The device comprises three big blocks with air filters, called Filter Cubes, and have been installed by Mann+Hummel, a German multinational filtration expert, in coordination with the Horticulture Department. The device is located near the entrance to the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association.The Filter Cubes were installed in November on a pilot basis and has generated curiosity among officials from the pollution control boards of Karnataka and other states.Recently, West Bengal Pollution Control Board Chairman Dr Kalyan Rudra visited the site to take notes. They have sought for analysis reports and verification of data.While explaining about the device, Harsha Prakash Gowda, expert Fine Dust Eater, Mann+Hummel, said the device is attached to sensors. Once the level of particulate matter in the atmosphere crosses 100 micrograms per metre cube (prescribed highest value by CPCB), the machines will switch on and start to suck in ambient air, purify the PM 10 and 2.5 by 60-70% and release it back into the atmosphere.Each block has pre-filters, main filters and fans to suck the air and release it. The complete instrument is equipped to clean 10,000-metre cube of air per hour. It runs on electricity and the sensors are active between 8 am and 8 pm. They are synced with the opening and closing of the Cubbon Park gates.Varadharajan B, Lead Engineer, Simulation, Mann+Hummel, said the instrument also analyses data which has been sent for analysis to ascertain the efficiency and air quality. The report will be released only after it is verified.Varadharajan said average air pollution even at Cubbon Park is of PM 10 and 2.5 is around 130- 150 micrograms per metre cube on any given day.A N Yellappa Reddy, expert committee member, Horticulture Department, said that it was a common notion that air quality is good in Cubbon Park. But the fact is that it is least studied and it has a high level of particulate matter trapped in it. This is the reason behind the department agreeing for a detailed study.Manoj Kumar, KSPCB member secretary, said, the instrument is good, but test results have to be checked.

600 more toilets soon in the city	Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has decided to build more than 600 public toilets across the city before Gandhi Jayanthi.The Centre has granted Rs 5 crore under the Swachh Bharat Mission programme to construct community toilets, E-toilets and public toilets in all eight zones. According to the guideline set by mission, there should be a community toilet in every 500 metres.A BBMP officer said: “The BBMP has identified the places to build the toilets. We have received around Rs 5 crore from the Centre and the BBMP will sanction remaining funds.”“The work will begin soon after the tender process is completed. We have set October 2 as the deadline to complete the work,” he added.Till date, the civic body has constructed only 479 toilets across the city. According to the norms laid by the Swachh Bharat Mission, the civic body has to build at least two toilets for the population of 100 male and 100 female and one toilet in seven-kilometre radius.In 2018, Swachh Survekshan ranking, Bengaluru had got 216 ranking which had not only slid further down the Swachh Bharat Survekshan rankings but also fared poorly compared to most other Metros in the country.Another BBMP official said, “As we have to improve our rating in the Swachh Bharat Survekshan rankings, we are building toilets to end open urination in the city.”	Bengaluru,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,public toilets,	 Feb 04 2019

Suburban rail project put on backburner	the expectations of the suburban rail project have proved to be nothing more than a set of empty promises as the Union government has put the project on the backburner.The interim Budget presented by Piyush Goyal has allocated Rs 10 crore for the Rs 17,000 crore project during the financial year 2019-20, which eliminates the possibility of any work happening for the next year.In December 2018, Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy had promised to lay the foundation stone for the project after meeting Piyush Goyal in Delhi. “The railway minister promised to take the matter to Niti Ayog for its approval. The minister also assured us of allocating some money for the project in the Union Budget,” he had said on December 27.Sources in the railways, however, noted that the state government’s conditions for approving the draft feasibility report for the project has put off the momentum gained over the last few months.“There was an expectation among the senior officials that the project would take off with a good allocation in the Union Budget. However, the state government’s conditions in the face of railways’ expectation of an unconditional approval, complicated the situation,” sources in the railways said.Activists said it was unfortunate that two years after the state and Union governments signed a memorandum of understanding to build suburban rail network, they have been only finding more reasons to delay the project.Citizens for Bengaluru’s Srinivas Alavilli said the paltry allocation shows the continued apathy of the governments towards a much-needed project. “The gap between Rs 10 crore and the project cost of Rs 17,000 crore is a direct reflection of the difference between the government’s response and people’s expectation,” he said.Urban Transport Sanjeev Dyamannavar said suburban project missed a big momentum and the allied works needed more funds. “Funds have been allocated for doubling Byappanahalli-Hosur and Yashwantpur-Channasandra lines. However, more funds were needed for quadrupling Cantonment-Whitefield section. It is disappointing that automatic signalling and level crossing elimination in Bengaluru division has not been given priority,” he said.	suburban rail project,Bengaluru,	 Feb 02 2019
‘Before investing find cause of deterioration of lakes’	a fault in decision making by policymakers in investing crores of money on the rejuvenation of lakes without finding out the exact reason for their deterioration.Releasing the book ‘India’s Water Futures’ in Bengaluru on Friday, the experts discussed the skewed decisions of policymakers about rejuvenating the waterbodies. The book portrays the emergent ideas and pathways leading to solving the problems of water in the country.A panel discussion was led by Himanshu Upadhyaya, faculty at Azim Premji University, Sharachchandra Lele, noted writer and others, including the editors and the writers of the book.Referring to the Bellandur Lake, Lele said the government needs to think in various dimensions before investing money on the lake’s rejuvenation. “One lake is rejuvenated by desilting it, beautifying it, and reducing the contamination by bypassing the sewage. And if every lake is rejuvenated this way, where will the residue of the desilt go? And where will the bypassed sewage go? “ he asked.The experts also said if there is some depletion in water in a particular river at a particular place, the climate change is blamed but that’s not what it is.“The groundwater contributes to the flow of water in rivers. There is a scientific interlinking between the flow of water in the river and the groundwater. The water in rivers generally deplete due to excessive groundwater pumping and planting more water-dependent trees like eucalyptus. There are many more factors like this,” added another expert.

NGT orders closure of Graphite India	closure order on Graphite India. With this, the 20-year-old legal battle of Whitefield residents, against the polluting Graphite India Limited along the Whitefield Road, has borne fruit.In the hearing on Thursday before the principal bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) comprising Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, Chairperson, Justice S P Wangdi, Judicial member, Justice K Ramakrishnan, Judicial member, Nagin Nanda, Expert member, the 2012 closure order by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) was restored.The NGT has further issued directions to constitute a joint committee comprising representatives of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the KSPCB and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to carry out stack monitoring and ambient air monitoring of the factory, and the surrounding area by installing monitoring stations in 10 different locations. The NGT has also ordered to carry out a study on source apportionment of the pollution sources.The entire study is to be conducted within two months, with the KSPCB as the nodal agency. The report on the same should be submitted to the NGT thereafter.The NGT order comes after the apex Court had fixed a penalty of Rs 50 lakh on Graphite India on October 30 2018, as per the ‘polluters pay’ principle.“Residents around the Graphite India factory are super elated to hear that the NGT has quashed the Karnataka State Appellate Authority order of 2012, which allowed Graphite India to continue operation of the factory. The NGT has restored KSPCB's closure order of 2012. KSPCB should now move forward to implement the order,” said Zibi Jamal of Whitefield Rising.“Whitefield Rising taking up the cause in the middle of 2018 gave us much needed support. The case in the Supreme Court and recognition of Graphite India as a polluter under the 'polluters pay' principle gave much strength to the cause,” said Nivedita Gouda, a Whitefield resident.“It all started with a bunch of mothers who were worried about their children and elders inhaling the polluted air back in 2009. Our persistent complaints to the KSPCB and banding together with other residents who raised similar complaints led to the KSPCB finally issuing the closure order in 2012. Our hopes took a dent when the Appellate Authority overturned the closure order, granted Graphite India the stay and allowed them to operate. But we collected evidence, along with research papers on the effects of graphite pollution and built our case before the NGT and appealed to the court to uphold the closure,” added Gouda.

BBMP to set up a shelter home for transgenders	"Palike (BBMP) is planning to construct a shelter for the homeless transgenders in the city. According to the BBMP's estimate, there are about 15,000-20,000 transgenders spread across Bengaluru. Many of them are in fact homeless.""A shelter home will be built near the BBMP office near Upparpet police station in Gandhi Nagar. The facility would accommodate close to 100 transgenders,” said B N Jagadeesh, deputy commissioner, (welfare), BBMP. The transgenders will also be given coaching for Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Karnataka Administrative Service (KAS) entrance examinations.“We keep seeing transgenders at traffic signals. At the moment there are no shelter homes for transgenders. They do not stay put in footpaths or bus shelters. Even rental homes are denied to them. So, it is important to provide shelters,” the deputy commissioner said.The BBMP is not only providing the shelter but will empower the transgenders with access to vocational training as well.“The roof of the proposed shelter house will be utilised to provide training to the transgenders so that they can learn new skills. We will be providing tailoring, candle making, computer, driving and gardening courses,” added Jagadeesh.Randeep D, additional commissioner (admin), BBMP, said the civic body will be associating with non-governmental organisations to identify the homeless transgenders in Bengaluru. Several organisations including Solidarity Foundation and activists such as Akkai Padmashali will be part of the identification process.Meanwhile, the BBMP is already setting up shelter homes for the urban homeless men and women.With the help of Dream India Network and Impact India Consortium, the BBMP officials are working on a project to provide shelters to the urban homeless in the city. In the survey conducted across West, South and East zones, the BBMP identified 3,991 homeless people."	shelter home,BBMP,Transgenders,	 Jan 31 2019
BBMP to set up social media grievance redressal centre	through Twitter, Facebook, e-mails and SMS to resolve civic grievances. To address people’s problems posted on social media, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has floated a tender to set up a Unified Grievance Management System (UGMS). The UGMS will be housed at the BBMP’s head office, in annexure building 2.“We have called a tender to set up a call centre too along with the UGMS. The grievances posted on social media will be directed to the concerned departments for resolution,” BBMP special commissioner Randeep told DH.In December 2018, the BBMP had called a tender to set up a 24/7 centralised command and control centre to monitor Solid Waste Management (SWM). “UGMS will be set up along with the proposed 24/7 centralised command and control centre to monitor SWM,” said Randeep.In 2017, the BMRDA (Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority) had set up a social media centre. Now though, it is being used by the city development minister, the BDA and also the BBMP.The BMRDA centre was inaugurated by former Bengaluru Development and Town Planning minister K J George.

BBMP is renovating Harishchandra ghat	ghat burial ground in the city’s Rajajinagar area reportedly at a cost of Rs 50 lakh.The civic body is upgrading the two electric furnaces at the ground.BBMP’s electrical executive engineer for burial grounds V Anand said: “The existing furnaces are horizontal and now, we are making them vertical.”Anand said doing maintenance work with the horizontal furnace takes a lot of time since the bricks have to be removed periodically. “The vertical furnace reduces the maintenance time,” Anand said. “The furnaces are now completely dismantled. With the horizontal ones, it takes up to three days to cool and heat up. With the vertical furnace, we can finish the same work within a few hours since we don’t have to replace the coil. Until now, we had to wait for the coil to cool down. Now, (the renovation) saves the time,” he added. The BBMP is also replacing the chimney with an electric one. A minimum of six bodies are cremated in the furnace, which could go up to ten sometimes necessitating the renovation of the chimney, the executive engineer said. The civic body has made arrangements at Chamarajpet and Somanahalli burial grounds to accommodate bodies for cremations until the Harishchandra ghat is ready.The cost of renovating the burial ground is said to be Rs 50 lakh. “We have been given February 18th as the deadline and we are trying to finish the renovation work before that,” said Anand.“Usually it takes an hour to cremate each body, which costs Rs 250,” added Anand.

Kidwai reeling under acute staff shortage	cancer treatment in the state, is facing acute staff crunch. According to its director, the hospital is functioning with just about 30% of manpower.Dr C Ramachandra, the director of the institute, said for 650 beds, there are about 820 staff, including doctors, nurses, technicians etc. There is a shortage of 839 staff members.Most of the Group D workers, about 360 of them, including security guards and cleaning staff, are outsourced.The hospital proposes to build a 450-bed capacity building for which addition of 885 staff needs to be recruited in a year.“We already have people who have agreed to construct the 450- bed hospital. I am waiting for the government to sanction the posts required. The chief minister has been hopeful. But we just want files to move at the earliest,” the director added.He said the institute was creating six new departments for which additional staff was required.Once the additional 450 beds are ready, the Kidwai would have about 1,100 beds, becoming the largest cancer care hospital in the country.The scene a year agoIronically, experienced contract staff from the hospital were removed a year ago. About 200 contract staff members, working for over 10 years, had protested seeking regularisation of their service.According to one of the protesting members, who now works in a private hospital, said most of those who protested could not continue working at the hospital. “The hospital asked us to write exams and go through the procedure for regular appointment, to which we agreed. We had sought 5% of weightage as we were all experienced staff members.“But the hospital and even the high court declined our request. Only three of the 200 contract workers could clear the regular appointment procedure,” added the former staff.Most of these experienced staff missed out on the regular post with some five to 10 marks.DH News Service	Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology,Bengaluru,	 Jan 31 2019
Mini Lalbagh taking shape in East Bengaluru	on Hoskote road and the unsightly land around it will be transformed into a botanical garden christened as East Lal Bagh.Spread across 152 acres, the coconut farm, which is a unit of the State Horticulture Department, is home to about 3,500 coconut trees of different varieties. The department is all set to lay out a botanical garden, giving lung space to the citizens of Bengaluru’s biggest IT corridor. The project was proposed four years ago but the groundwork had not begun for want of funds. The project is estimated to cost around Rs 1.5 crore, according to officials.Similarly, the work on setting up similar mini botanical gardens on the lines of Lalbagh at Chikkaballapur, Tumakuru, Mysuru and Uttara Kannada (Sirsi) are in full swing, according to horticultural officials.As the farm already encloses a thicket of coconut trees, the department is planning to sow suitable saplings in the habitat. The existing coconut palms are utilised for mixed cropping, multi-tier cropping, border cropping and intercropping. “We will plant shade plants that include flowering plants like orchids, spices and condiments, beverage crops, fodder grasses, timber trees, palms and buffalo grass. Coconut palms are the base plantation in various cropping systems. It has the potential to produce more high-value crops,” said N Jagadish, Joint Director (Parks and Plantations), Horticulture.Work like installing irrigation network has been done and a 2 km walking stretch is being constructed now.The garden might also include an amphitheatre and butterfly garden including signage everywhere helping visitors. The safety measures are being taken against coconuts falling.“The coconut trees adjacent to pathways are to be installed with basket made of cast iron. For the remaining trees, regular checking should be done,” said Jagadish.The coconut farm has been maintained by the department for abut 35 years now. The farm is facing a severe water crisis.“We need at least 20 litres of water a day. To cater to future water needs, we will use treated water from industries around. We have completed rejuvenating the existing borewells and drilling of four new borewells have been completed. We have also installed pumpsets and sprinkler irrigation systems,” added Jagadish.This mini Lal Bagh is an expansion of the existing botanical garden in the city which serves as a refreshment to the citizens in East Bengaluru.“We cannot expect the same footfall as in the main Lal Bagh.

Activists recount trees along proposed flyover route	were seen counting the trees on Ballari Road.Vijay Nishanth and Shiva - urban conservationists and activists - on Tuesday counted the trees once again on the stretch from Basava Circle to Hebbal flyover where a steel flyover has been proposed.“Around 140 trees have been marked to be axed for the steel flyover. So we are counting the trees once again. The final report will be placed in the public domain,” said Nishanth, who is also the founder of Project Vruksha.In 2016, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had counted 812 trees along the stretch. The BDA had then said while 56 trees will be translocated, 756 will be axed. This number has now been dropped to 140. But citizens are not convinced and so they are counting them for themselves.“In just one hour from Cauvery theatre to Palace Grounds, we have counted 92 on one side. The trees belong to various species, including Gulmohar, Rain Tree, Mahogany, Indian Coral tree, Copper Pod, Country Fig and Jamoon,” Nishanth added.The duo is noting the tree number, species, girth and age. The exercise will be completed in two days.Interestingly, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has not yet received any information on the number of trees to be axed.The Forest Cell of the BBMP maintained that no application had been made to the Tree Officer and to the Tree Authority.According to the Tree Act and the Karnataka High Court, it is mandatory for the BDA or anyone to seek permission from the Tree Officer before cutting down any tree.But since the number of trees to be axed are more than 50, then as per court orders, a public hearing will have to be conducted by the Tree Authority, a BBMP forest cell official said.	steel flyover,Bengaluru,	 Jan 30 2019
City's traffic woes: DH submits charter of demands	in their approach to city’s traffic woes, which are multiplying by the day. It’s in view of this looming crisis that DH organised an event to find solutions.The discussion, ‘A City Stuck in Jams: Is There a Way Out?’, saw senior officials from the government as well as experts and activists from the transport sector emphasising the need for integrating different modes of transport.Based on the ideas emerging from the event, DH prepared a charter and presented it to Transport Department Principal Secretary B Basavaraju and Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) P Harishekaran.The demands included ideas from IISc professor of Transport Engineering Ashish Verma and activist Vinay Sreenivasa, who stressed the need for supporting public transport instead of funding huge infrastructure projects like elevated corridors and steel bridge.Basavaraju, who received the charter, said work was on to establish the Bengaluru Metropolitan Land Transport Authority (BMLTA) and the long-pending Road Safety Authority. “The charter of demands has some good suggestions. We are already working on implementing some of these and will consider others too,” he said.At present, issues related to city commute are handled by the Transport, Urban Development and Home Department. The BMLTA will act as an overarching body where plans and decisions are made with the concurrence of all departments at once.Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) P Harishekaran said he would distribute the copies of the citizens’ charter among DCPs (Traffic) and discuss how best the points can be implemented. Officials said the formation of a road safety authority was in the last stages. The Assembly has already passed the bill, only rules have to be framed, they said.	Bengaluru,traffic,	 Jan 29 2019

Mahadevapura flyovers: BBMP weeds out invasive plants 	the flyovers in Mahadevapura and KR Puram. Residents, meanwhile, suspect bird droppings could be one of the reasons for excessive plant growth on the concrete structures.The drive is on as there has been an intensive growth of plants of late, especially small shrubs, in expansion joints and weep holes of the flyovers in the area.The citizen activists of Mahadevapura had identified the issue and had complained to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) four years ago.At the time, the Palike officials were confused as to which department should take up the responsibility for invasive plants as the residents complained the civic body was passing the buck.Finally, on BBMP chief engineer G Parameshwariah's instructions the work commenced a few days ago in Mahadevapura and KR Puram.“The work was supposed to be done seven years ago, but it stretched until now. We have checked the plant overgrowth in Marathahalli and Narayanapura flyovers so far. There are about 14 flyovers in Mahadevapura alone. We will complete the work in a couple of weeks,” said Parameshwariah.“We have applied anti-growth agents in affected areas so that the plants do not sprout again. The plants exert pressure on the concrete structures and destabilise them over time. Hence it is always good to remove them,” the chief engineer said.According to him, removing the plants from flyovers requires a lot of effort. “We need long ladders that reach every nook and cranny of the concrete structures. Also, doing the work during day time causes traffic jam. Hence, the work is done meticulously during night,” he added.“This was a long pending issue and many residents have attempted to address this for over four years. Various BBMP departments washed their hands off saying it is not their responsibility. Now that it is done, we need a BBMP department to be accountable and periodic maintenance should be in place,” said Clement Jayakumar, a resident of Doddanekundi.“These plants, especially the peepal or the ficus, can cause structural damage. This is such a necessary exercise and should be done periodically. Many a time in the past, some of us counted 20-odd such saplings on KR Puram cable bridge and Marathahalli rail bridge and informed the authorities,” added another resident.

Parameshwara announces Rs 50,000 cr project for city	the IT capital of India, is on the cards.With an aim to upgrade the amenities on the lines of other international cities, the state government is up for a huge development plan for the city, said G Parameshwara, Deputy Chief Minister and Bangalore Development Minister.Speaking at the inauguration of Shankar Mutt ward development programme on Monday, Parameshwara said: “I have ordered the officials to prepare a roadmap to develop the city in the next five years,” he said.“The pace at which the city is growing is tremendous, and we will spend Rs 50,000 crore for the project,” Parameshwara said.He added that property tax collection was important to increase the revenue targets.“A total of Rs 2,500 crore property tax collection is pending. I have ordered the officials to take strict action against the defaulters. The names of defaulters will be published if they fail to pay the tax,” he added.However, the details of the project are not yet known.The minister also said the steel flyover project would be taken up, despite the general opposition.“There is some opposition for the steel flyover project. This is an elevated road. But it is called steel bridge as a certain amount of steel will be used in the construction process. We will not let go this project just because some people oppose it. We will be transparent during the process. If anyone comes in the way, we may resort to legal action against them.”Reacting to this, Srinivas Alavilli, co-founder of Citizens for Bengaluru said: “It is very unbecoming of the minister. We are asking for public consultation. We want the government to consider the development of Bengaluru in a holistic way. We cannot build things in isolation. Let there be more push for the sub-urban rail and metro network.”Parameshwara also said the state cabinet has approved replacing the sodium vapour lamps with LED lights as this would help the BBMP save Rs 18 crore per month. “Our goal is to transform Bengaluru into a global city,” said Parameshwara.A badminton court, tennis roof and a BBMP office were constructed under the Shankar Mutt ward development programme.Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun, BBMP ruling party leader M Shivaraju and BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad were present on the occasion.

Kidwai hospital to digitise patient records	Memorial Institute of Oncology, as the hospital is all set to go digital with the patients’ records.At the moment, patients have to carry hospital records, reports and scanned images in person for the scheduled appointment with the doctor.If all goes well, in the next six weeks, the complete patients’ records will be available online for the oncologists treating cancer patients at the state’s premier institute of oncology.“We have tied up with Infosys Foundation to digitise patients’ records. We hope it will happen soon. Every patient will get a UID number (unique identity number) and all the records of the patients will be tagged to the UID. Each and every treatment record including scan reports, blood reports etc will be saved under the UID. This way the doctors can have a complete history of the patient at their fingertips,” said Dr C Ramachadra, director of the institute.Explaining how the digital records maintenance will help, the director said most patients misplace the physical records or do not come for a proper follow-up. “It is also very difficult when the history of the patient is not available easily, patients have to carry it around and some even misplace them. Many patients coming from far-off locations do not come for the follow-up on time and this affects the treatment of patients with cancer,” added Dr Ramachandra. More than anything, the hospital will now be able to collect data of cancer patients, analyse it and use it for teaching and for further research. According to the director, there might be initial hiccups going digital with the records, but digitisation is what the hospital will be using henceforth.The hospital treats over 1,000 patients in OPD and has 650 beds that are always occupied and many patients in waiting. About 400 patients undergo radiation and 40 patients take chemotherapy.	Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology,	 Jan 28 2019

Fresh bids for tunnel line of Namma Metro's Phase 2	line of Phase 2, the BMRCL has invited fresh bids for the last two packages of the 13.7-km tunnel between Dairy Circle and Nagavara.The BMRCL had previously thought of reducing the tunnel to about 6 km after four companies quoted 69% more than the estimated cost, escalating the price of Rs 5,000 crore civil work by nearly Rs 3,500 crore.After cancelling the tender, the BMRCL has been inviting tenders for the underground section in packages. The time-consuming process has delayed the Gottigere-Nagavara (Reach 6) line by nearly two years. Bids were invited for two packages in the middle of the tunnel section last year.The tenders invited on Monday cover the tunnel section’s tail ends — Tannery Road to Nagavara (4.59 km) in the north and Dairy Circle to Langford Town (3.65 km) in the south. The civil work for the 8 km stretch is estimated to cost Rs 2,811.75 crore. The bids will be opened in March but the financial evaluation may take some months. Tenders for the midsection — Shivajinagar to Tannery Road (2.88 km) and Vellara Junction to Shivajinagar (2.75 km) — were invited in June 2018. The work is yet to be awarded as the last date for the bidding was postponed several times. The civil work should be completed by 2022.	Phase 2,BMRCL,underground line,	 Jan 24 2019

Renovated Sarakki Lake to lure birds in their thousands	"place where birds flocked in thousands. Now, officials involved in its renovation want to restore its past glory. The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) is planning to build an island at the lake’s centre to allow birds to perch and settle amidst the cooler surroundings of the waterbody. Bommanahalli MLA M Sathish Reddy inspected the ongoing renovation at the lake on Wednesday. Speaking to DH, Bommanahalli corporator C R Rajmohan Raju said: ""We are planning to construct a central island and make it attractive for birds.

Plans are also on to build a cycling track, a ramp for walkers, a gymnasium for senior citizens and a children's play area around the lake, he added. ""The entire lake was filled with sewage water and silt. BWSSB workers are still trying to fix the sanitary pipes releasing sewage water into the lake. About six feet of muck has been removed from the lake so far,” he further said. Reddy urged the state government to grant an additional Rs 10 crore for the lake’s renovation. ""We've been granted Rs 9 crore for the work. We've written to the officials to grant more sums,” Raju said. He said two spots will be created at designated places to immerse idols during the Ganesha festival."	BDA,Sarakki Lake,Lakes in Bengaluru,	 Jan 23 2019
Buffer zone ruling will hit 35K flats: BBMP	affidavit before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, giving the details about the number of buildings to be affected if the NGT’s order on buffer zone is followed retrospectively.The BBMP claimed that 35,054 flats would be affected as they come under the increased buffer zone limits. Though the BBMP has given the sanction plan and commencement certificates, it has not issued the occupancy certificates. According to the affidavit, over 31,500 buildings come under the buffer zone of stormwater drains or rajakaluves. Approximately, there are 19.40 lakh buildings in the BBMP area.Speaking to DH, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said the hearing is continuing on Wednesday also, and the decision will help them know the status of these buildings, whether they will be retained or demolished.As per the ongoing case in the Supreme Court, whether the NGT can change the buffer zone of lakes and stormwater drains or not, close to 66,554 buildings in the city are in question. During 2016, NGT ruled saying that to protect the environment, the buffer zone of lakes have to be increased from the existing 30 meters to 75 meters from the lakes. It even shut down a few industries in the city, which was falling under the increased buffer zone.	Buffer zone,BBMP,NGT,	 Jan 23 2019
Construction and demolitiondebris piling up in B'luru	the civic agencies and the pollution control board officials are worried about. Construction and demolition waste (C&D) piling up across the city is posing a major challenge.With the C&D waste accumulating by the day and nothing going to the landfills, officials from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) are now encouraging people to use the C&D waste for their own works.According to C&D waste rules of 2016, property owners should dispose of the C&D waste. As that is not happening it is piling up everywhere, Manoj Kumar, KSPCB member secretary said. He added that the rules also define that at least 60% of the C&D waste should be recycled. But this has had little impact as well.Though the KSPCB and the BBMP identified a three-acre space to receive 1,000 tonnes of C&D waste per day in Chikkajalla in 2017, nothing has been dumped there so far. Bengaluru is the second city in India after Delhi to have a designated area for C&D waste.“It is a good resource; people can utilise it. C&D waste consists of bricks, mud, rocks and much more. Some people have been taking small quantities to level their land in low lying areas. More people shall do the same,” Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner, health and solid waste management, BBMP told DH.He said the BBMP is also looking for empanelled agencies - like quarry owners - to collect the C&D waste and utilise it.Haphazard management of C&D waste has also agitated the chief secretary, T M Vijay Bhaskar, who is also reviewing the matter and how it should be handled.KSPCB officials are in fact worried that the rule mandating penalising of those stocking C&D waste on roadsides has not been implemented till date by the BBMP. Due to this heaps of C&D waste continue to remain unattended across vacant sites and roadsides.	BBMP,Construction Debris,	 Jan 22 2019
BMTC hopes to get NGT nod to add 1,200 buses	burden with increased maintenance costs, the BMTC has proposed to acquire 1,200 new buses over the next one year, hoping that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) will not show a red signal in the final hearing next month.In 2019, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has to scrap about 400 buses that have run 8.50 lakh bus kilometres or buses as old as 11 years, BMTC Managing Director N V Prasad said.The exercise will effectively bring down the strength of the fleet from the existing 6,500, which the activists have long held as inadequate considering the rising demand for better public transport.“We plan to induct 1,200 buses and hope to obtain the NGT’s nod for the same during the final hearing scheduled on February 27,” he said.With losses crossing Rs 650 crore by the end of the previous financial year, the corporation is seeking nearly Rs 300 crore government aid to manage its operations. While the previous Siddaramaiah-led govt had cleared a proposal to lease 1,500 buses, officials have sought the government’s help in purchasing the 1,200 buses as per the directions of the Transport Minister, D C Thammanna.Sources in the legal wing of the Transport Department said the NGT had not blocked the acquisition of new diesel buses. “The NGT has not said that we can’t buy diesel buses but has directed us not to buy without bringing it to their notice in view of increasing pollution in the city. However, considering that the BMTC plays a significant role in reducing emissions despite using BS IV vehicles, we are confident that the NGT will see our positive role,” a source said.Exemption soughtThe government recently gave Rs 100 crore grant to the corporation, which helped in clearing the gratuity pay dues. However, the staggering financial loss has only climbed further high, thanks to the increase in the diesel prices.The BMTC has also sought exemption from the Motor Vehicle Tax, which costs the corporation about Rs 120 crore annually.

Two damaged roads stuck in PWD-contractor tussle	unattended for more than a year now as a result of a tussle between the Public Works Department (PWD) and a contractor.The road connecting Sarjapur and Ittangur in south-east Bengaluru is frequented by more than 1000 commuters every day. Now it is filled with nothing but mud and dust.The PWD had started the repair work two years ago, but a rift between the PWD officials and a contractor has left the road unattended, say the residents. According to them, the commuters are facing the brunt.“The contractor of this road has been blacklisted by the PWD but is attending to the Sarjapur-Chandapura road work. He hasn’t started the work; it’s been 8 months,” says Deepanjali, a member of Voice of Sarjapur. However, Yethiraj, assistant executive engineer, PWD, dismisses the allegation that there was a fight between PWD officials and the contractor. “The contractor just slowed down the work but has never stopped the work. There was a small misunderstanding that has been sorted out now. The contractor has started the road work and will complete it in a month,” he said.A road connecting Dommasandra and Attibele via Sarjapur village in southeastern Bengaluru was widened a few months ago, but it has already worn out.“The road is full of potholes. There are no street lights, nor there is space on either side of the road for footpaths. No trees or stormwater drain either. There is no speed limit as it is a national highway and has no traffic signs. High-speed trucks are creating a dangerous situation for pedestrians and small vehicles,” says another member of Voice of Sarjapur.The Karnataka Road Development Corporation (KRDCL) is responsible for the repair and maintenance of the national highway, says Yethiraj. “PWD is yet to hand over the road development project to KRDCL. It is in the process. The PWD can’t invest in the repair work of the road as KRDCL is anyway going to do it. But we have made temporary repairs to ease traffic,” he adds.

Fog disrupts 29 flights at KIA	International Airport on Monday morning.The arrival of 23 flights was delayed. The visibility was so low that no flight could land between 7.49 am and 8.26 am, according to Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) officials.When the visibility dropped below 2,500 metres, a standby was declared at 4.22 am. This was withdrawn only at 9.12 am. Hundreds of passengers were affected by the disruptions.	Kempegowda International Airport,fog,	 Jan 22 2019
'NGT order will see 95% of Bengaluru buildings razed'	respect to buffer zones around the lakes and stormwater drains were implemented, it would result in the demolition of 95% of buildings in Bengaluru, the Karnataka government has told the Supreme Court.Besides, the state would be forced to pay a compensation of Rs three lakh crore to the people. The green tribunal has enlarged the buffer zone specified in 2015 revised master plan, which was statutory in character, and declared it as a no-construction zone, it said.In a written note, Karnataka’s Advocate General Udaya Holla had told a three-judge bench presided over by Justice A K Sikri that the NGT ordered for maintaining a buffer zone of 25 m as a no-development zone, and demolition of all constructions falling in the area.“Tertiary stormwater is in front of every house/building. None of the plots/sites in Bengaluru, barring a few, measure more than 50x80 ft. Therefore, if the impugned order is to be given effect to, nearly 95% of all buildings will have to be demolished,” he said.According to the BBMP’s map of primary and secondary stormwater drains of Bengaluru, their total strength aggregated to 856.74 km. Consequently, the buffer zone required to be kept in BBMP aggregated to 21,400 acres. In addition, the increased buffer zone in respect to lakes aggregated to 11,000 acres within the BBMP area. Thus, the total buffer zone with no development required to be kept totalled to 32,400 acres, which is equivalent to 131 sq km. If the tertiary storm water drain is also taken into account, virtually, the whole of Bengaluru will have to be kept vacant as a buffer zone with no construction.Sections 60 and 69 of the Karnataka Town Planning Act mandated the state to pay the market value to the owners of the land if it was required to be kept as an open area.“Taking into consideration, the conservative market value of Rs 10 crore an acre, the total increased buffer zone would require the state to pay a compensation of over Rs 3,00,000 crore,” the top law officer of the state said.The state government also claimed there are existing 31,500 buildings in the increased buffer zone of lakes and 19.40 lakh in increased buffer zones of stormwater drains.The top court is to resume hearing on Tuesday on a batch of appeals filed by the Karnataka government and others, against the NGT’s May 4, 2016 order for maintaining a buffer zone and a green belt of 75 metres in case of lakes, 50 metres for primary, 35 metres for secondary and 25 metres for tertiary rajakaluves.

Ward-wise tenders for wet waste disposal	"level, the BBMP has called ward-wise tenders to dispose of waste. This will include the collection and segregation of wet waste, sanitary waste and street sweeping waste, and secondary transportation of segregated wet and street sweeping waste in all 198 wards.BBMP special commissioner Randeep D told DH: “There is a standing high court order that the tender on SWM has to be called in a decentralised manner and in packages for each ward. The contractor who will successfully bid for the tender will collect the wet waste. Earlier, both dry and wet waste used to be collected by the same contractor.” The tender cost is pegged at Rs 435 crore. The last date to submit the bids is February 20. ""This move will encourage people to segregate waste at source,"" he added."	Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,Garbage collection,	 Jan 21 2019
BBMP for reusables over single-use disposables	guidelines shortly on the use of disposable materials at events organised in the city. It has been found that paper and plastic materials make up 16% of Bengaluru’s waste. In order to reduce the amount of waste generated at events, the BBMP is now pushing for reusable materials as against single-use disposables.This was enforced as a pilot at the Organics and Millets 2019 International Trade Fair last weekend, which was held at the Palace Grounds on Bellary Road.“We want to issue a general directive to event organisers from both private and government entities to avoid using single-use disposables in programmes. For instance, if organisers use paper plates or disposables that are made of areca palm stalks, it may be allowed as per the law. However, these are single-use and are thrown away thereafter. We have to use steel plates instead in such cases. We are trying to focus on our shift from single-use disposables to re-usable materials,” said Randeep D, additional commissioner (admin), BBMP. “The emphasis is going to be on reusable materials,” he added. Meanwhile, citizens feel that this is a great move by the civic body.“Be it programmes at our homes or large scale events, food is an integral part. Disposables need a lot of space and use various materials for packaging. Using a steel plate instead of a paper plate can make a lot of difference,” Praneeth K Sargur from Sarakki told DH. “This should not remain on paper but should be implemented on the ground. The government banned single-use plastic water bottles, but the city is not rid of them yet,” said Sneha Ram from Banashankari III Stage.

Sarakki signal: Residents protest for better footpaths	Kanakapura Road staged a protest on Saturday against the lack of basic civic amenities like proper pavements and footpaths. They came together under the umbrella of KARAMOC (Kanakapura Road Apartments Movement of Change). The residents formed a human chain, demanding that issues such as lack of footpaths, two-wheeler parking along footpaths and lack of pedestrian crossing in their area be addressed. They want the civic authorities to install bollards along the footpaths as it has been indiscriminately used by two-wheelers, making it difficult for pedestrians to walk. They want the broken footpaths to be repaired as well as encroachments to be cleared. The protesters also highlighted the lack of pedestrian crossing at the Sarakki signal, with just 10 seconds to cross the road. They also demanded that pelican signals be installed.Dumping of garbage on the roads and open spaces was another issue they wanted to highlight. Marshals must be deployed to check this menace and defaulters should be penalised, they said. TV actor Sudha Belawadi, who is a resident of the area, participated in the protest.

Fruits, veggie vending machines at 10 places in B'luru	will soon be installed at 10 public places in the city.All you will have to do is insert a Rs 10 or Rs 20 note and get what you want. The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), which has developed the machines at a cost of Rs 2.5 lakh each, has sent a proposal to the state government to instal them at bus stands, railway stations, the BBMP head office, Lalbagh and main markets. The machines will vend 36 different fruits, vegetables, flowers and seeds round the clock. IIHR representatives will be present to help customers. The first of such machines has already been set up on the IIHR campus in Hesaraghatta, according to the institute’s director, M R Dinesh. The machines are generating interest. The Puducherry agriculture minister visited the institute recently and placed an order for setting them up in the union territory, Dinesh added. The IIHR has also come up with a fruit and vegetable vending mobile van that can store 400 kg of fruits and vegetable and keep them fresh for at least two days. Each van will be fitted with humidifying boxes to keep fruits and vegetables cool and fresh. The rooftop will have a solar panel to power the boxes. Each van costs Rs 12 lakh, including the steel material and the solar panel. Mushroom rasam in mid-day mealsThe IIHR has suggested including mushroom powder-mixed rasam in mid-day meals. “...Mushrooms are rich in protein as well as vitamins B and D that help in children’s growth,” said institute director, M R Dinesh.

BDA's revised master plan 2031 set to get govt approval	across the city, the government has decided to give a green signal to the long-pending revised master plan 2031.It has also decided to drop the proposal to place the plan again before the people for a final opinion and wants to clear at the earliest what the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had presented.The government arrived at the decision as it did not receive any inputs from the specially constituted inspection committee to oversee the master plan.Sources in the government told DH that the government has decided to clear the master plan tabled by the BDA, which has been finalised after incorporating all 14,000 suggestions made by the people.The BDA had received over 14,000 suggestions when the draft was placed before people for opinions and following this, it had revised the draft master plan. This proposal is pending before the government for the past year.To oversee the minute details of the master plan, in 2017, the government had formed a three-member committee, which comprised retired and serving IAS officers. Apart from giving suggestions on improving the plan, the job of the committee was to oversee the progress the BDA had made in addressing issues of people.The committee, however, met only once on January 31, 2018. The sources in the government said since the committee made no headways, it was decided not to delay the master plan.A senior BDA official said: “The government has decided to take the master plan ahead from where it was left, without any delay. The decision was taken at the last meeting held with the chief minister and the deputy chief minister. This is a good move as the pressure on the BDA from lobbyists to make changes is only increasing .”According to the master plan process, the BDA had given 60 days time to people to respond to the master plan, the official explained. The second public hearing was only an addition.	BDA,Master Plan,	 Jan 19 2019
BBMP dumping yard puts Kundalahalli Lake in danger	few years, is threatening Kundalahalli lake with activists stating that mounds of waste may be slipping into the lake.Residents of Kundalahalli in East Bengaluru said garbage and construction debris at the periphery of the lake have reached dangerous heights. While the waste is sliding to the footpath on Kundalahalli main road, they fear that it may be getting mixed with water on the other side.The residents with the help of civic body had rejuvenated the lake a year ago with the help of corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. They had installed a sewage treatment plant that is currently in operation.Besides, there is a 20-acre landfill near the lake where the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) solid waste management contractors segregate the waste. All this has turned a bugbear to the residents in the vicinity of the lake.Lake activists claimed that the construction debris has been dumped at the buffer zone of the lake, in violation of National Green Tribunal guidelines.“The garbage spilt on the footpaths has led to the growth of wild plants and bushes. The area has become dangerous to walk after dark, as it is a desolate stretch. Several incidences of robbery and molestation attempts on women have occurred in December. As the road is neglected by authorities, eateries have come up causing traffic congestion during the day leaving no space for parking vehicles,” said Gilbert Millicent Nathan from Huawei Technologies India Private Ltd, a resident.He added: “Stench from the garbage is spreading to software companies nearby. Thousands of houseflies from the garbage dump yard are spreading across roadside eateries and office canteens, posing a risk to health.”A BBMP official said the garbage was being segregated at the same vacant land for some years now. “We are not given any other land to segregate garbage. We will get the dangerous bushes chopped down,” said a BBMP official.	Kundalahalli lake,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,garbage dumping,	 Jan 19 2019
BBMP to launch e-vaccine programme	roll out Electronic Vaccine Intelligent Network (eVIN) to monitor the status of stored vaccines in hospitals across the city.The eVIN is an app-based technology that helps in gathering real-time data on stored vaccines, its stocks and flows, and even its storage temperatures across all cold chain points in the city.“All these days, we were monitoring the condition of vaccines manually. This technology will ease things out as we can monitor online,” said Dr Manoranjan Hegde, chief health officer, BBMP.“This also reduces the wastage of vaccines. Once there is a change in the temperature in a place, the sensors will send signals through the app, so that necessary action can be taken immediately,” explained Hegde.“The BBMP will launch this project across 87 primary health centres and 30 maternity homes across the city in the next 10 days,” he said. All our staff have been given adequate training, he added.How this works?With the help of the eVIN application, those who monitor the storage have to update the information about the net utilisation of each vaccine in standardised registers at the end of every immunisation day. Temperature data is recorded and updated every 60 minutes on the server via General Packet Radio Service. The difference in temperature is communicated by sending an alarm through a mail or SMS.The programme was launched by the Centre in 2015. It was rolled out across 12 states in 371 districts, including Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The government is extending the programme across Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttarakhand.	Vaccine,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,	 Jan 19 2019
Minor fire at KIA reinforces preparedness	International Airport (KIA) here late Tuesday night was attributed to a short-circuit. Dubbing it a 'minor' fire, a Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) spokesperson informed that it was put out within five to seven minutes.The fire was reported at 10.30 pm. However, it did not cause any disturbance to the airport operations, according to the spokesperson. The incident also did not warrant a probe. But the episode has reinforced the airport's fire safety preparedness since any bigger breakout could be catastrophic. KIA is India's third busiest airport with an estimated 32 million passengers using it every year. Understanding the risk involved in an airport with huge volumes of the highly inflammable stored in aircraft tankers, BIAL had acquired four Rosenbauer 6x6 fire trucks exported from Austria. Three of these are in active service, while one is a backup vehicle. In case of a fire emergency, these fire trucks are programmed to be at any spot within the airport premises in two minutes. The trucks are powered by an 18,000 cc engine with 703 BHP, reaching speeds of 80 kmph in less than 25 seconds. Each truck weighs 40 tons and ferries 12,500 litres of water, 350 litres of fuel and 1,500 litres of foam. To respond to the threat of a chemical/biomedical disaster at KIA, the Union Home Ministry had recently announced that the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) will set up a Regional Response Centre (RRC) in Yelahanka with an estimated 1,000 personnel. A quick action fire response team is expected to complement any such action by NDRF.	Kempegowda International Airport,Fire Accident,	 Jan 16 2019
Road underbridge near Kadugodi to be ready soon	be complete in a month enabling smooth traffic flow, service roads to be built soon will further add to the comfort.The RUB lies on the stretch that connects Kadugodi and Channasandra junction, which is the main link to Hope Farm, Hoskote, Devangonthi and Chikka Tirupati. The initial works took off three years ago and the construction started just last year.The RUB comes as a relief to commuters as they will not get stranded in the traffic jams at Bengaluru-Jolarpet railway track that intersects the stretch.However, the locals and other commuters wanted the service roads badly as they are forced to take a complete detour through the RUB. Once the service roads are built, they can take routes to their respective layouts without passing through the RUB.The civic body has started the land acquisition process for the service roads and has notified over 49 property owners in the area for the same. Only two buildings that belong to railways on either side of the RUB will be demolished while the rest of the properties are vacant lands, according to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials.Unlike other Palike projects that get stuck in the land acquisition issues, the process for the project is going smoothly as 50% of the landowners have already agreed to receive transferable developmental rights (TDRs).“If the rest of the landowners do not accept the TDRs, then we will look for an alternative compensation method. As of now, we have only recommended (TDRs),” said Ramakrishna Reddy, assistant executive engineer, BBMP.The project costing about Rs 16 crore is shared by the civic body and South Western Railways equally.

Smart city project Phase I to kick off soon	off soon, a year after the formation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to implement the project.Works under Phase I of the project worth Rs 100 crore will begin in five to six months.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the nodal agency to implement the project, is planning to renovate historical markets, 20 major roads, parks, lakes and slums under Phase I.A senior BBMP official said: “The Detailed Project Report (DPR) for Phase I is being prepared. For the project, 50% of the funds are being provided by the central government and the remaining 50% by the state government. It will take around five to six months to take up the project, including the tender process.”“The total cost of the project is around 2,100 crore and around Rs 800 crore worth works will be undertaken through the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model,” he added.According to the proposal, KR Market will be integrated with the Metro terminal to make it more user-friendly. Along with KR Market, Russel Market will also get a face-lift with technology-enabled features such as smart bins, loading and unloading pathways, and designated vending kiosks.“Under the project, about 20 roads will be brought under TenderSURE project. Swathanthra Palya slum will also be developed in the first phase of the project,” the official explained.Bengaluru is among the 30 cities chosen to be deemed as Smart Cities last year and Rs 1,200 crore has been allotted to implement this infrastructure-based project in the city.

Parking without chaos, is there a way out?	on a narrow, one way street? If the city’s Brigade Road is a case in point, here’s one suggestion to better the existing angular parking method that triggers congestion every time a car reverses from a slot: change the orientation.But this, too, has its limitations. So does the third option to park the cars parallel to the vehicular flow.Parallel parking is the best, says Additional Director General of Police, M A Saleem, who is also Commissioner for Traffic and Road Safety. However, on a street as short as the Brigade Road stretch, not more than 55 cars can be accommodated when parked one behind the other.For Sharath Bhat, a freelance advertising writer, the way out is option-2, as illustrated. “You essentially back into your parking slot in the first place. When you’re doing this, you’re not interrupting traffic, but backing towards the kerb,” he explains.The big difference, Bhat points out, is the ease with which you can move out of the parking slot. “All you do is slowly join the flow of traffic. You don’t block the flow. In the first option, if a woman driver needs to exit her parking slot, she will need help from some passerby to (navigate) back out of her slot.”But not everyone is convinced that this is better. “In the second option, reversing into the parking slot will be problematic. When the traffic is heavy and the distance between your car and the one following it is too short, how do you stop and reverse without creating congestion?” counters a commuter.Option-1 illustrates the current state of parking on Brigade Road, a method replicated on many streets across the city. Every time a car pulls out of its angular parking slot, it actually backs into the down flow of the incoming traffic. This considerably slows down the traffic, leading to a pile up, triggering extreme congestion during rush hours.Motorists want to zero in on the best option before the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike implements its ‘Smart Parking’ project, aimed at curbing illegal parking. Under this project, parking spaces are to be equipped with sensors installed along the roads.The sensors will send information on slot availability to display boards placed on streets and to a dedicated mobile app.	parking,Bengaluru,	 Jan 03 2019
Steel flyover will choke even if built today: IISc prof	it was ready by now, according to the original deadline of 2018 for the project. Instead, the government should build a metro line that can serve until 2049, an IISc study shows.Interestingly, IISc professor Ashish Verma uses the traffic volume data from the detailed report (DPR) prepared by the government-appointed agency, to show how the traffic volume to capacity (available road space) would go beyond the saturation level for the present traffic as well.The DPR puts the average vehicle growth rate at 4.75% for the steel flyover, which is much below the 10.6% growth in airline passenger traffic at the Kempegowda International Airport seen in the past nine years.However, the analysis shows that the steel flyover’s volume to capacity would be 1.4 instead of the ideal ratio of 0.7. Hence, the six-lane road cannot serve even today’s traffic, let alone the next five years when the vehicle numbers are likely to cross 1 crore.In stark contrast, a metro line with a narrow viaduct to hold a track on each direction would be able to carry 69,000 people per hour. Even if all of the passengers on the stretch switchover to the metro, the capacity will not go beyond 0.99 till 2057.Besides felling over 800 trees, the vehicles on flyover will only add to air pollution in the city. “For a city which hosted the C40 conference last year, Bengaluru should be aware of the impact of its projects,” Verma noted.He said building a flyover has become a populist measure in the sense that it caters to the people’s aspiration to own a vehicle.“However, at what cost? When the entire world and even India is trying to reduce our dependence on oil, is it not wise to look at sustainable solutions like metro instead of harping on projects that will make the city unlivable for future generations,” he said.The study also warned that the steel flyover would feed into the ‘vicious circle of congestion’, as the new road will lead to more cars with the traffic jams forcing governments to come up with more and more number of flyovers.“It is well known now that 40% to 50% of the carbon emission in the global cities comes from vehicles. Instead of investing in flyovers, the government should adopt sustainable modes like public transport, walking, bicycling,” Verma noted, adding that people will not take to them unless they are attractive.

Metro services from MG Road to Indiranagar resume	as services resumed on Indiranagar-MG Road stretch, restoring the seamless connectivity between stations on the Purple Line.The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) said the services were restored around 9.30 am, right in the middle of the peak hour during which metro records nearly half of its daily ridership on the line.Train operations between Indiranagar and MG Road stations were suspended on Friday to facilitate repair work on a crossbeam supporting a viaduct on Pillar 155 near the Trinity Metro station.The operations on the stretch were scheduled to resume on Monday. However, on Sunday, the corporation promised to run trains by Tuesday afternoon.The public relations office of the corporation said services were restored at 9.35 am, allowing the trains on the 4 km stretch after a gap of three days.“I was travelling from Magadi Road, and there was an announcement that the train would run till Baiyappanahalli. It was a relief considering the problems we had in switching between bus and metro on Friday and Saturday,” said Sumathi K, a commuter.Ajay Seth, managing director, BMRCL, said an agency would be appointed in January to assess the safety of Phase 1 infrastructure. The external audit would likely to be completed in three or four months, and the report would throw light on similar problems in other metro pillars on the 33.48 km elevated stretch of Phase 1.A rare ‘bonhomie’ between metro and BMTCThe three days of disruption in the metro services between Indiranagar and MG Road stations showed how both transport authorities can work in tandem for the convenience of commuters.The BMRCL had hired 80 to 110 buses from Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) for transportation of commuters. The commuters at Baiyappanahalli, who wanted to reach stations beyond Indiranagar station, boarded BMTC buses that carried them free of cost till the Cubbon Park station.Similarly, the metro commuters who wanted to travel beyond MG Road station could get down at the Cubbon Park station and board buses to Baiyappanahalli.A BMTC officer managing traffic at the Cubbon Park metro station called it a rare bonhomie between the two corporations. However, the BMRCL will have to pay lakhs of rupees for hiring the buses.Last year, the BMTC stopped operating most of its metro feeder bus services, two months after introducing the buses to provide first and last mile connectivity.The corporation had written to the BMRCL twice seeking financial support to run feeder buses, where low ridership led to losses.

Some engineers may have it. But it is not found in the register. An audit has to be conducted regarding the properties owned by the BDA. Later an audit about the BBMP properties should be made. This will help us to know the resources we have,” he said.	G Parameshwara,BDA,	 Jan 01 2019
BBMP to build flyover at 'Y' junction near Okalipuram	construction of the eight-lane flyover at Okalipuram, the BBMP has planned to construct a flyover and a grade separator at Old Mysuru Road (Magadi Road)-Vatal Nagaraj Road (Sujatha Talkies Road) junction.The civic body has called for tenders to construct the grade separator after obtaining a detailed project report (DPR) through consultants. According to BBMP officials, the proposed project will cost approximately Rs 34.7 crore.Speaking to DH, an official from the BBMP Road Infrastructure Division said, “There will be traffic congestion after the contsruction of the eight-lane flyover at the Okalipuram Junction is completed. According to the DPR prepared by the consultant, there may be traffic issues near the Shankarlinga Pandian Hotel on Vatal Nagaraj road.

The civic body has called for tenders to construct the grade separator after obtaining a detailed project report (DPR) through consultants. According to BBMP officials, the proposed project will cost approximately Rs 34.7 crore.
Speaking to DH, an official from the BBMP Road Infrastructure Division said, “There will be traffic congestion after the contsruction of the eight-lane flyover at the Okalipuram Junction is completed. According to the DPR prepared by the consultant, there may be traffic issues near the Shankarlinga Pandian Hotel on Vatal Nagaraj road. To ease the movement of traffic at this junction, we are going to construct two-lane flyover and three-lane underpass.”

Experts to monitor metro pillar for 30 days	155 near Trinity Metro Station for 30 days from January 1 to ensure that the structure will remain safe as per the global standards.Prof Chandra Kishen J M from Indian Institute of Science, who inspected the repair work on Sunday evening, declared that the structure remains safe. But they will keep a tab on it for a month to ensure that its integrity remains uncompromised.“We have been involved in the repair work to avert the possibility of a crack in any part of the structure due to the strain put on it during the lifting of the viaduct. This includes the crossbeam, which had developed honeycomb (gaps in concrete). High-pressure grouting (filling of concrete) has been done to reinforce the strength of the damaged part,” he said.He said 27 censors, called Electrical Resistance Strain Gauges, have been installed on the affected structure. “The viaduct has been lifted for grouting work. It takes 24 hours, for the epoxy material (concrete) to harden, the viaduct will be lowered. Each gauge has been installed on a critical part of the structure and will help us track the strength of the structure,” he said.Trial runLed by Kishen, a team of research scholars is working in tandem with officials from the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) to ensure that the pillar returns to the ‘design condition’.“Once the viaduct is lowered. The experts will examine the strength of the repair work once again. After their approval, the rails on the viaduct have to undergo refitment. After the track is ready, we will conduct a trial run on Monday evening,” a BMRCL official said.Asked about the reason for the defect, the IISc professor said honeycombing in concrete structures was a common feature.“It’s a two-metre deep crossbeam, where the concrete has not been compacted properly. It’s a kind of construction defect that should have been rectified in the construction stage itself,” he said.Meanwhile, BMRCL Managing Director Ajay Seth has asked the IISc experts, who are monitoring the design work on Phase 2, to come up with measures to further improve quality control mechanism in Namma Metro.

White-topping delay leaves Kadugodi commuters in a fix	work on the Kadugodi road has become a bugbear to the commuters. Traffic snarls have worsened in the absence of good alternate routes.Regular commuters of the road said the work stopped some weeks ago.The work on the stretch between Hope Farm and Belathur via Kadugodi road started about 10 months ago, but is yet to wrap up.Meanwhile, the BBMP officials said as per the actual deadline, the project should have been completed by November, but, has been delayed due to the contractor’s slow pace of execution. While the work on one lane of the road is complete, the other lane lies in shambles, remains unattended and unusable.“The Underground Drainage Pipelines (UGD) have been lying on the roadside for two weeks now. Movement of vehicles from one lane where white-topping is complete to the other where it is yet to be done, is not smooth. Two wheelers may skid and fall. I have witnessed such instances myself,” said Kusuma Latha, a resident of Kadugodi.The residents also complain about the false promises made by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). “We have been promised street lights, cycle lanes and footpaths as part of this project. But, none of it is initiated,” added Latha.S Muniswamy, the Kadugodi corporator, said the white-topping work from Belathur to Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning has been completed.“The work beyond that stretch needs to be done soon. It has not been stopped, but delayed by the contractor. The UGD pipes have been on the roadside for some days now; they are not disturbing the commuters in anyway. We are pushing the contractor to finish the work soon,” he said.The corporator, however, said the work might take some more months to finish.	Kadugodi Road,white-topping,	 Dec 30 2018
Now, state govt mulls suburban rail Phase 2	foundation stone for the suburban rail project would be laid in a month, officials on Friday mulled over proposing Phase 2 of the project with an extension of the four corridors to towns further away from Bengaluru.Sources said Chief Secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar held a meeting of senior officials where it was decided to push for the extension of the network.“The proposal will not affect the ongoing process but will add to it. The plan is to extend four lines from the present terminal points at Heelalige to Hosur, Kengeri to Ramnagaram, Rajanukuknte to Doddaballapur and Whitefield to Bangarpet, which will add about 130 km to the network,” the source said.The draft feasibility report prepared by the Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) proposes a 160.5 km suburban rail network at a cost of Rs 17,147.20 crore (excluding taxes) and suggests a 5 km line to the airport from Chikkajala. There are four corridors connecting areas in five different directions outside Bengaluru.“The idea of including the underground line to airport, which may cost more than Rs 1,500 crore, was also discussed.The RITES report only makes a suggestion on the line and including it in the corridor has been left to the two parties,” the source said.While the suburban rail corridor connects Nelamangala, officials discussed the possibility of extending the line from Soldevanahalli (part of Nelamangala line) to Tumkur.“The state government will include the Phase 2 proposal in its comment on the draft feasibility report. However, a meeting will be held with officials from the South Western Railway on January 2 where a decision will be taken on the details of Phase 2 network,” a senior official said.Including the Tumakuru and Airport line, the Phase 2 network may cross 170 km in length and together with the 160 km corridor in Phase 1, officials felt that it would be able to better serve the needs of commuters.Waiting for GoK move: RlysThe South Western Railway sent out a release on Friday stating that it was still waiting for the state government’s reply to some of its proposals regarding the suburban rail project.Giving details of Thursday’s meeting between Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, the release said the state government promised to give all necessary clearances at the earliest.“The railway minister stated that the state government should work expeditiously in giving clearance and agree for grant of higher FSI (floor space index), TDR (transferable development rights) etc. to fund railway’s share of the project (sic),” the release said.	suburban rail,Bengaluru,	 Dec 28 2018
BBMP plans compost learning centres in all zones	"up compost learning centres across all zones.This follows after many enthusiasts come forward to learn different kinds of composting methods at the Swachagraha Kalika Kendra, a centre for training composting practices in HSR Layout.The centre situated at the HSR Layout was inaugurated two weeks ago and has earned the tag of becoming the first such centre established by the residents with the Palike's help.Speaking to DH, Randeep D, additional commissioner, (admin), BBMP said: “We want to encourage segregation practice among the residents. So we are going strictly on the tender process and plan to take up these measures.""""Setting up compost learning centres will not only help in creating more awareness they also will educate about the various practices involved here,” the officer added.The Swachagraha Kalika Kendra teaches close to 20 different methods through which composting can be practised at home, including vermicomposting, aerobic anaerobic methods.The civic body is also planning to introduce the incentive methods for those who compost at least 50% of the garbage produced at their premises.“This thought has been there but has not been finalised yet. If the bulk generators reduce their garbage production using composting practices or through some other method, we can plan to offer incentives, maybe in tax collection,” he said.For those who are active on social media, Randeep said the platform has been encouraging to remove the garbage blackspots in the city.“I have been personally receiving messages and videos from the public through Twitter and other social media platforms. This has helped to make the city cleaner. People can send in their videos or photos directly so that I can direct my officials to undertake immediate action,” said Randeep."

BMRCL cancels Outer Ring Road project tender	KR Puram-Silk Board line on the Outer Ring Road, potentially delaying the line further.According to a report by the Times of India, the move came after debt-ridden firm IL&FS came out to be the lowest bidder for the Silk Board-Bellandur, Bellandur-Doddanekundi and Doddanekundi-KR Puram packages.The IL&FS is currently responsible for the construction of the Mysuru Road-Pattanagere stretch of the Kengeri line.The report, quoting a senior BMRCL official, said that the ongoing work on the RV Road-Bommanasandra and Gottigere-Dairy Circle lines has already affected traffic heavily and adding the 17-kilometre ORR line would only worsen the situation. The official also said that the contractor may not be able to begin work as the traffic police is unlikely to give permission for it.The BMRCL is said to have cancelled the tender because other bidders quoted a higher price than the IL&FS.The IL&FS was put under the scanner of the SFIO in October this year and the Centre is looking to sell assets of the debt-ridden firm to provide relief to NBFCs.

Confusion prevails for new NPKL allottees	Kempegowda Layout (NPKL) due to a communication gap between Deputy Chief Minister, G Parameshwara and the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) board.Even as Parameshwara had assured the allottees that they will be given an additional penalty-free extension during randomisation, the message has not reached the BDA officials yet, due to which the allottees are suffering.Surya Kiran an NPKL allottee said: “We allottees have made many visits with requests to the BDA to wave off the late payment fee and over extension on site payment. But nothing has happened. Time for most of the allottees to make full payment is ending as people have started receiving allotment letters. It is crucial for the BDA to look into it.”Sujatha, another allottee, added that bank loans were already a challenge. Late payment fee will only be an additional burden. She said, “The government cannot penalise us for not being financially sound.”BDA officials, meanwhile, expressed helplessness. They say, that so far, no written communication or government order has come. “The government has not issued any orders and the BDA rules cannot be changed without government and board permission. Parameshwara is the BDA board chairman, and also the Bengaluru development minister,” said a BDA official, who did not want to be named.The allottees had also requested the government to reduce the sale-cum-lease period from 10 years to five years. But, this is pending as well.	G Parameshwara,BDA,	 Dec 14 2018
Act on potholes or lose mandate, HC tells BBMP	BBMP will be declared a failure, and its responsibility will be handed over to another agency if it fails to act on making the city pothole-free. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, while hearing a petition on potholes, asked the BBMP to clear all the zones of potholes starting with Mahadevapura. The area is the worst pothole-affected zone, according to the BBMP. The court further stated that it wants Mahadevapura to be free of potholes by December 17, failing which it will pass orders. The court said that six months had passed, but the BBMP still has not made any substantial improvement. “If the BBMP really wanted, it could have transformed Bengaluru,” the court said. The court further added that if the civic body does not make any improvement to the city by Christmas, then it will have to face the consequences. The court also observed that the BBMP has created a nightmare for Bengalureans. The BBMP has created a problem for itself, and the city, the court said. According to the court, BBMP engineers feel that they are not answerable and are wasting the court’s time; this will come at a heavy cost for the BBMP.On being asked whether the pothole sites are being inspected and the measurement books are evaluated and signed, the Mahadevpura zone chief engineer told the court that he has seen the measurement books, but, has not evaluated or signed them. He would only certify the pothole-filling work on the basis of the assurances given by the BBMP engineers at the respective sites.The court expressed surprise when the chief engineer said that they have not been able to attend to the potholes as they are busy repairing leakages on a daily basis.The court then asked the Mahadevpura zone chief engineer to visit the pothole-filling sites, inspect them, evaluate the measurement books alongside the work done, and certify them. Thereafter, he should produce the certified measurement books before the court for the next scheduled hearing.The court adjourned the hearing of the case until December 17.

BBMP fails to asphalt dug up road in Doddakallasandra	access road dug up and left without blacktop, owing to shoddy civic work by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). The area, among the ones newly added to the BBMP administration, had bare minimum of facilities until the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) dug up the road in October 2017 to lay their water pipeline.Only a month before the civic work, the BBMP had asphalted the road in September 2017. After that, the Palike quite inexplicably took up the Under Ground Drainage pipe laying work, which it is not mandated to do.Praveen, one of the residents, is still clueless as to why BBMP took up the work. “First, (laying UGD) is not BBMP’s responsibility. Still, they carried out the work when it was raining heavily this September (2018) and didn’t bother to asphalt the road. Even levelling of the road was done much later,” he said. He said residents in the area, especially the senior citizens and children, found it harder to breathe due to the dust kicked up by the vehicles on the road.“When I tried contacting the local corporator, she said nothing could be done for the next two-and-a-half years since the road was asphalted in 2017. This’s the typical lack of coordination we see among the civic agencies,” Praveen said.Ward corporator Shobha Gowda assured DH that she would get the road blacktopped at the earliest. “We got the UGD done here through MP. We’ll asphalt the road shortly,” she said.The corporator, however, was not aware that the UGD lines to discharge waste water were actually diverted to another storm water drain. She refused to comment on the issue.. He said the civic body is waiting for the BWSSB to begin the UGD work and asphalt the road after it is over.But a BWSSB engineer said it would be a further two or three months before his agency could take up the UGD work in the area.	road work,BBMP,BWSSB,	 Dec 12 2018
Bids invited for improving footpaths near metros	Rs 81.2-crore makeover. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) invited tenders to this effect on Tuesday. BBMP Commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad said in a tweet: “As part of BBMP’s efforts to improve last mile connectivity, we have floated tenders for development of footpaths and providing non-motorised transit in a number of places connecting metro stations. We intend to complete these works within 6 months after finalisation of tenders (sic).” The project, floated last year, aims to ensure people do not have to walk on traffic-filled roads while reaching metro stations. Curiously, the project includes developing footpaths near MG Road and Trinity Circle stations, where pavements are already in a good condition.	Namma Metro,Footpath,	 Dec 12 2018
Old Airport road footpaths need attention	the HAL Old Airport road was brought to light by DH, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has begun the preliminary work to remove the cables that were blocking the pedestrians’ space.The cable wires jutting out on the sidewalks were cleared, but the rest of the work hangs in the air. The footpaths still have gaping holes in places where slabs are missing. Vendors too, have encroached upon sidewalks in some areas.Several rolls of cables that blocked the footpaths near Manipal Hospital have now been removed. “I can still see some cables in some stretches of the footpath. The BBMP has not completed the work,” said Nirmala Subramanian, one of the senior citizens residing near Manipal hospital.Some residents expressed their despair over the condition of the sidewalks in the area, as they have been unattended for many years now. “I do not know how many days the BBMP needs to carry out the repair work. Nobody cares about the problems faced by the pedestrians,” said Akshay, a resident. Shivanna, a regular visitor to the Manipal Hospital, said he was glad that the work has begun to restore the footpath. BBMP officials, however, cited lack of funds and said the work on footpaths may not take off. “We had removed the encroachments some months ago in the entire Mahadevapura zone. But, some might have reappeared now. We will take action against repeat offenders. We need funds for the repair work,” a BBMP official told DH.	footpath damage,Bengaluru,	 Dec 11 2018
Tracking mandatory for buses, trucks from Jan 1	a vehicle location tracking system in buses and trucks. The move is aimed at making transport services safer for women and children, besides cracking down on tax evaders and misuse of permits.Rolling out the new system, the transport department has stated that the new feature will be a must in all such vehicles which will be registered from January 1.Confirming that the new feature will be rolled out from the beginning of the new year, Transport Commissioner V P Ikkeri told DH that the new system will serve many purposes.“The new system will serve various purposes, including the safety of passengers, monitoring vehicles whether it is operating within the permitted area, women safety and tracking of delivery of goods as mentioned on the Bill,” he explained.Further, Ikkeri clarified, “To begin with, the vehicle location tracking system will be installed in buses and trucks. Subsequently, the government will decide whether to implement the same in all vehicles.”According to the transport department, the owners of the vehicles themselves have to install the GPS-enabled tracking system. The details of the vehicle will be registered at a data centre controlled by a government-appointed agency.“Wherever the vehicle goes, the route will be registered at the data centre. Only the transport and police personnel, if needed, can access the details of the vehicles,” a senior official explained.All these years, the individual transport companies and privately owned transport companies had installed GPS enabled tracking devices and they were tracked by their own facilities. But with the latest system, the government will directly track the movement of vehicles. The move will also help in identifying tax evading vehicles.Number platesClose on the heels of mandating the tracking system in vehicles, the Centre has ordered the use of high-security number plates in all vehicles that will be registered from April 1, 2019.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has issued a circular to all the states. As per the latest order, vehicles manufacturers are required to install the high-security number plates and the vehicle cost will be inclusive of the number plate. “As stated by the Centre, we will only register vehicles that come with these number plates. The state has no role in this,” Ikkeri added.	Transport in Karnataka,	 Dec 11 2018
Jam alert: Over 40 roads set to be white-topped	94.5 km roads in the city, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has begun floating tenders for converting 41 more roads of 63.24 km in length into concrete stretches.With this, commuters who are already hit by ongoing work under Phase 1, have to brace themselves for more traffic jams across the city.The civic body has, in fact, floated tender for next phase before completing Phase 1.Read also: BBMP’s concrete roads a criminal waste of moneyThe work under the second phase has been divided into eight packages. According to the document accessed by DH, most of the stretches chosen are in the congested central business district (CBD) areas. The work is expected to unleash more chaos on roads.The important stretches that will be converted into concrete roads are Gandhi Bazar road, BTS Road in Wilson Garden, New BEL Road to Sanjay Nagar Main Road, Southend Road from Madhavan Park to Nettakallappa Circle, Seshadripuram Main Road, Yeshwanthpur junction to 18th Cross junction at Malleshwaram, 100 feet and 80 feet roads in Indiranagar, among others.“The second phase is divided into eight packages where 41 roads of 63.24 km will be white-topped under grants by the state government,” said a BBMP official.Read also: Flawed design an invitation to floodingOn Sunday, DH had exposed how white-topping is ruining perfectly good asphalted roads.“Since there is a delay in the work of Phase 1, we have decided not to give more than 15 roads to one contractor under the next phase. This will ensure one contractor doesn’t bag all the packages,” the official said.Speaking to DH, N Manjunath Prasad, BBMP Commissioner said, “Phase 2 of white-topping is finalised. Six packages have been already approved and the tender will be floated. Another two packages are yet to be approved. The BBMP plan is to take up white-topping in 1,400 km of city roads in the coming days.”Read also: Poor planning, worse execution: IISc expert“We are trying to minimise people’s problems; the white-topping of roads will last for 25-30 years. We have to take up this project for better, pothole-free roads,” he said.	BBMP,White topping,	 Dec 10 2018
Poor planning, worse execution: IISc expert	‘white-topping’ project is ill-conceived. Dr Ashish Verma, associate professor, transportation and systems engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru questions the very rationale for selection of roads for the Rs 986.64-crore project.“What were the problems on these roads that made the government take up this project?” he said.Slabs on the roadTechnically, it is crucial to understand why the existing bituminous roads had to make way for concrete roads.The way the project is being executed is a cause of concern. Simply putting a concrete slab over the existing road, without removing the existing road, is what is happening now. This method will substantially raise the height of the road.Also read: BBMP’s concrete roads a criminal waste of moneyThe height will rise by the thickness of the concrete slab and that changes the geometrics and cross-sectional design of the road itself. It also disturbs the drains on the side, leaving their level way below the road surface.No utility ductsAnother problem that must be looked into is the underground utilities crossing the road, especially if you are putting a concrete slab on the road.If the utility providers have to carry out maintenance, they will start digging and breaking the concrete. I don’t think provision has been made for underground utility ducts. These are glaring implementation and construction-level defects.None of the existing roads ever had a maintenance problem in the first place. It is not that bituminous roads cannot be maintained. It is because of our own practical loopholes that were weren’t able to do it.Safety at stakeIf you take a close look at the concrete stretch between Mekhri Circle and Sadashivanagar police station, where only half the road is built, you will clearly see the difference in levels. They have put a bituminous black top on the concrete road. This has lent a negative slant that is extremely dangerous for two-wheeler riders. Even light rains render the roads slippery. This means the safety of motorists is ignored. There is no warning signage on these stretches and traffic management is at its worst. There is no provision for pedestrians or cyclists either.

Flawed design an invitation to flooding	have their merits, the BBMP and the contractor are not going about the project professionally.“They are just laying the concrete roads directly above the existing roads, without any inspections on the existing sub-base. I have not seen this happen anywhere else,” he told DH, after accompanying reporters on a tour to some sites. Rajai, who specialised in energy-efficient architecture at Oxford Brookes University, UK, has worked on several big projects in Bengaluru, such as German Consulate in Bengaluru and HLC International in Chennai. US has given up on them I know concrete roads are popular in the US but only on highways, or expressways, as they call them. They don’t do it in urban centres anymore. Such roads were built in the ‘70s and ‘80s but they stopped because of safety concerns. When you have straight roads, it is all right, but when you have bends and turns, it gets extremely slippery when it rains. The concrete surface smoothens with usage. It gets smoother and smoother and this is extremely dangerous for motorists.Digging is expensiveThe maintenance is extremely expensive if you have to dig the concrete and resurface it to repair the utilities.Risk of concrete crackingThe base should be of a certain build up. It should be well-compacted and have layers of grading below. If that’s not done then it will start cracking.If the existing asphalt roads sink, the concrete roads will not sink but crack. I believe the wear and tear for vehicles is higher on concrete roads. Another problem is the glare. The concrete roads abroad are coloured but here the concrete is white, which means the glare is too harsh. This makes riding difficult.Levels are mismatched The concrete road is higher than the footpath. Had they dug up the existing road before laying the concrete road, the difference would not be there. The concrete is now at least six inches above the road. The existing properties especially houses planned with the old asphalt roads in mind, will have to raise their level as well, or live with rainwater flooding in.Drains sure to clog upAnother problem is that the depth of the drain along the footpath reduces by half or more, especially at the entrances to private properties, so the water is blocked and will spill into the houses.

White-topping of roads leaves residents in distress	"Koramangala 4th block has left the residents of the flood-prone area worried.The main concern is the height of the road, which will be more than the footpath.A resident, who did not wish to be named, said, “The BBMP is raising the height of the road by 4 inches...water does not seep through concrete roads and might eventually lead to flooding.”The resident also said that the road will be at a higher level than the footpath. “This might prevent the water from flowing through the tertiary drain, through which rainwater usually flows,” the resident added. Another resident said this could lead to two problems: water will stagnate on the footpath, causing trouble for pedestrians, and also blockage the shoulder drain.The resident also said that the BBMP has undertaken the work without removing the asphalt that was used to tar the road. ""This is a serious concern and how will the road last, if this is the case?"" he asked.Koramangala 4th block is one of the most flood-prone areas in the city. The area suffers from reverse flow of water from the stormwater drain and even from the water accumulated on roads with nowhere to flow. The residents have faced this issue even during the shortest spell of rain.Corporator Chandrappa Reddy, however, said that white topping will not lead to flooding or waterlogging in the locality."

BBMP’s concrete roads a criminal waste of money	parlance---has turned into a never-ending nightmare for citizens.The 11-month deadline to complete two packages, at a cost of Rs 986.64-crore, lapsed in July, and only about 15 per cent of the work is done.No end is in sight either, with the BBMP blaming the police for the delay, and the police saying the BBMP is blind to the city’s traffic problems. Deputy Chief Minister Dr G Parameshwara, meanwhile, says the government is negotiating rates with the contractor, and more roads will get the concrete treatment.Vijayalakshmi, 90, is just one of the many victims of the government’s callousness towards citizen interests. The concrete road in front of her house is almost a foot higher than the existing road and makes it impossible for her even to step out for a stroll.Last year, the BBMP decided to lay concrete roads on 29 stretches. The justification was that existing roads developed potholes easily, and concrete would fix the problem. Experts say the merits are exaggerated; and concrete roads---at Rs 10.44 crore a km in the present contract---are at least five times as expensive as asphalt roads.Last year, with K J George of the Congress holding the Bengaluru development portfolio, the BBMP called for tenders and assigned the job to Madhucon Projects, a Hyderabad company.The project is complicated as road projects go, with sites staggered across the city, but Kamma Srinivasa Rao of Madhucon asked no questions during the pre-bid meeting. He got the contract for two of three packages, the third going to NCC, also from Hyderabad.Read also: Poor planning, worse execution: IISc expertWork began, as specified in the contract, in August 2017. The project was to be completed by July this year. But what you see today, a good four months after the deadline lapsed, is ugly, dug-up stretches everywhere. The project is far from complete, and no one has a clue when it will be done either.“Only eight roads are done,” admits KT Nagaraj, chief engineer, projects (central), BBMP. “The project was delayed because we could not find alternative roads to divert traffic, and also because of the election code of conduct.”Both are dubious reasons: everyone knew Assembly elections were coming up, and the problem of alternative roads did not crop up suddenly out of nowhere. In other words, the BBMP went ahead with the project with the full knowledge that it would be delayed way beyond July 2018.Public projects such as this one are usually given out with a penalty clause: the contractor pays if work is not done in time. But this contractor will get away, because, as Nagaraj says, “the deadline was missed due to departmental reasons.”Citizens, meanwhile, are outraged at what has become of perfectly good roads.The traffic jams have worsened, walking on the footpaths has become impossible, and motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, risk life and limb when they go anywhere near these sites. People living along the ‘white-top’ roads face daily inconvenience in a number of ways.The BBMP claims it is saving citizens money by going in for concrete roads. “White-topping roads last 20 to 30 years and do not require any major maintenance. India spends nearly 70 per cent of its road sector budget only on maintenance of bituminous roads, which is a waste of taxpayers’ money,” says Nagaraj.He says the project was taken up on the basis of a study by the Central Road Research Institute, Delhi. “We also studied similar projects in Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai,” he says.Not everyone is convinced. The design is clearly flawed, says Saveri Rajai, well-known architect.“The roads are a thick slab, about 20 cm higher than existing roads and footpaths, and block the shoulder drains. This is an invitation to water-logging and sewage blocks,” Saveri says.A team of DH reporters visited Basavangudi and found ample evidence of the problems Saveri warns about.‘White-topping’ isn’t helping a city grappling with monstrous traffic. Mysuru Road, already a busy and often choked stretch, is now beset with longer delays.At the Satellite Bus Stand, the hub for all KSRTC buses plying towards Mysuru, people now spend longer hours idling in acrid smoke.Ninety-year-old Vijayalakshmi has been a resident of Basavanagudi for as long as she can remember.Also read: Flawed design an invitation to floodingShe is now confined to her house because the concrete road that the contractor has built in front of her house is too high for her.The otherwise normal road, along Krishna Rao Park, took on an abnormal height after white-topping began. Like at other places, no one has a clue when the work will be completed.Dr Vikram Kashyap, retired neurosurgeon and her son, explains the ordeal: “If I have to take her out, I put a few stones near the road to make a sort of rough incline and then take out the car. There are so many roads with potholes in Bengaluru but Madhav Rao Circle was one of the good stretches.”Problems have multiplied: citizens can’t take their vehicles out because of the mess the BBMP has created in one of Bengaluru’s best-planned, pre-Independence neighbourhoods.Residents, motorists, traders and hawkers---practically everyone who uses the stretch that connects Basavanagudi to the rest of the city---tell you the concrete roads project has destroyed stretches that were in top condition.“Now it is a financial and civic nightmare,” Dr Kashyap says. “The monumental incompetence of the people behind this exercise is to be seen to be believed.”Another development that infuriates people is that the height of the concrete road causes flooding.“Every time it rains, all the rubbish from the road flows into our house. During dry weather, the wind blows rubbish into these places which have turned into veritable ditches,” Dr Kashyap says.With construction debris everywhere, walking on the road is not safe anymore. Dr Kashyap is afraid the hazards could kill.“Could these people not have thought of these things? I feel there are more tragedies waiting to happen,” he observes.Shops and establishments in the area say their business has come down by half. Kaushik Gopal and Chikke Gowda, employees SRS petrol bunk, vouch for it.“Earlier, we used to have many customers come in on their way to work. Now, this road has been rendered one-way and so they skip coming here altogether,” says Kaushik Gopal, manager of the large fuel station.Water from the concrete road flows in even there. “Traffic jams were unheard of on this road and now they are a permanent feature,” says Chikke Gowda. Dr Kashyap is livid at how citizens’ interests are sacrificed by vested interests. “This is not just an abdication of responsibility but conspiracy and collusion between politicians, bureaucrats and almost every single institution. I have seen an elderly citizen who was trying to park on the side of the road. His car got stuck in the gap between the road and the footpath and he had a very tough time getting it out,” he says.Giving staggered permission: Traffic police chief The traffic police had rejected permission for the BBMP to lay concrete roads, but after Additional Commissioner of Police (traffic) P Harishekaran took charge, he has given the green signal for work on five roads.“I have given permission for work on 300 metres every day,” he told DH. The BBMP never finishes work within the stipulated time, and ends up compounding traffic woes, police complain.In August 2018, the Karnataka chief secretary intervened and got the BBMP and the police to the negotiating table. The main reason for the police to reject permission is the lack of alternative roads. A police officer said, “The BBMP must show alternative routes, but they fail to show any.”The BBMP says important stretches have no alternative roads, but the question remains: ‘Why didn’t it think of this problem before giving out the contracts?’KT Nagaraj, chief engineer, projects (central), BBMP, says, “Diverting traffic in a city like Bengaluru is not possible. There are no alternative roads, for instance, to Mysuru Road.”The traffic police had also written to the BBMP to even out the edges of concrete roads; they are a safety hazard, especially for two-wheeler riders.“We are filling the edges and placing concrete blocks to prevent accidents,” Nagaraj says, but the DH team did not find evidence of any of it at many locations.Snail’s paceThe BBMP has given contracts to Madhucon Projects, a Hyderabad company, to lay concrete roads on 94.5 km in Bengaluru. The deadline lapsed four months ago, but only about 15 per cent of the work is done.	BBMP,InSight,	 Dec 09 2018
Land acquisition delays work on Iblur- Carmelaram 	from Iblur to Carmelaram in East Bengaluru is still in its preliminary stage.The land acquisition process has been the biggest challenge for the government.The six-lane 150 feet wide road with two two-lane slip roads on both the sides along with 3-metre wide footpaths was included in BBMP’s action plan last year.The 8-km road is the main access way to many top IT companies and commercial malls in Mahadevapura. The bad condition of the road was also recently brought to the notice of Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy by Wipro Chairman Azim Premji at a meeting in Vidhana Soudha, after which the chief minister had asked the BBMP to complete the work by November.As many landowners are not ready to accept the TDR (Transfer of Development Rights) as an alternative to cash, as the project is being executed at a snail’s pace.“A few landowners have relinquished their properties for road widening. But a few corporate companies and builders are demanding cash as compensation. This settlement is taking time. Hence, we cannot assure the exact date of completion of the project,” said Somashekar, chief engineer (road infrastructure).Though some considerable amount of work is visible on the ground, the commuters expressed their dissatisfaction about the slow pace.“The road widening work was announced so many times by the governments before. We are happy that it has started. But they are still just digging the shoulder drain for the last one year. Mahadevapura ward pays the highest taxes to the government but in return, we get very little compared to smaller wards like HSR or Koramangala,” said Rohin Govindarajan, a resident of Sarjapur Road.“The drainage work is going on at those points wherever the land has been granted to us. We can begin the work at other places once we get the land. We regret the inconvenience caused to the commuters as they are stuck in traffic jams due to the ongoing work,” Somashekar added.The work will be completed in two years, said BBMP officials.

Farmers, residents rue land acquired for projects	acquired for various development projects in and around Kempegowda International Airport, have not received monetary compensation even after many years in Devanahalli constituency.This is one of the major problems the people in and around Devanahalli face and was voiced out by many at ‘Janaspandana: Citizens for Change’, a Deccan Herald and Prajavani event, held at Dr BR Ambedkar Bhavan in Devanahalli constituency on Friday.“The government has paid a compensation of merely Rs 6 lakh to Rs 20 lakh to the farmers here. If the government further asks the farmers to pay the toll, it is unacceptable. I will raise the issue in the cabinet,” said Devanahalli MLA Nisarga Narayanaswamy.‘No dearth of problems’Addressing the event, he said: “There is no dearth of problems in the constituency here. We have to resolve them keeping the time in mind. Citizens should not sit at home after registering their complaints. They should go behind the officials and get them resolved at the earliest.”Rangaswamy G, a resident of the constituency, said: “I had four acres of land in Anneshwara village in survey number 37/21. The KIADB acquired the land. But I have not received a compensation for 20 years. If they provide at least one acre of land, it will help us to eke our livelihood.”Responding to this, Rajanna, tahsildar, said: “Bring the necessary documents to my office on Monday, and we will ensure that justice is done to you.”Another resident, Chandrashekar Balepur said: “The airport authority acquired my grandfather’s land many years ago. Till now, we have not received the compensation. The government is not even considering our applications to provide the compensation.”The tahsildar responded: “If there is no approval from the land acquisition department, we cannot provide the compensation. If you bring the related documents on Wednesday, we can check.”Another group of residents from Murthy Hakkupete, Devanahalli said: “The place where Akash Hospital has been built was at first allotted to build homes for the poor people. Please provide some places for poor people.”The chairman of Murthy Township said: “A case in the court is going on in this regard. Fifty title deeds have been given. But they have not built any houses. If we receive directions from the court, we will act accordingly.”A farmer complained about the BMTC collecting excessing fare in buses. Venkatesh, the leader of a farmer’s association, said: “Due to the toll collected at Devanahalli, the passengers travelling in BMTC buses are shelling out Rs 6 extra every time. Buses going to Chikkaballapur from Bengaluru do not stop at Devanahalli bus stand, inconveniencing passengers. Sometimes, conductors do not allow students with bus passes to board buses.”To this S K Hiremath, BMTC official for Devanahalli replied: “The increase in toll collection is the Central government’s decision. We will make arrangements for buses to stop at bus stops. I will also discuss the matter with the MLA. We will also deploy buses to Vijayapura.”Highlighting lack of streetlights in Devanahalli, G S Raveendra, a member of the town panchayat, said: “From the toll gate to Devanahalli, please provide streetlights as it will help in preventing accidents on the route. Also, put up barricades and build a service road to ease congestion.MLA Nisarga Narayanaswamy said, “We will take necessary measures in the public interest.”“I do not have much experience in politics as I am the first-time MLA. But I am aware of the problems here. I had taken up the issue of excess fare being collected in BMTC buses and it was resolved in the previous meeting. The officials had agreed not to collect the toll from people. I do not know how has this problem resurfaced,” said Nisarga Narayanaswamy.He said in six months, he has received Rs 70 crore fund from the state government for constituency development works and will undertake the work soon.

Five-storeyed building tilts in Marathahalli	tilted dangerously and was on the verge of collapse. Luckily, the BBMP officials rushed to the spot and tackled the situation on Friday.According to the fire control room the incident took place on Thursday late night at Aswath Nagar, 6th Cross, near Marathahalli.“Fire safety advance rescue van and team hit the spot immediately, and stabilised the building with earth movers support,” said Prasadh Reddy, a resident.“A team of building demolishing experts from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike carried out the dismantling of the building structure manually and cautiously. The neighbours and the building occupants were evacuated, and no one was harmed in the process,” Reddy added.Speaking to DH, Assistant Executive Engineer Prakash said: “The building owner violated the rules and constructed ground floor plus four floors. The structure was supposed to have just three floors. As it could not withstand the pressure, the building tilted.”“Now, we are demolishing the building to avoid any further damages. No one was harmed as people evacuated the building soon after the tilt was brought to their notice, Prakash said.“The owner of the building is facing the legal actions, and now he is in police custody,” the officer added.

‘Punish officials who let pollution in lakes’	to Karnataka to identify and punish errant officials who failed to check pollution in Bellanduru, Varthur and Agara lakes.The NGT, which passed an order to restore the major lakes, asked the agencies trusted with the upkeep of the lakes to identify the errant officials and take action. The order also said their lapses should be recorded in their annual confidential reports.The order applies to both present and past officials, the tribunal added, observing that the concerned officials have miserably failed to discharge their obligations to the society.The bench, headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, said the Additional Chief Secretary of the Urban Development Department must identify the officials responsible for implementing the lake revival plan in the coming days.Failure to implement the task should be recorded in the officials’ career progressive records, the tribunal said.Penalties on the publicThe bench also asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to prepare, in a month, guidelines on the scale of penalties on individuals and institutions for non-compliance to control pollution in Bengaluru lakes. The bench also asked the CPCB to prepare guidelines on waste management within one month, Sajan Poovayya, advocate for Namma Bengaluru Foundation, said. Justice Santosh Hegde-headed committee will decide the additional amount required to set up the STPs (Sewage Treatment Plants) to be provided by the state, which is liable to pay interest for delay or non-payment.The tribunal also asked the Karnataka government to follow the May 31, 2018 Panjwani committee recommendations on restoring the lakes.Ram Prasad, the advocate representing JD(S) Rajya Sabha MP Kupendra Reddy said no waste should be disposed in lakes and rajakaluves.

Underpass being repaired to ease traffic at Belegere	for its pathetic condition, so far. But looks like it is on the betterment path now.One of the abandoned underpasses in Belagere is being repaired for the convenience of commuters.One of the underpasses near the Belegere Lake, which the commuters chose not to use as it is in a bad state, is now being restored.“The underpass will be ready for use by two-wheelers by Tuesday. Most of the apartment dwellers staying close to the lake can use the underpass to hit the outer-ring road,” said Pushpa Manjunath, local corporator.All vehicles moving on the Panathur-Belegere road to hit the outer ring road have to pass through another main underpass, where the commuters get stranded for hours together.But now with the repair of the abandoned underpass, the traffic might ease a bit.“The railway underpass on the Panathur-Belegere road is too narrow that only one heavy vehicle can pass through it at a time. Adding to the problem, a large number of water tankers choke the road. Sometimes, it takes more than three hours to get rid of this 1.5 km stretch. Besides, the road is sludgy and slippery,” said Vijay Thomas, a commuter.The residents want the road to be repaired soon.“We need streetlights. Traffic officials need to set some particular time for water tankers as they block the road during peak hours,” he added.“The executive engineer of Mahadevapura divison (major roads) was supposed to pay some amount to the railway department. Now, that he has paid it, the railway department should handover the underpass expansion project to an agency. If that happens, the Panathur-Belegere road is sorted,” said Pushpa Manjunath.

Water expo: extracting the last drop from sewage	and extract the last drop of clean water. At least the entrepreneurs at the Water Expo believe that’s the case.The Expo being held at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC) has more than 70 companies in attendance. They have set up stalls showcasing the latest technology for treating sewage water. From natural treatment to standard mechanical processes to an automated system where one can control a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) sitting on a sofa, an array of exhibits will surely impress water conservationists.A spokesperson for Water Today, which has organised the three-day expo, said water conservation will gain more importance in the coming years as deficiency of rain and depleting ground water will put pressure on policymakers to recycle water.“Twin policies of creating awareness and setting up mandatory STPs will go a long way in reducing water wastage, and checking the pollution of water bodies. We have already realised water can’t be taken for granted. The coming years will see its value go up and rules will be framed accordingly,” he said. Besides home-grown companies, many have come from New Delhi, Chennai and Andhra Pradesh among other places. A Mysuru-based firm exhibited a modular STP that can treat up to 600 litres of sewage per day - offering services on rent.STP automationBengaluru-based K Sridhar and Kannan Pasupathiraj were demonstrating their STP system, built with German technology, that can be monitored online. “The idea is to make an STP as simple and silent as a refrigerator while being adaptable to tanks with a capacity of 1 to 5 kilo litres per day or even more,” said Sridhar.When they realised that people were ready to spend on STPs, but not to hire a person for upkeep, Pasupathiraj decided to add the remote-control mechanism. “Sitting here, I can control the plant we have set up for a company in Chennai,” he said, showing a web page displaying hourly updates on the tank, starting from the state of waste water to its contents as well as the power supply variations.Rohan Rane showcased a model from a Delhi-based firm that employs Phytorid technology devoid of chemicals. He said the simple construction and low-cost tech can be employed to revive lakes as well.Also on display were smart devices that help cut water wastage, and new developments in reverse osmosis technology.

BDA, police clear rundown underside of Hebbal flyover	worried of the rampant illegal activities there anymore.The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) has cleared the clump of shrubs, illegal constructions and the garbage piles below the flyover. They have also cleared the untended thickets in the mini-forest adjacent to the flyover towards the Manyata Tech Park.This was done at the behest of the Bengaluru law and order and traffic police officials. The police were receiving complaints from commuters about the ‘anti-social activities’ in the area.The police have also caught many under suspicious circumstances from under the flyover.“On investigation, the police found that illegal activities were thriving because the area was rundown with shrubbery, and the maintenance was irregular. Since the flyover is still under the custody of the BDA, they approached us. We have cleared all the bushes under the flyover and in the mini-forest too. We have installed street lights as well,” said a senior BDA official.BDA executed the work in the last two days (Tuesday and Wednesday). There is also a plan to deploy security guards under the flyover and in the mini-forest patch near the Kempegowda statue.The BDA will thereafter beautify the area with lawns so that people come for walks. “The idea is that once people start frequenting the place, illegal activities will stop. Since it is en route to the international airport, such occurrences are a blot on the reputation of the city. To make the place look more attractive, public utility services and an amusement park will be introduced in the mini-forest. The area below the flyover will be landscaped as well,” the official added.Around three years ago, BDA started landscaping the area under the flyover. But it did not take off because it was decided to add loops to the flyover.	BDA,Hebbal Flyover,	 Dec 06 2018

Govt moves to regulate housing maintenance charges	maintenance charges collected by the apartment associations in the city, the state government has issued a circular that urges apartment associations to register themselves under The Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959.In the wake of increasing complaints on financial misappropriation by apartment associations, the Registrar of Co-operative Societies has said - in a circular dated November 30 - not to register under the Karnataka Society Registration Act, 1960. This Act does not have specific regulations regarding the financial practices undertaken by the associations.“The societies which fall under the Karnataka Apartment Ownership Act, 1972 are not to be registered under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, 1960,” states the circular, as the latter provides registration for promotion of charity, education, science, literature, fine arts, foundation, maintenance of libraries, reading rooms, public museums, galleries and so on, but not for financial practices.Referring to the circular, M K Aiyappa, Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Karnataka State said, “All the apartment complexes, associations or societies charge for maintenance and indulge in other financial activities, but there is no proper regulation if they do not register under Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 or Karnataka Ownership Flat Act, 1972.”The move is important, as the apartment associations can now approach an authorised body to conduct enquiries, if there are any complaints related to financial aspects. Welcoming the move, M S Shankar, secretary, Forum for People’s Collective Efforts said, “This has been a long pending move and we welcome the directive. Most apartment associations are not indulging in any charity related work or welfare, but are collecting maintenance charges only to look after themselves.”“Residents living in apartment complexes own an undivided share of land. They cannot enjoy privileges on the entire complex, as per their desires,” said Shankar. Aiyappa added that some of the apartment associations have already registered under the Act, but for those not registered, it is mandatory to do so under the Karnataka Co-Operative Societies Act or Karnataka Flat Ownership Act, to bring in financial accountability.	apartments,The Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act,	 Dec 04 2018

Lokayukta probe into sand mining at Sarjapur Lake	illegal sand extraction from Doddakere Lake in southeastern Bengaluru’s Sarjapur.Based on news reports about illegal extraction and transportation of sand from the lake, the Lokayukta has initiated an enquiry and has issued notices to the officials concerned, including the superintendent of police, Bengaluru Rural, for immediate action against those indulging in sand extraction.“The news reports indicate that the extraction of sand from Doddakere lake and lake bed has been going on for some time and the officers concerned have failed to act and take appropriate legal action to prevent such illegal extraction of sand. It is needless to point out that illegal extraction of sand is an offence within the meaning of Section 379 of the IPC,” Lokayukta Justice P Vishwanath Shetty stated in the order.The Lokayukta stated that activities concerning minor minerals such as quarrying, extraction and transportation of sand would be in contravention of rules 42 and 44 of KMMC Rules (Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession) as the sand belongs to the state.The residents living around the Doddakere lake, one of the biggest lakes in Anekal taluk, had raised concern about incessant digging at the lake and lake bed area throughout the night. The residents alleged that the local police had not taken any action.Notices issuedThe Lokayukta has issued a notice to Deputy Commissioner (Bengaluru Rural), Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Panchayat Bengaluru Urban district, the Director of Mines and Geology Department and SP Bengaluru Rural.The Lokayukta has asked the deputy commissioner and the Zilla Panchayat chief executive officer to conduct an enquiry.

Six-lane highway will choke Bengaluru, Mysuru	choke both the cities in the future. The increased carriageway will add more vehicles unless the system supports high capacity transport arrangements like a High Speed Rail (HSR) or a Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS), Ashish Verma, an expert at the IISc warned.The Rs 7,000 crore project envisions a six-lane, 117 km-long highway, which includes elevated corridors of about 8 km, and several bridges. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari announced on Friday that the work on the 'economic corridor' will start from January.Verma, Associate Professor of Transport Systems Engineering at the IISc, said though the widened road will help faster mobility between the cities in the beginning, the space will saturate as the vehicle numbers go up.Besides, it is also important to analyse whether the roads within Bengaluru and Mysuru have the capacity to handle the high amount of traffic that the widened roads will bring.“Sustainable urban growth is possible when such capital intensive projects incorporate high capacity systems. Dedicated lanes to support BRTS should be planned. This will ensure that people will eventually shift to public transport. As land acquisition is a major headache, a small patch along the corridor could have been reserved for HSR,” Verma said.The Railway Board is considering a feasibility report for HSR corridor between Chennai and Mysuru via Bengaluru. The proposed HSR is expected to reduce by half the travel duration between Bengaluru and Chennai from five hours to 2 hours and 20 minutes. The Bengaluru-Mysuru commute would come down to less than an hour.Reduce pressure on BengaluruVerma noted that the BRTS and HSR have the capacity to reduce pressure on Bengaluru, which is struggling to support increasing number of industries with limited infrastructure and resources.The high capacity systems that offer reliability will distribute growth to different cities and reduce the burden on Bengaluru. “Alleviating excessively high urban concentration requires investments in inter-regional transport and telecommunications to facilitate deflection of economic activities from megacities,” Verma said in a recent paper.

School vehicles causing traffic chaos in CBD: Motorists	St Mark’s Road is causing traffic chaos, complain motorists.The vehicles that ferry students are parked on the main road though the schools have enough space on their premises. The school buses, vans and other private vehicles parked haphazardly outside many schools in the central business district (CBD) has led to traffic bottlenecks on Brigade Road, MG Road, Richmond Road and surrounding roads. The traffic police have been working hard to beat the problem, every day.Sangeetha Krishnan, a motorist who takes this stretch to go towards MG Road, said, “The main reason for traffic snarls in this stretch is the vehicles lining up to pick up and drop children.”“Parents double-park on the road though parking is restricted. Pedestrians are forced to walk on the road as the footpaths are taken up.”Several schools in the city advanced timing a few years ago from 8 am to 3 pm to avoid clashing with office timings so that there is no traffic congestion around schools.But it has not led to any solution, said Ramesh Reddy, a resident of Lavelle Road. “Cars, private transport vehicles and vans that come to pick up kids continue to stop haphazardly in front of schools. The school management has to control the vehicles and find alternative measures,” he said.The residents also complained about incessant honking and the need to protect schoolchildren from the risk of serious accidents.M N Srihari, a traffic expert and a former advisor to the state government on matters of traffic and infrastructure, said: “These schools are violating the law. There is a rule in the education department that the schools should be given permission only if they have adequate parking area inside there premises.”“Both the school management and the police are not following the rules to avoid the school vans parking on the road. Police have all the right to take action against the school management,” Srihari added.To resolve this rising problem, the city traffic top brass will ask all schools in the CBD to find parking for their vehicles within the campus.Additional Commissioner (Traffic) P Harishekaran said, “We will direct school managements to use the grounds or the adequate space inside the school premises to avoid traffic jams.”	Central Business District,school vehicles,traffic congestion,	 Dec 04 2018

Malleswaram senior citizens want footpaths	on the footpaths of Malleswaram on Sunday highlighting the pathetic condition of the pedestrian walkways in the area.Malleswaram Social, a citizen group of the area, a month ago had come up with a Bharatanatyam video, which satirical portrayed the difficulties the residents face while navigating the footpaths in the one of the oldest residential areas of the city.The video had gone viral on the social media platforms. The residents are campaigning for the better footpath under #footpathbeku campaign(we want footpaths) from the last few months.As the second part of the campaign, senior citizens gathered at the 15th Cross at 10 am and took out a short silent walk, to demonstrate the difficulties the senior citizens face while walking on the footpaths.Radhika Prasad, a member of the forum said: “The footpaths in the area are in a bad condition, and most of the walking paths are constructed in an unscientific way where the bumps give senior citizens an uncomfortable walking experience.”Meet corporator, tooThe citizens also meet Manjunath Raju, Kadu Malleswaram corporator, who promised to solve the issues.Suchitra Srinivasan Deep, the co-founder of the platform, said: “Footpaths are the basic necessities for any city. Our footpaths are badly designed, poorly maintained and encroached upon. But none of these seems to really worry the citizens. We have the right to ask for footpath and their maintenance. The administration is not the only stakeholder to be blamed for this. All of us are responsible in some way or the other.”“Hence we have to create awareness among the citizens for the walkable footpath. We hope this campaign will take us together to get a pedestrian-friendly footpath in our area,” she added.	Malleswaram,Footpath,	 Dec 03 2018
Govt land worth Rs 176 cr reclaimed from encroachers	land, Bengaluru District administration on Saturday launched simultaneous encroachment eviction drive in all the five taluks of Bengaluru Urban district.Following a day-long drive against land encroachers led by deputy commissioner of Bengaluru Urban district B M Vijayashankar, a total of 25.26 acres of government land worth Rs 176 crore was recovered.According to sources in the revenue department, the highest extent of encroachment was cleared in Anekal taluk.“A total of 8.61 acres of encroached land worth Rs 36 crore was recovered. All these were the lake areas, located on the periphery of the waterbodies,” said C Mahadevaiah, tahsildar, Anekal.Similarly, in Yelahanka taluk also the officials reclaimed the encroached government land.Even though the locals threatened to stage a protest and gathered in large numbers, the deputy commissioner himself led the officials with police support and reclaimed more than 3 acres of land worth Rs 65 crore.The encroached lands were identified in Puttenahalli, Kogilu and Honnenahalli villages of Yelahanka taluk.	government land,Encroachments,	 Dec 02 2018
BTP moots bus station to fix Silk Board Junction mess	to construct a bus station at the traffic-prone Silk Board junction.Speaking at the “DH & Citizen for Civic amenities” event on Saturday, Additional Commissioner (Traffic) P Harishekaran revealed that his department has conducted a study on the Silk Board junction and found that the one of the main reason for traffic jams on this stretch is buses.“I have voluntarily studied silk board junction traffic chaos. There is a one acre land on the stretch. My officers have proposed to the BDA, BBMP and BMTC to construct a bus station so that the traffic will be reduced,” said P Harishekaran.The traffic police chief also highlighted the need for scientific bus bays in the city. “There is a lack of bus bays hence the buses occupy the service road. For instance, there is no bus bay from Cauvery theatre to International Airport,” he said.“I have approached the BBMP and BMTC to have bus bays while constructing the roads. In the main arterial roads and sub-arterial roads, there are no bus bays. So if two or three buses stop one behind the other there will be a queue of 400 to 500 vehicles,” he added.“For solving the parking problem in the city, the government should bring in a parking policy,” Harishekaran suggested. “We don’t have larger space for public parking in almost all the main areas. We are compromising road space for public parking” he added.Speaking about the elevated corridor project, Harishekaran said, “We have to implement the project as per the government’s direction. I have requested the chief minister to consider having a traffic police,” he said.Bengaluru is expanding in a circular way, unlike Chennai and Mumbai where South-North expansion is prevailing. Therefore, traffic congestion on all the roads is in a circular form, Harishekaran said while dubbing Bengaluru a ‘Chakravyuha’.	Bengaluru Traffic Police,Silk Board,traffic congestion,	 Dec 02 2018
Part of Cottonpete road caves in	Saturday morning, troubling motorists along the stretch.The BBMP officials claimed that a stormwater drain (SWD) pipeline running beneath the road was the cause for the damage.According to N Chidananda, joint commissioner, BBMP, West zone: “A very old SWD runs under the road. This line is minimum 20 feet below the asphalted road and we were not aware of this until now. A thick slab was covering the pipeline and it is fully covered with mud. The BBMP later asphalted the road.”Chidananda also said the SWD was connected with a valley, mostly Vrishabhavathi, and sewage was entering the SWD.“Unfortunately, similar to other cities, most SWDs in our city carry sewage water instead of rainwater and this one in Cottonpete is no different,” he said.The traffic police were the first to swing into action when the road caved in. They barricaded the area, preventing any vehicles or pedestrians from falling into the pit.Later, the BBMP officials came to take measures. “We have taken temporary measures to make the road motorable,” the joint commissioner said.He said a permanent solution to fix the problem would also be taken.“We will coordinate with Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) officials to resolve the issue,” he said.Meanwhile, mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun said she had spoken to BWSSB Chairman Tushar Girinath about the issue.“This SWD under the road may be close to 100 years old. The road should be repaired with much care and precision or the damage could manifold in the coming days,” she said.The BBMP also plans to take up the stretch under its TenderSURE project, where separate utility ducts would be provided for power, underground cables and sewage lines along the side of the road.

After ward meetings, Mayor pushes for zonal level meets	mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun has proposed the officials to hold zonal level meetings across all eight zones.In a letter to Bruhat Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, the mayor has proposed to direct joint commissioners of all zones to hold meetings at zonal levels so that issues get resolved before they reach the BBMP council meeting.Speaking to reporters during the ward committee meeting held at Jayanagar ward on Saturday, she said: “I have asked the commissioner to issue a circular regarding this during the last week. The zonal officials can collate the data gathered from ward committee meetings and try to resolve issues holistically in each zone.”However, this is not the first time that such a move has been made, said Gangambike.“There was a similar proposal long back, during the time of former mayor G Padmavathi. But that proposal was not mooted further. If we indeed implement this move, there will be decentralisation of work and the strength of the council meeting can be utilised for other larger issues,” she said.It is proposed that the zonal level officers can hold such meetings, with the collaboration of officials from other government agencies such as Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited, police and so on, once in two weeks.

Finding solution for Bengaluru traffic	"country, after Kolkata. With 79 lakh vehicles plying on roads meant for just 15 lakh, the city is choking.Citizens for Civic Amenities organised by Deccan Herald for a discussion on the city's traffic woes at the Chancery Pavilion on Saturday. The discussion mainly focused on the reasons and solution for the existing traffic chaos. The prevailing condition is very heartbreaking that the commuters skip buses the moment they can afford two-wheelers and cars. Also, there are just 4,600 officers in the city’s 44 traffic police stations, 662 short of the sanctioned strength of 5,262, says reports. The event was attended by well-known panellists Ashish Verma, Mobility Expert (IIsc), B Basavaaraju IAS (Principal Secretary, Transport department), B Basavaaraju IAS (Transport Department), P Harishekharan IPS ( Bengaluru City Police) and Vinay Srinivasa, Advocate (Citizen activity for Mobility).One of the Panelists Vinay Srinivasa shared data on vehicles in Bengaluru. ""We went from 50 lakh vehicles to 75 lakh in a span of 5 years. In the same period (2013-2018), our BMTC bus fleet expanded by just 50"", says Srinivasa.He also added that the Lack of planning has resulted in the present traffic situation in the city because the planning of residential sectors are not done properly while creating IT & BT sectors. This has led to clogging of roads during morning and evening peak hours in the city. Transport principal secretary B Basavaraju says more coordination is the key to tackling transport issues.Daily commuter Rajashekhar said that the city's infrastructure is good, but for technology to provide solutions, behavioural changes are needed from both city and citizens. The city needs to be introduced of 100 new feeder midi buses can help ease traffic.

Siddhapura-Nellurahalli road work stalled for no reason	"a month-and-a-half ago, and not before protests by residents, the BBMP is dragging its feet on finishing it.Work on the road, which has been pending for the past three years, seemed to be progressing well when the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike seemingly turned its back.Residents complain about how the roads have been abandoned and garbage is dumped.""We have no idea why they stopped the work now,"" said Poornima, a resident of Siddhapura. ""They've covered the road with sand, gravel and crushed stone and left it. They haven't built the sidewalks and garbage is being dumped on either side.""Private school buses cram the road during the peak hours, Poornima complained, adding that the road is the only shortcut for the techies to reach their offices at Old Airport Road and ITPL. ""The BBMP has turned a blind eye to the road for many years,"" she said.Residents said the project to widen the road had to be given up several years ago after some landowners refused to make space.""Mahadevapura MLA Aravind Limbavali got the road repaired and asphalted in 2015, but the road has since worn out,"" said another resident, Komal P.Palike officials, however, assure that the road work is going on without a hitch. ""We've started the repair work a few days ago and will asphalt the road soon,"" said a BBMP official."	Siddhapura-Nellurahalli road,BBMP,	 Nov 30 2018
Corporators urge mayor to probe pvt hospitals	to medical negligence by a private hospital, the fellow corporators urged the mayor to conduct a probe, and initiate legal actions against the offenders.During the council meeting on Thursday, the corporators expressed malaise about Elumalai’s health.Elumalai,the corporator of Sagayapuram, who went to get a small abscess removed from his nose, slipped into a coma after an alleged medical negligence.According to reports, his family alleged that anaesthesia overdose was responsible for this condition and sought the hospital be shut. He was admitted to Santhosh hospital in Frazer Town from where he was shifted to Vikram hospital.The fellow corporators during the meeting said many such hospitals have turned into ‘death centres’. They urged the mayor to initiate an investigation into all the private hospitals in the city and cancel the trade licenses of those involved in unlawful activities.They also sought mayor Gangambike to get the official medical report of Elumalai, investigate and initiate legal actions against Santhosh hospital to which the mayor agreed.The corporators also said the government should keep a watch on medical camps organised by non-government organisations (NGOs).“Many NGOs conduct medical camps without a no-objection certificate from the BBMP. So the BBMP should consider this issue and prevent any medical tragedies in future,” said one of the corporators.The mayor said the investigation into the private hospitals needs to be carried out by the principal secretary or commissioner of health and family welfare services, health secretary or commissioner.“I will bring the matter to their notice,” said Gangambike.

Indian Oil sets up fuel station near airport	Airport (KIA) do not have to make the 8-km run to the toll gate as a new fuel station near the Trumpet flyover will cut the distance by half.Indian Oil has started trial operation of the station owned and operated by the company on the KIA premises, about 4 km from the airport’s parking lot. The new facility is located near the roundabout closest to Trumpet junction.An IOC spokesperson said the fuel station will be of help to not only the growing traffic to the airport but also to about 20,000 workforce. Till now, the nearest station for refuelling petrol or diesel vehicle was located about 8 km from the airport near the toll gate on Ballari Road with the alternative station on the Devanahalli situated about 10 km away.

Better access means more water consumption in city	per person a day is an acceptable limit for water consumption. But Bengaluru residents are consuming a much higher volume of water daily.Individual consumption in several areas in the city has been averaging over 200 litres. Experts attribute proximity to the storage area, better access and economic strata as factors influencing water consumption. A R Shivakumar, Principal Scientific Officer, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology said that on an average, an individual might require about 96 litres of water for domestic consumption daily.“The supply of water differs in various parts of the city. While some have supply every alternate day, other areas get it only once in three days,” he said.He added that those living close to reservoirs or pumping stations have a better water supply.According to Shivakumar the rise in the number of multi-storey buildings could also be a contributor. “What was once a single house could now have several floors but only one water connection. This could also reflect as high consumption,” he said adding that one must also take into account, consumption of water from other sources.Dr Kemparamaiah, Chief Engineer, BWSSB said that the disparity in water consumption could be dependent on several factors. “They might not have sought a BWSSB connection. Some of them have old pipes and with some it could be case-specific issues,” he said.He said that Bengaluru’s water consumption was unlike other cities including Singapore, Delhi or Hyderabad. “Some of them have access to bore wells while multi-storey buildings get water from tankers,” he added.

BMRCL seeks $500M loan for airport metro	with the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) seeking a loan worth 500 million USD. The BMRCL will also request Rs 500 crore as aid from the Centre. The move comes after a proposal to raise funds through the User Development Fee (UDF) has been put off.Managing Director Ajay Seth said the corporation is looking for the $500 million, ideally in a long-term loan of up to 20 years with a moderate interest rate. The formal request for a loan has to go through the Union government. “We have held a discussion with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The request is yet to be sent to the Union government,” he said.The BMRCL is trying to shore up funds for the project after the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) in June blocked a proposal to raise Rs 1,000 crore through UDF. As per the AERA ruling, additional UDF can be levied after the metro services begin.The corporation will also seek Rs 500 crore from the Centre as per the new metro policy, where the Union government will provide 10% of the cost for a project, raising funds through innovative financing models.As per the financial plan approved by the cabinet, the state government is expected to pitch in Rs 1,250 crore, and the Centre, Rs 500 crore (8.40% of the project’s cost).The alignment of the metro line to the airport is likely to be revised with the BMRCL planning to connect the line at Hebbal instead of Nagavara.

Pipe-laying, white-topping congest BTS road	wait for at least three more months for a smooth ride.Due to the ongoing pipe-laying by the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), and the scheduled Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) work, motorists and pedestrians are having a difficult time.While the BWSSB is laying new sanitary pipelines along the road, the BBMP is to begin the white-topping project next week.The BWSSB’s work in progress has resulted in huge piles of mud dumped along the side of the road.A shopkeeper in the area, who did not wish to be named said, “The number of customers visiting our shop has reduced, due to the huge mud-pile that is like a wall, blocking visibility.”Raksha Uday, a regular commuter said, “The BWSSB has dug up deep trenches to lay pipelines. It is next to impossible for pedestrians to walk on the road. Only motorists and cars can move.”According to D Chandrappa, area councillor of the Hombegowda Nagar ward, the work is expected to continue for at least three more months.“The BWSSB is replacing the sanitary pipelines with new ones, as there was reverse flow of sewage during rains. This was leading to severe clogging. We are re-laying the new pipeline as a solution to the existing problem,” said Chandrappa.He also said that the BWSSB work has to be completed before the BBMP can start the white-topping.“Recently, we have filled potholes on the road. But the white-topping will take some time and we are hoping to complete the BWSSB work before that,” he said.Recently, the BBMP received clearance from Bangalore Traffic Police to divert the traffic on the BTS road to alternative roads, so that the civic body can undertake the work. BBMP will white-top the stretch from KH road to Mico road, and the traffic will be diverted to the 12th cross road, Wilson Garden.	Road congestion,	 Nov 25 2018
Elevator safety: Rising high and falling low	open spaces although the compromise is very often criticised for leaning heavily in favour of spreading the concrete cover rather than green. Naturally, this leads to land price hike, high population concentration and a struggle to retain green cover. All of these have led to a rise in high-rise buildings, and by implication, elevators.Increase in building height necessitates innovative technologies to ensure optimal use of space and user convenience. Safety being the top priority, considerable effort is required to choose the right technology for elevators.Interactions by DH at many apartments showed this emphasis on safety: This clearly came through at Sanathana Chamanthi, Seegehalli, near Kadugodi, at Krishna Prakash apartments of Aicoboonagar, at Nandi Enclave of Banashankari 3rd stage, and at VVR Supreme Residency of Uttarahalli. Apartment association members were all fully aware of the critical link between safety and good maintenance of elevations. Some of them had separate committees or even external managers for the job.Many also prefer to go for an annual maintenance contract (AMC) with the company that instals the elevator in the apartment. Shilpa T, an MNC employee residing in Seegehalli informs that her complex with four apartments is fitted with Aero-LIFT elevators. “The Aero-LIFT company itself has been handed the responsibility of maintaining the elevators,” she says.But not all apartments score high on lift safety. Kishor Kumar P, secretary of the Bank Officers’ Cooperative Housing Society, Aicoboonagar, draws attention to flat owners who opt for smaller, local, and possibly lower quality companies for elevator maintenance. “Most of them naturally do it to economise on the construction cost, even if the elevators had been initially installed by a much better known and higher quality company,” he elaborates.A representative of a leading elevator manufacturer in the country concurs: “An AMC with the supplying company can be considered ideal but sometimes, builders go for cheaper options. The maintenance work is handed over to smaller, local companies,” he says.“There are many safety parameters that need to be met during installation and maintenance of elevators. While no company in Bengaluru forgoes such parameters, we cannot say so for certain when it comes to maintenance by local brands. They might bypass some of these parameters to do the job at a lesser expenditure,” explains the representative. “There is every chance that this would prove dangerous.”Use of the right kind of cables and switches is necessary, depending upon the elevator of the building, says the representative. “One can still see smaller companies using slightly lower quality cables but the front-runners in installation of elevators always insist on using armoured cables,” he explains.A few apartments go beyond the mandated rules to doubly secure lift safety. For instance, additional safety measures were taken at Krishna Prakash apartments, where the elevators were provided alarms and cameras, informs Kishor Kumar. Karthik, who works at Rockline Centre, Trinity Circle, recalls how the elevators were shut down during floods to prevent damage and electrical mishaps.Builders and management also need to ensure the elevators are user-friendly for all users. Shilpa recalls that the elevators at her apartment in Seegehalli had got stuck in between floors. “The sensors did not work for some time and we were forced to change the elevator usage plan. Housekeeping work too sometimes affects the working of the elevators as daily waste is piled up near the lift entrance,” she adds.Senior citizens and the physically challenged have to struggle to use elevators that are poorly installed or do not meet certain requirements. While the door of an elevator has to be more than 700 mm wide to fit in a wheelchair, many builders are seen compromising on the width due to space shortage.When an elevator gives room only to stand, use of such an elevator proves a problem to the physically challenged, even if they are not wheelchair-bound.But there are others who hesitate getting into a lift out of fear of a fall or a bit of nausea as the lift ‘takes off’. Fitness freak Shankar gives another perspective, “A lift is the comparatively more preferred means of transport as against the ‘safer’ and ‘healthier’ stairs. This is so even for many who are fit enough to walk up a couple of floors.”	Elevators,	 Nov 25 2018
City headed for severe water crisis, says DyCM	"Bengaluru is headed for severe drinking water crises in the near future.Speaking at the Janaspandana, a civic grievance redressal event organised by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, Parameshwara said there is no further plans to assure water supply to the constantly expanding city beyond the fifth stage of the Cauvery Water Supply Scheme.""The city is growing rapidly and may face water crises in the future,"" Parameshwara, also the Bengaluru Development Minister said. ""We have to find a solution soon. People should start saving water to solve future crises,"" he added.The Cauvery Water Supply Scheme aims to build a comprehensive water and sewerage network to treat 775 mld of raw Cauvery water at a new plant, to be set up in Thorekadanahalli and pumped to the Harohalli and Tataguni pumping stations. From there, water would be supplied to the city.Water supply will be split to the west and east side. It would include the 110 villages added to the BBMP limits in 2007.""I am conducting a meeting with the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board officials to work out a solution for the water scarcity,"" Parameshwara said. ""Under the Yettinahole drinking water project, Bengaluru will get only 2.5 TMC of water. We will, therefore, take up the project, worth Rs 280 crore, to revive the Thippagondanahalli reservoir and ensure supply to the city soon,"" he said."	G Parameshwara,	 Nov 24 2018
LED lamps to replace sodium vapor streetlights in 2 yrs	all sodium vapour street lamps to LED lights in the next two years to save about 80% of energy. A dedicated control room will also be set up to monitor the functioning of street lights. Addressing the Janaspandana programme, a civic grievance redressal event organised by the BBMP, Palike commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said, “Since we are receiving several complaints from the residents about dysfunctional of street lights, the BBMP will convert five lakh sodium vapour street lamps with LED bulbs. The decision will be taken at the upcoming Cabinet meeting.”The civic body is now paying an electricity bill of Rs 20 crore annually and about Rs 50 crore a year for maintaining street lights. “After installing LED lights, the centralised control room will track the condition of streetlights. If any LED light is fused, the control room personnel will alert the ground staff to repair it immediately,” he added.Prasad assured citizens that there will be no streetlight complaints when this project is completed in two years.Hard to get RTI replyTo address grievances of residents of east Bengaluru, BBMP organised Janaspandana.Garbage crisis, traffic congestion, commercialisation of residential areas, water scarcity were some of the problems the residents highlighted.Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara, Mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun and officials heard the grievances at Town Hall.Srinivas, a resident, complained that officials were not providing RTI replies. “I applied for RTI seeking information one-and-a-half years ago. I have not received any reply so far,” he said.The BBMP commissioner replied, “We will review the complaint and take necessary action if RTI is not replied by officials.”Another resident complained that officials were not available in the offices to solve their grievances.

Seized vehicles clog sidewalks in Jeevan Bima Nagar	and the traffic police station which is right across the road, are crammed with seized vehicles, causing deep distress to the pedestrians.Either side of the road are now stuffed with vehicles seized for violating norms. The situation has turned into a nightmare for pedestrians, as they are deprived of sidewalks on the Jeevan Bima Nagar main road. Ironically, the scenario seems to be the new normal for sidewalks near many traffic police stations in the city. Many seized vehicles have become a regular fixture in the vicinity of a traffic police station.When DH visited Jeevan Bima Nagar, more than a dozen trashed cars were found abandoned on the sidewalk, stretching for almost 500 meters on either direction from the respective stations towards the immediate traffic signal.Another road adjacent to the traffic police station which leads to various residential neighbourhoods in Jeevan Bima Nagar has footpaths clogged with vehicles -- predominantly two-wheelers.Pedestrians feel the traffic police are violating their space. “The footpaths have been in a similar state for more than seven years now,” a regular commuter told DH.The issue is also a major safety concern. “We have to literally stand on the main road to wait for vehicles to clear. If there was a footpath, it would have been safer and easier,” said Navya Kumari, a resident. According to the sub-inspector, traffic, Jeevan Bima Nagar, the residents understand the situation. “They know we do not have any empty space granted specially to park the seized vehicles. We are forced to park vehicles on footpaths,” he said. “We do understand the problem the pedestrians are facing, but we are also helpless. The government should sanction us some empty space around or close by to the station,” he added.	Bengaluru,Jeevan Bima Nagar,traffic,	 Nov 24 2018

India first: KIA's automated 'self bag drop' system	to complete your baggage check-in at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). The Bengaluru airport on Thursday became the first in India to introduce a fully automated 'self-bag drop' system.For now, the facility will be available only for passengers of Air Asia and SpiceJet. KIA operator Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) has deployed 16 fully-automated Self Bag Drop machines. This, says BIAL, will significantly accelerate the baggage transaction and reduce check-in queues.Designed and installed by Materna IPS, the facility will be expanded to more airlines in the near future.How it works:The Self Bag Drop employs a two-step approach. A passenger will first print a boarding pass and an eezee-tag (bag tag) at a self-check-in kiosk. Once tagged, the passenger will go to the bag drop machine, scan the boarding pass to initiate the bag drop process. The bag will be measured, weighed, scanned and automatically fed into the baggage handling system.A total of 32 new self-check-in kiosks will be installed to print boarding pass and baggage tags. “These kiosks have been specially designed for the Bengaluru Airport. In the case of excess baggage, the passenger will be directed to a hybrid counter to complete the check-in and payment,” informs a BIAL spokesperson.However, the spokesperson adds, multiple payment gateway options for excess baggage will be integrated into the machines at a later stage as part of the technology enhancement.Besides reducing waiting time, the automated system is expected to help airlines cut their staff strength in the long run. Currently, at least two personnel are deployed by the airlines to complete the check-in system. At the airline counter, an assistant issues the boarding pass once the ticket is verified, while another tag the baggage to be checked in.The new technology will change this system. “India’s airports are being confronted with growth of up to 25% right now and have expansion plans to match. However, they have to make the best possible use of their existing infrastructure as extensions and new buildings take too long. The self-service project at KIA is the first of its kind in India, says Shibu Mathews, head of Materna in India.	Kempegowda International Airport,	 Nov 15 2018
Govt fails to regulate private bus fares	government has failed to keep its promise of curbing private bus operators from charging exorbitant fares during rush days.Private buses make hay during long weekends and holidays, when railways and state transport buses cannot keep up to the commuters demands, by charging twice or thrice the fares on popular routes.In the run-up to Deepavali, private bus fares went up by more than 100% on longer routes, especially those bound to Hubballi, Belagavi, Hyderabad and Mangaluru. Sleeper bus fares to Hubballi went up to Rs 2,200, against the regular fare of Rs 800.On November 2, 3 and 5, Regional Transport Department officials booked 1517 private bus operators across the state, including 946 in Bengaluru. Officials said the cases were based on a violation of the contract carriage permit conditions. However, the issue of exorbitant fares during the long weekend and festive rush has remained unresolved.Additional Transport Commissioner C P Narayanaswamy said there were two major violations of the permit, including carrying of parcel luggage and picking up passengers from places between the origin and destination.“About Rs 15 lakh pending taxes and Rs 1.5 lakh of compounding fee was collected. Additionally, we have seized 17 buses, against whom tax of Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh was pending. Some of these buses did not have a fitness certificate. Fine was also imposed on several buses for various violations,” he said.Asked whether cases were booked specifically for high fares, Narayanaswamy said action can be taken against such practices only if the government approves such a rule. “We have taken statements from passengers in these buses for clear proof for exorbitant fares. Some were paying Rs 1,600 for a ticket that cost not more than Rs 700 earlier. But we can’t file cases till the government approves a proposal for fare fixation,” he said.Sources in the Transport Department said a proposal for fixing minimum and maximum fares for such buses was pending with the government for several months. “Fixing fares will also help bring down other violations. The decision has to be taken at a government level,” the source said.	private bus,	 Nov 07 2018
BBMP invites bids multi-level car park, Kidwai hospital	"set to get relief from parking problems. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has invited bids for building another multi-level parking complex at the hospital. The three-storey complex will cost Rs 14 crore to build and will accommodate 150 cars and 100 two-wheelers. The project was sanctioned in the BBMP's 2017-18 budget. M K Gunashekar, the then chairman of the BBMP's standing committee on tax and finance, had inspected the hospital and felt it needed adequate parking space. Speaking to DH, Gunashekar said his visit had followed a request from the hospital's director to find a solution to the parking problem. Established in 1973, Kidwai is the premier state-run cancer hospital in Karnataka and sees thousands of patients and their attendants every day. The parking complex will replace an old structure which is located behind the main building but is within the hospital's larger compound, a BBMP official said. According to Kidwai director C Ramachandra, the hospital sees at least 1,000 vehicles every day. Some outpatients and their relatives also drive in. ""But there is no parking space. The multi-level car park will help both patients and the hospital staff,"" he told this newspaper. Freedom Park car park The multi-level parking complex at the Freedom Park in the heart of Bengaluru will not open by December as the work is far from over. The project began in 2015 and has already missed three deadlines. The Rs 79-crore complex, which would accommodate 500 cars and as many two-wheelers, will open only in March 2019.

2,965 vehicles caught dumping garbage	Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to initiate criminal action against those who throw garbage in places cleaned by pourakarmikas, the BBMP marshalls have caught 2,965 vehicles for dumping garbage in the eight zones in the last seven days.The BBMP zone joint commissioner will file cases in the police station soon. Speaking to DH, BBMP Additional Commissioner (Health) D Randeep said, “The court has directed the BBMP to catch the vehicles involved in the illegal dumping of garbage on the black spot and file criminal case in the local police stations. The case will also be filed against the owners of the vehicles with the help of vehicle registration numbers.”According to the available data, the civic body marshalls have caught 1,023 two-wheelers, 128 three wheelers, 71 light motor vehicles, 22 trucks and 33 tractors between November 1 to 7.As per the High Court direction to bring down the number of black spots, the BBMP had beautified the black spots by drawing rangolis during Kannada Rajyotsava with an aim to clear at least five black spots in each ward.	garbage dumping,	 Nov 07 2018
Geotag toilets: BBMP dither over creating awareness	"All you need to do is to type the word 'toilet' in Google Maps, which would direct you to the nearest place to ease yourself.While the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike made efforts to geotag public toilets, it did very little to create awareness about the initiative. That meant many city dwellers are largely in the dark about the facility.In September, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MoHUA) teamed up with tech giant Google to launch the #LooReview campaign to geotag public toilets in all urban local bodies in the country.One of the main objectives of the #LooReview campaign was to make people aware how accessible public toilets are in urban areas. Besides locating them in Google Maps, the option to review them also help their maintenance.In reality, however, the BBMP is yet to begin a social media campaign to bring the spotlight on the mapping of the toilets.Sapna Karim, who heads civic participation in Janaagraha, says the reluctance to publicise toilet mapping could be because their numbers are still minimal.""The BBMP is still falling behind the number of toilets to meet the Swachh Bharat targets. Another reason why it hasn't publicised the toilet availability is their poor maintenance. Many of them don't have a functioning flush and adequate lighting, among other things,"" Sapna said.A recent survey by Jaanagraha revealed that the city has more toilets in the inner wards and few in the periphery. It is also falling behind the 1,100 toilets fixed on the basis of the population figures.Randeep D, BBMP's special commissioner for solid waste management, said the civic body would launch the awareness drive since it has already geotagged the toilets. ""We'll start the awareness campaign sometime next week,"" he added.The campaign is one of the key factors for the city to get better rankings in the Swachh Survekshan survey. Lack of awareness about public toilets cost the city crucial points and made it slide down the rankings last time around. We have to keep our fingers crossed to know how it fairs this year."

Private buses create traffic chaos on Tumakuru Road	private buses, restricted to the flyover, returning to the road.The buses have a contract carriage permit that prohibits them from picking up passengers between the origin and destination points. But most of the 1,500 buses stop at several locations within the city limits and this leads to traffic jams.Since Tumakuru Road is the major entry and exit point between Bengaluru and the northern parts of the state, the traffic police had imposed restrictions to end the menace created by contract carriage buses.Last year, City Police Commissioner T Suneel Kumar issued rules for such buses. “Private contract carriage buses are barred from operating at Peenya, Jalahalli Cross and 8th Mile. They have to mandatorily ply on the flyover from Goraguntepalya,” he said, while making an exception for the buses entering Bengaluru.The order was passed on March 26 under Section 116 of the Central Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. However, its validity was limited to a month unless published in the state gazette.“The order never appeared in the gazette. We checked with officials in the section concerned and they said they never received it,” said a source in the transport department.The buses, earlier banned on the grade-level road, gradually started picking passengers from the service road and the main road below the flyover, the traffic police said.“We know contract carriage buses stop along the road to pick passengers. The artificial traffic jams they create are a regular headache. But stopping them is the job of RTO officials,” a policeman said.Officials from the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) were the first to complain to the police.“This was the same time when we were planning to shift a majority of services from the Kempegowda bus station in Majestic to the Peenya satellite station. As private buses avoided the flyover, we knew they would illegally pick up half the passengers who would have taken public transport,” a senior official said.	Tumakuru Road,traffic,	 Nov 05 2018
BBMP issues khata for CA site, sanctions building plan	to protect a Civic Amenity (CA) site, despite the Anti-Corruption Bureau’s (ACB) preliminary inquiry proving that BBMP officials illegally issued a khata and plan sanction for it. The CA site is in Amara Jyoti House Building Co-operative Society in Domlur.Based on a request by the Society, Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) had notified certain lands for acquisition, including 4.05 acres of land in survey numbers 68/1 and 68/2. The compensation for it was also disbursed. In the BDA-approved layout plan, an extent of 18 guntas of land in survey number 68/2 was earmarked and shown as CA site for park and road.A complaint filed by a Domlur resident, B Shivashankar, stated that a developer, Sunil Gupta has begun construction at the site after obtaining a khata and building plan. Shivashankar alleged that the developer made a representation before the BBMP authorities seeking khata and plan sanction for construction of a commercial building by falsely stating that the extent of 18 guntas of land, which is in fact in survey number 68/2, is in survey number 68/1.Documents reveal that based on a request by the original owner of the land in survey number 68/1, the state government had dropped 1.12 acres of land from acquisition.However, in 1996, special land acquisition officer (SLAO) again acquired 38 guntas of land in survey number 68/1. Subsequently, in 2005 Guramma filed an application seeking khata in her name for the 24 guntas of land in survey number 68/1. When the BBMP sought an opinion, the SLAO in a letter reiterated that the land was part of the acquisition and handed over to the society.“The BBMP revenue officials on the pretext of seeking a second opinion created a fake note from SLAO saying the land was not part of the acquisition. Based on this letter, the BBMP officials, concealing the fact that the said land falls in survey number 68/2, cleared the sketch and spot inspection and issued a khata in favour of Guramma in 2006,’’ an official said.Before the khata was issued, Guramma had executed a sale agreement for the land with Sunil Gupta’s wife for a consideration of Rs 5.22 crore. Subsequently, the property was sold between Sunil Gupta and his wife in 2007. Acting on the complaint by Shivashankar, the BBMP has asked the developer not to continue the construction work and also to produce documents for an inquiry. BBMP Joint Commissioner and DC (east) were not available for a comment.	BBMP,BDA,	 Nov 03 2018
Garbage black spot cleared on Kanakapura Road	in Bengaluru South division has collected about Rs 5000 with the help of marshals and night guards keeping vigil and preventing people from dumping garbage on a probable lake bed on Kanakapura Main Road.Located opposite H M Tambourine, an apartment complex, the spot was a major headache for residents for many years as garbage was regularly dumped there. After several attempts to clean up a patch of the lake bed, the residents collected funds up to Rs 1.25 lakh and erected barricades and painted the area to prevent the dumping of waste.On October 28 the residents invited an NGO- 'Way for Life' to help them barricade the place and paint along with some music and songs. The patch of land where people used to cover their nose and walk was freed of the bad odour since Sunday.Aleem, a resident of the apartment complex, said that the credit must go to the BBMP staff who are helping in keeping the place clean. “It is not easy to keep vigil at night only to prevent people from dumping garbage. Besides guarding the place, the BBMP health inspector has also fined many persons who dump the garbage,” he added.Mahesh, the health inspector, said that he has taken up the task of cleaning the place and preventing all probable black spots in his area of work. “We have fined many educated people who come in the night to dump garbage, I have not spared anyone and ensured the fine amount is collected. I have also asked many of these defaulters to send their photo the next day when they are handing over their garbage to our vehicle,” he added.	BBMP,Garbage crisis,	 Nov 03 2018
Varthur Lake to get marshalls soon	garbage dumping and encroachments.The Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA) commissioner had written to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) requesting it to deploy marshalls at the Varthur Lake similar to the Bellandur Lake.“As an extension of the initiative taken up by you for the Bellandur Lake, I request you to deploy marshals for the Varthur Lake also in the interest of the waterbody,” his letter written on October 27 said.Speaking to DH, Rakesh Singh, BDA Commissioner, said “I had a word with the BBMP commissioner about deploying the marshalls at the Varthur Lake. This may take a few days. The BBMP is very positive about deploying the marshalls.”In March 2018, the civic body had deputed retired army men as lake marshals at the Bellandur Lake. Around 24 marshals are keeping an eye round-the-clock in three shifts. The civic body pays them an honorarium also. They patrol the 960-acre lake, covering 27 km, every day.Meanwhile, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said: “BDA has asked for marshalls at the Varthur Lake similar to the Bellandur Lake. I have already instructed the officials to make arrangement to deploy the ex-servicemen.”“In a week, we will have about 10 marshalls working there in three shifts with Prahari vehicles” he added.The Varthur Lake is the second largest waterbody spread across 445-acre and is also one of the most polluted lakes in the city. The lake ecosystem is polluted because of sewage water and illegal dumping of garbage and debris.	garbage dumping,Varthur Lake,Bangalore Development Authority (BDA),Encroachments,	 Nov 03 2018
BDA: low water, but Bellandur Lake not drying up	up of Bellandur Lake, BDA officials inspected the waterbody and clarified the lakebed hadn’t dried up.The water level had reduced at some places in the past few days as sluice gates were opened and a lot of water had drained out of the lake, they claimed. “There has been a prolonged dry spell over the past few weeks as we had left the sluice gates open for some reasons. We have closed the sluice gates downstream. Now that the water has filled up till the waste weir level, we may not see dry patches in the lake bed,” said B A Shivananda, engineering officer, BDA.Residents alerted the BDA on October 28 shortly after finding some dry patches in the lakebed. “The lake may be encroached on if more of the lakebed shows up. BDA says the drying up is a result of sluice gates being left open for some days, but we are not aware of it,” said Sonali Singh, of Bellandur.Lake experts attributed the reduced water to the diversion of treated water to Kolar under the KC Valley project. “Huge amounts of silt is deposited on the lakebed and the lake cannot hold water now. The treated water being diverted to Kolar could be behind the reduced water level. Reduced sewage inflow to the lake is another reason,” said a lake expert, preferring anonymity.The BDA has submitted an action plan to the NGT about desilting Bellandur Lake, its commissioner Rakesh Singh said. But residents want desilting to start on one side of the lake soon so the lake doesn’t dry up.	Bellandur Lake,BDA,	 Nov 03 2018

We have thought of an alternative place to dump garbage near Terra Farm in Doddaballapur.""Parameshwara said Marenahalli, Bagalur and Ulahalli are also in consideration to dispose of the solid waste. ""We are planning to use modernised machinery here so that the localities don't face issues like stench,"" he added.BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad informed DH that the civic body has submitted details of the three places for the new quarry at the NGT meeting held recently.""They (NGT) are quite satisfied with our plan. We are also monitoring these places through drones,"" Prasad said.Parameshwara welcomed the high court's intervention in directing the BBMP to clear the black spots in the city. ""The city has close to 1.3 crore people and generates 5,700 tonnes of garbage every day. It is a huge task for the civic body to collect and dispose of garbage on a daily basis,"" he added.He said the government is considering both short- and long-term solutions for solid waste management. For now, the civic body has roped in NGOs, Residents' Welfare Associations (RWAs), besides engaging marshals, to clear the black spots, while it plans to set up a control room to monitor and resolve issues at the ward level.The BBMP is also planning to deploy one assistant executive engineer and a senior health officer to each Assembly constituency to look after solid waste management. ""So far, health officials were not looking after garbage-related issues and focused only on issuing trade licences. But now, we'll get additional hands,"" he added."

Neglected footpaths on Old Airport Road imperil seniors	her leg on her way to a medical shop near Manipal Hospitals on the Old Airport Road.She had to get her knee treated. “Not just me, a lot of senior citizens living here struggle to navigate that footpath. It’s busy but remains in bad condition,” she said.Seniors living in the vicinity of Old Airport Road concur with Saraswathi, describing traversing the two-kilometre footpath as a nightmare. Despite more than 10,000 pedestrians using the footpath every day, it remains in a dilapidated condition. The footpath has gaping holes in places where the slabs are missing, while the cement blocks along the way cause obstruction. Besides, vendors have set up shop and the optical fibre cables hang down from tree branches in some sections. Basavanna (62) who resides on Old Airport Road said it is nearly impossible to traverse the footpath in the night time. “I live alone with my wife and have to walk down the footpath to buy grocery and other things as my wife can’t walk. The footpath is damaged and is encroached at a few places,” he said.The condition of other footpaths in the HAL Airport ward in the BBMP’s Mahadevapura zone is no better. Residents lament that they remain in disrepair despite complaints to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).Palike officials, on the other hand, attributed their inability to repair the footpath to lack of funds.“We’d have repaired them by now if only we have got the funds,” a BBMP official said. BBMP chief engineer Parameshwariah told DH that the government provides Rs 2 to Rs 3 crore for each ward according to the ward budget. “I’ll direct HAL ward corporator to utilize the funds to repair the footpath,” he said.	footpath damage,potholes,Bengaluru,	 Nov 02 2018
Need ID cards immediately: marshals tell BBMP	"littering, have demanded that the BBMP issue identity cards at the earliest.Citing persistent demands to establish their identity, many are humiliated over handling issues on the ground. The former servicemen have warned they may not turn up for work, if their demand is not met immediately.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and the Bangalore Development Authority have deployed around 400 former servicemen, NCC and ACC cadets in Bellandur and Varthur lakes, abandoned quarries and solid waste management sites.In fact, the BBMP is now working to deploy two marshals in each of the city's 198 wards to wipe out the garbage black spots. In the past four days alone, the marshals have caught 100 vehicles dumping garbage during the night time.""We are asked to produce ID cards despite our uniforms and using the BBMP's prahari vehicles,"" said Col Basavaraj, a marshal. ""People don't take us seriously and ask what powers we have to stop them from littering and slapping fines. Surprisingly, such questions are raised by educated citizens.""Marshals carry an authorisation letter from the BBMP, stating that they have the powers to stop and penalise offenders. The situation has turned ugly sometimes and the marshals had to summon the police. ""So, the BBMP should issue ID cards to prove we work for the city authority,"" Col Basavaraj said.As a marshal, Wesley Fernandes had to tolerate abuse from those he stops and penalises for violation. ""We face embarrassments every day,"" he lamented. ""Vehicles disregard the orders to stop. Many such incidents (of clashes between marshals and polluters) happen around Bellandur, HSR Layout, Mahadevapura and surrounding areas.""BBMP commissioner Manjunath Prasad could not conceal his shock when DH explained the plight of the marshals.

Parameshwara lashes out over garbage crisis	complaints from citizens on the garbage mess, Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara hauled Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials over their cavalier attitude in addressing the worsening crisis across the city. Accompanied by the Mayor, the BBMP Commissioner and other senior officials, Parameshwara on Friday took stock of the situation in every zone. Patiently sitting through presentations spanning several hours, Parameshwara lost his cool when officials briefed him that engineers refuse to attend to the garbage problem. A senior official, who was part of the meeting, told DH that he lashed out at the senior officials for messing up the administration.“Transfer 13 assistant engineers from the planning section to manage garbage disposal with immediate effect. If they refuse to report for duty, repatriate them to their mother departments and we will get a few other engineers from other departments. We have already sent back 30 engineers to the PWD. Should we (state government) get rapped by the High Court because of your callous and shoddy work? What did we gain after having spent several crores on garbage? Can’t you all discharge your duties as desired?” Parameshwara reportedly chided the officials of the Solid Waste Management (SWM) section of BBMP.Failing to implement his previous instructions, an assistant executive engineer of South division (Yeshwantpur) also received flak. “The main road in Yeshwantpur is infested with bushes and weeds on either side. I had told the officer to clear the bushes and manage it properly. But to date, the situation has been the same. If you can not listen to what I say, why do we need officials like you,” Parameshwara reportedly said to the official. Revealing that the recent audit of the SWM wing in BBMP had revealed several discrepancies Parameshwara reportedly said, “There has been a huge mismatch between the number of workers shown on the list and the actual number of workers working at the ward level. Besides, regular autos and tippers have also been added to the list as garbage vehicles which do not exist in reality. We will soon order a CID inquiry into these irregularities and culprits will be dealt with severely.”	Garbage crisis,G Parameshwara,BBMP,	 Nov 02 2018
Discrepancy on pothole reports by BBMP and Commission	that it has posted all the details about the pothole filling work done so far on their website. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari was hearing a petition on the potholes in the city. However, the court commission submitted that their inspection of the ongoing work by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike (BBMP) painted a different picture on the quality of work. It said that the current work in some areas is as per the technical specifications. The court commission's report on pothole inspection is below: The court orally observed that the court commission has to intervene for the BBMP to do its job. It further stated that an engineer from another branch has to tell BBMP engineers on basic specifications with regard to filling the potholes. The court added that Bengaluru must have motorable roads. The bench further stated that traffic in the city has expanded beyond the capacity of the roads and the alternative looks like another road but that also has to be motorable.The BBMP also submitted that they will work together with BWSSB to address the issue of potholes. The court then asked the BBMP to inform the court commission as to which areas it will undertake the filling of potholes from Saturday to November 2. The court also asked BBMP to file a progress report on the work done with regard to SWDs from Saturday till November 2.HC to hear petitions on Bengaluru civic infrastructure on SaturdaysThe Karnataka High Court plans to dedicate Saturdays to hear petitions seeking to address issues on civic infrastructure. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari will hear petitions regarding pressing issues concerning the cleaning and maintenance of stormwater drains, removal of flexes and hoardings and potholes on Saturdays.The decision came after the bench observed that these petitions need a detailed hearing and hearing them on weekdays is taking a toll on the hearing of other petitions.The poor state of garbage cleaning in the city by BBMP was also cited in the commission's report. The court orally asked the BBMP Commissioner to ensure that the city is garbage-free by October 31.	Karnataka High Court,potholes,BBMP,	 Oct 27 2018
BBMP’s failure to fill all potholes riles HC	for its failure to fill all potholes in the city by October 23 and rejected the civic body’s claim of considerable progress. A division bench led by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, hearing a PIL petition on potholes, noted that the BBMP’s incompetence was affecting the court’s functioning as other matters were held up. The deadline was set by the court at the last hearing. The court got to know the BBMP didn’t meet the deadline when the petitioner identified at least 43 potholes. Clearly disappointed, the court said it had expected the BBMP to submit that the city was free of potholes. The court rejected the BBMP counsel’s submission that the civic body was still filling potholes and that there had been considerable progress. The bench ordered the BBMP to fill the 43 potholes by 1.30 pm.The civic body later informed the court that it had filled only 14 of them and that 24 were in areas where the BBMP had dug up roads. “If the BBMP cannot do it, some other agency will do it and this will come through an order after announcing BBMP as a failure and it will come with a heavy price,” the court said. Observing that the civic body had proved its incompetence, the court further orally said: “If BBMP does not work, it does not mean the city will shut down. It only means BBMP will shut down.” Inspection tomorrowThe court directed the two-member commission it had appointed earlier to inspect the areas where the BBMP was filling potholes and submit a report on Thursday. It asked the BBMP to cooperate in the inspection. The court noted that the pothole case was affecting the adjudication of other matters. It said it would hear the pothole case on Saturdays and orally observed that the BBMP commissioner must pay the allowance of court officers on such days. The court asked senior counsel Aditya Sondhi to request the coordination committee headed by the chief secretary to take the pothole issue on priority.	BBMP,Karnataka High Court,Pothole,	 Oct 23 2018
Poor lift facility: REVA students delay for class	to their classes on time. Having eight floors, the university campus has only two lifts for thousands of students.Students feel the management is deliberately negligent towards their grievance for many years, forcing them to take the steps to reach the classrooms on time.A student requesting anonymity told DH, “We are crammed inside the lift. The lifts can accommodate a maximum of 20 people at a time, but they take in more than 25, putting our lives at risk. We don’t have any other option. There is also a separate time for us to use lift. Even if someone is severely ill or injured we are not allowed to take the lift until we submit a medical certificate. Sometimes we fall sick while in college. It gets difficult for female students during their periods. We have approached the authorities many times, but nothing has changed.”Students also alleged that the two lifts directly go to the eighth floor from the first floor, forcing students to take the steps from the first floor or to get down from the eight floor.“Does it make any sense to travel all the way eight floors and then get down to the fifth floor. We have also requested to implement the plans in a better way, but all the new rules or changes are making our lives miserable every day,” added another student.However, when the management of REVA university was asked about the row, they denied the students’ allegations by saying that the lift is catering to all the floors.“It is impossible to overload the lifts. If we overload them, the doors will not close. We have a time frame to use the lifts to make the students attend the assembly session before the class commences. Lots of students tend to miss it, so we have set a time limit to take the lift. “If students still have a problem they can always approach the management and we will look into the issue. We don’t compromise when it comes to students’ safety,” said Dr Ramesh, Dean, REVA University to DH.	lift,Reva University,students,	 Oct 12 2018
1,000 thambis of Madras Sappers clean Halasuru Lake	the Halasuru Lake in the heart of Bengaluru was no less than a battlefield on Wednesday morning.Entering the choppy waters barehanded, hundreds of Sappers from the Madras Engineering Group (MEG) of the Indian Army cleaned the water body on a war footing. Unable to withstand a beautiful lake dying right in front of their eyes, more than hundred Sappers (thambis) slogged for over eight hours since the dawn and cleansed the lake.By afternoon their collective effort resulted in the removal of more than a whopping 100 tonnes of water hyacinth, toxic weed and garbage.The Sappers had cleaned the lake in April-May this year and pulled out about 70 tonnes of weeds and garbage. However, this time the quantity of weeds and garbage has increased considerably. Sources at MEG revealed that the weeds and pollutants had flowed into the lake from the BBMP sediment tank.“Over the years, the lakes of Bangalore have deteriorated due to increasing sewage being drained into the lakes by the surging population. Moreover, the water hyacinth also keeps flowing into the lakes and choking their breathing life.“Ulsoor lake however has survived this calamity for the past several decades due to the incessant efforts put in by the Sappers of Madras Engineers Group and Centre. To tide over these problems, MEG has been repeatedly undertaking cleanliness drives in the lake regularly,” an official release from the Defence ministry stated.Halasuru Lake, located in the heart of Bengaluru, is a part of the daily life of Madras Sappers and is used daily for training purposes.

Residents strive to breathe life into Nallurahalli Lake	"once a favourite spot for migratory birds, has turned into a dumping yard for IT parks and residences in the area. All this, thanks to the BBMP's apathy.Garbage abounds the banks of the 24-acre lake, and the stormwater drain leading to the waterbody is choked with plastic.Apart from being encroached by private firms at a few places, the lake has turned into a dumping yard of vegetable and meat waste from several restaurants, IT parks and residential areas in the locality.Regular walkers across the lake complain about the foul smell emanating from the garbage mounds. ""I can spot worms feeding on the garbage and see dogs feasting on the rotten meat every day. Forget the smell, but we can’t bear the mosquito menace,"" said Vimal S, a resident in the vicinity. De-weeding of the lake was done by the residents, including apartment dwellers and village folks, two years ago. They had even planted over 300 saplings along the bund.""Two years ago, hardly any garbage was dumped here. But the intensity (of garbage dumping) has increased over the months. No civic body is heading this way. The residents and restaurants here fear no one. They will continue to dump waste until someone restricts them,"" Vimal added. Many corporate professionals are trying to clean parts of the lake as a part of their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) activities.""Last week, we visited the lake and planted some saplings, and cleared a bit of the dry plastic in the area.

Poor network throws a spanner in BNU's digital push	colleges are unhappy with the varsity’s demand to upload their details online. As most of the affiliated colleges are situated in rural areas, they are plagued with poor internet connectivity and a shortage of computers in the colleges. “This should be done by the colleges and the university. Instead, they are putting the burden on us. They are aware that rural students lack such facilities, yet they are insisting that we do it for ourselves. The internet connectivity is very poor and it takes at least half an hour to upload the details,” said a student of a college affiliated to BNU. The students are a worried lot because the last date to upload the details is October 10. They are forced to visit cybercafes in nearby towns, not only missing their classes but also paying a hefty sum. “The owners demand Rs 150–200 to upload each student’s details. It has become a huge burden for students from economically weak sections. Even colleges have a scarcity of computer systems and internet,” the student added.Dr T D Kemparaju, vice-chancellor, BNU, told DH, “This move was intended to have all the stakeholders collectively participate. There were instances, where the student would notice an error in the marks card after receiving it. Then he/she would have to run pillar to post to get it corrected. With the new process, the student can enter his/her accurate details and also get the acknowledgement for the same. It is easier to spot where things go wrong.” In the latest process, the students’ details will go through three levels. The first level is with the students, the second with the college and the third at the university. When asked about the time constraints, the VC said, “We are more likely to extend the deadline. Since this is for the benefit of the students we will take a decision accordingly.”	BNU,students,	 Oct 10 2018
Dug-up roads not repaired, Whitefield residents suffer	nightmare for commuters as it has not yet been repaired after being dug up for laying pipelines for Cauvery water supply in Hagadur ward.Nagondanahalli Road is the only access for heavy vehicles coming from Kadugodi and Hoskote to reach Sarjapur Road, as they are banned from passing through Varthur bridge. But the condition of the road is pathetic as it is yet to be relaid after being dug up a few months ago to lay pipelines for Cauvery water connection.“I drive through this route every day to my office in Whitefield. After the short spells of rains over the last few weeks, the road is nothing but a cesspool, with many potholes. It is also strewn with garbage here and there. The BBMP is delaying restoration work,” said Navya Murthy, a resident of Nagondanahalli.Corporator, S Uday Kumar said that it will take some time to restore the road as Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is laying out sewage pipelines on the road. “The BBMP had dug up the road to lay pipelines for Cauvery water connection a few months ago after which we had started to restore the road. But due to rains, we stopped the work. Now that BWSSB is doing the work, it will take a few more months to restore the road.”Similar situation The residents of Thubarahalli have been striving hard to get the attention of BBMP to fix the two-km stretch of Thubarahalli village road for a decade now. Despite several complaints to the BBMP, the road has no street lights, footpaths and drains. The first protest was staged in 2013 by the residents after which the Palike had promised to fix the damaged road in five years. But nothing has changed so far. “The road leads to the biggest IT corridors in Whitefield limits. There are plenty of schools in and around Thubarahalli. The condition of the road is deteriorating day by day due to rains,” said Bhaskar Rao, resident.However, BBMP officials said that road widening and restoration should have started by now but is delayed due to lack of funds.

Have BMTC officials taken bribe, wonders minister	"he suggested that BMTC officials may have received bribes because ""they are mounting pressure to purchase electric buses by signing an agreement with a company."" The previous government had floated tenders for the purchase of 80 electric buses for Bengaluru. ""A Hyderabad company had applied. This company has manufactured 80 buses. Now, officials are exerting pressure to buy these buses. Can you imagine asking officials if they've taken a bribe,"" he said while speaking to reporters. To sign an agreement with the company would mean losses for the government, Thammanna said. ""We'll have to provide manpower to the company. We will also have to hand over the Shanthinagar bus depot to the Hyderabad company. So, we will not enter into an agreement with the company,"" he clarified. ""The government is thinking of operating electric buses on its own."" He added that no final decision had been taken on hiking bus fares. ""The proposal to hike fares by 18% is with the chief minister. Only he can take a final call,"" Thammanna said."	BMTC bus,Bengaluru,Thammanna,	 Oct 09 2018
Online plea against commercial buildings in Bellandur	"Bellandur have started an online petition seeking a reduction of congestion and commercial construction in Bellandur.The petition addressed to Mahendra Jain, additional chief secretary to the state government, is garnering support on change.org. The petition states that about 2.5 lakh residents of Bellandur along with employees, work in offices in and around Bellandur.The petition states that the commute time and quality of life have become unbearable due to the increase in vehicles and air pollution in and around Bellandur. The petition also states that the 78-acre RMZ Ecoworld, a tech park, houses 75,000 people in 23 office towers and also comprises 50 retail and dining outlets which have added significantly to the traffic mess on the road that connects Bellandur's residential community to the city via the outer ring road.The petition adds that the single arterial 40-feet-wide road cannot take the current load of vehicular traffic each day. It adds that this intersection that feeds into the EcoSpace junction on the ORR, has become notorious for nightmarish traffic congestion that blocks the entire ORR for miles.The petition also highlights that the additional 22-acre plot beside the residential community will soon have commercial set-ups after being taken over by RMZ. This additional planned commercial construction will add to the traffic woes. The petition adds that residents are already suffering from the adverse effects of air pollution caused by heavy traffic with many residents and children needing special medication and breathing aids.The residents, through the petition, have requested authorities to put a stop to this ""monstrous mess"" and stop these current projects and repurpose the use of this land in a planned and sustainable manner. They have also requested the additional joint secretary to hold meetings with RWAs and implement existing laws on congestion, carrying capacity and the need to cap new construction in areas where traffic is slow."

Breeze through KIA with Smart Security Lane	"breeze through a Smart Security Lane with Automated Tray Retrieval System (ATRS), dramatically reducing wait time at the security checkpoints. Once this is introduced, men and women will no longer need to be security-screened at different locations, a first in India. The KIA's operator, Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), has struck a deal with L3 Macdonald Humfrey (Automation) India Pvt Ltd, a UK-headquartered tech developer, to introduce the smart system. This agreement comes after a successful trial run in early 2017. The first phase will begin by the year-end, and the entire system will be in place by March 2019. The BIAL's decision to do away with gender-based segregation means families can stay together and will be screened together. ""This new system will accelerate the process of human and carry-on luggage screening faster than the regular methods, thereby reducing waiting time and congestion, offering an easy and efficient travel experience for passengers,"" the BIAL said in a release.The other benefits listed by the BIAL are reduced queuing and stress, accelerated passenger throughput, a significant reduction in manual intervention and cutting down of major capital and operational costs. Once fully operational, the passenger screening capacity will increase by over 50%. ""The smart lanes with ATRS will automatically return empty trays to the preparation area for passengers to place their bags and belongings, ending the hassle of looking for trays and also prevent empty trays from piling up."" Besides, the automated rollers will enable trays to automatically move into the screening machine, without the need for passengers or staff to push their trays/ bags into the X-Ray machines. ""We can now process more passengers in a secure and controlled environment, improving overall operational efficiency and enhancing safety and security,"" said the BIAL's Chief Operating Officer, Javed Malik. The first automated lanes will be installed in the domestic and international checkpoints by the end of 2018. ""The existing manual lanes will be replaced in a phased manner to ensure minimal disruption to airport operations. The project is due for completion by March 2019."" Mick Macdonald, president, Macdonald Humfrey (Automation) Ltd, said: ""Having installed similar solutions in many European, West Asian, North American and SEA airports, L3 Macdonald Humfrey has the expertise to implement this project at the Bengaluru airport."" How does it work? • Security screening officers will sit inside a secure central control room, fitted with a central screening system (Mach-Smart View Matrix System). • They will remotely process the images from the Smart Security Lanes.• Smart Lanes have 4/5 parallel divest stations where multiple passengers can get ready to be screened simultaneously.• All trays can carry the maximum-allowed cabin-size baggage. Trays are RFID-tagged and tracked from start to end. • Once passengers enter through the lanes, the trays will branch out into two lanes: One for security-cleared trays, easily accessed by passengers for a quick repack of their belongings. • The second lane is for trays with 'rejected' baggage that has an item that the security staff will query about. • Photo image and X-ray images of the tray are analysed. Possible threat items are marked on the touch screen by a screener in a remote screening room. The same images are available to the physical search officer to easily identify and remove items if required."	Kempegowda International Airport,Bengaluru,Airport,	 Oct 08 2018
Savior app to provide medical emergency needs	set to be launched in the city shortly. With just one click, the unique app alerts hospital ambulances, seeks help from trained first responders and informs the emergency contact registered in the app.Dikshith Rai, Founder and CEO of “Savior”, said the app will inform trained volunteers who can save a life within the golden hour.“About 460 people have been trained for the basic first aid required in case of an emergency.

He said that the ambulance response has improved by 85% in most part of Mangaluru,” he said. The volunteers are trained for basic life support, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), emergency accident care which includes stabilising an accident victim, stemming blood flow, splitting technics and proper transportation of the trauma victims. Volunteers are also trained for cases of choking, burns, scars, bites, stings etc.You can download the app and request to be a volunteer using the menu option.Once we train these people, we activate the volunteer mode. First responders (Volunteers) will only receive these emergency notifications when you keep the volunteer mode on.	Savior app,ambulance,	 Oct 08 2018
BBMP plans to shrink Gottigere Lake for road widening	spaces, government agencies have decided to cut a part of the Gottigere Lake on Bannerghatta Road for the Namma Metro project.At a recent meeting held by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Paike (BBMP) and the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), it was decided to widen the Bannerghatta Road by 10-15 feet. The road runs on the boundary of the 37.13-acre Gottigere Lake, which will pay the price for the development project.T Jagannath Rao, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Lakes, BBMP, told DH that at the meeting, it was decided to widen the Bannerghatta Road, including the Gottigere side, and give way for Metro Rail. A part of the lake will be lost in the process.Rao said there are no plans for any bridge. A concrete wall will be constructed on the dried-up portion of the lake. That portion will be made viable for road works.Another official, seeking anonymity, said it was easier to shrink lakes after the abolition of the Karnataka Lake Conservation of Develoment Authority (KLCDA) as the KLCDA Act is also lost. The lake can be saved only if the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) and the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) intervene.Interestingly, the Lokayukta had held a meeting with the BBMP officials to discuss issues pertaining to lakes on Friday. The Gottigere Lake issue was also discussed and the Lakayukta’s response was negative.During the visit of Upalokayukta Justice S B Majage in March 2015, directions were issued to fence and protect the lake.Locals and experts are not convinced with the idea of shrinking the lake. “A part of the lake has already been lost for toll road, layout and commercial establishments. The lake was once home to migratory birds and needs to be restored. With new projects, more area will be lost,” said Harsha, a resident.Prof T V Ramachandra, Energy and Wetlands Research Group, IISc, said the lake was being destroyed. He pointed out that according to the Wetlands Act 2015 and Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules 2016, the physical and chemical integrity of lakes cannot be altered. The size of the lake cannot be reduced, roads and bridges cannot be built over them, he noted.In 1999, environmentalist Suresh Heblikar had filed a petition in the Karnataka High Court against the BDA’s (the then custodian) move to construct a road through the lake. The court ordered that no road be laid on the lake and that water body should be maintained.Heblikar said the lake has lost its original identity. Now, if it is shrunk further, there nothing much would be left.	Namma Metro,Gottigere Lake,Bengaluru,BBMP,	 Oct 08 2018
Plan to unclog Majestic fails;  KSRTC buses back	buses to Peenya to decongest Majestic has turned out to be a sham with illegal operations by private buses forcing them back. Following a meeting between the heads of different departments last year, it was decided to utilise the Basaveshwara Bus Station in Peenya to decongest the Kempegowda Bus Station at Majestic. On April 12, the KSRTC shifted 60 buses bound for almost all the districts situated in the north of Bengaluru. “The shifting of 60 buses has caused operational loss of Rs 3 lakh per day as most of our passengers shifted to private buses. The losses almost doubled during the weekends and holiday periods,” a senior KSRTC official said. The services were restarted from Majestic on September 10. In the five months, the corporation is estimated to have suffered a loss of about Rs 6 crore. A senior official said they had advised against moving to Peenya until the government bans private buses from operating near Majestic. Operating buses from the satellite bus station in Peenya had proved to be suicidal for the KSRTC back in 2014 as well when the shifting of about 650 buses had led to losses to the tune of Rs 12 crore within two months. The Peenya bus station is situated 850 metres away from the main road while private buses would pick up passengers from Tumakuru Road. This time, despite pressure from the government, the KSRTC was cautious and shifted only 60 buses.“Senior officials in the government assumed that people would eventually start to board buses from Peenya. Even the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) tried to help by introducing 115 trips to the bus station every day. But nothing changed,” another official said. Initially, the KSRTC had claimed that the move to Peenya had helped them save fuel and time. “What is the use of saving fuel when all our passengers are boarding private buses?” the official said. Officials said they would write to the government to ensure restriction on the operation of private buses. “There is no point talking about decongestion if they don’t restrict private players,” the official said.

BDA writes to BBMP to control flooding in Bellandur	Bellandur, Varthur and Yamalur lakes, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) has now passed the buck on to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).In a letter to BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, BDA commissioner Rakesh Singh has pointed to the delay in commissioning the flood protection works at the three lakes.In the letter, Singh has warned BBMP of the beating they could receive from the NGT during the next hearings. “It would be relevant to bring to your notice the undesirable further impact of non-completion of works by BBMP if the rains continue further. We may end up receiving a notice from the NGT in this regard and BDA will find it difficult to defend the case and hence the request to complete the BBMP works on a war footing,” Singh said in the letter, a copy of which is with DH.BDA has stated that while the authority has complied with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines of controlling floods by creating sluice gates, BBMP is carrying out flood protection works by remodelling the valleys at Bellandur and Yamalur. The inordinate delay in commissioning the works has affected the lake, thus leading to frothing.Singh in the letter also said that while BDA has completed the construction of the sluice gate at Bellandur and is completing it at Yamalur, delay in executing the works by BBMP has led to blocking the flood water at Yamalur weir. This delay has led to the diversion of flood water to Bellalndur weir, which is causing the problem.Singh requested BBMP to complete the works without any further delay and temporary barriers constructed across Yamalur be removed immediately.Reacting to this, BBMP chief engineer Prahallad said that works are going on at Kalkere and Bellandur and will be completed soon. It was only recently that the BDA handed over the lake work to BBMP and they (BDA) cannot expect the works to be completed in a short span when the custodians have been unable to maintain the lake for so many years.

Citizens seek answers from authorities	plastic ban rule came in 2016. The BBMP must ensure a blanket ban on all kinds of plastic and not allow so called bio-degradable plastic bags... we do not have the authority to visit shops and implement the rule, so we need assistance.BBMP commissioner We are in the process of having junior health inspectors, to be empowered with hand-held machines, and fine those using plastic bags. They will be deputed shortly.Vikram Narayan, member of Indiranagar residents’ welfare association Illegal commercial establishments, including software companies, are coming up in residential areas in Indiranagar, causing huge concerns for local residents. Will the BBMP take any action against them? Deputy Chief MinisterI have seen many offices coming up in Indiranagar. It is probably because no one has complained and the officials concerned have not looked into the issue. We will look into it shortly. Dr Asha Benakappa, retired HoD, Vani Vilas HospitalThere is a new generation super-absorbent pampers used by infants, and on an average, each child is generating at least 15 kg to 20 kg garbage per month. How are we going to address this issue?Wilma RodriguesThis is one issue that needs to be addressed, and needs a permanent solution. Chandrashekhar, RWA member Just like how the BBMP constructed Indira Canteens in each ward, why can’t you come up with segregation and compost plants in each of the 198 wards?BBMP commissionerWe can come up with composting plants, but the citizens themselves oppose such plants. Why can’t members of the residents’ welfare associations decide on the place where they want the plant? The BBMP is ready to install these plants. Ravi Gangigati, a resident of NagarabhaviIs it not possible for the police on night patrol duty to fine those who are throwing garbage on the streets?Deputy Chief MinisterAt the moment, there is a fine of Rs 100, which can be increased to Rs 500 and up to Rs 5,000. But again, I may receive complaints about even the fine amount being demanded or misused. We will come up with a solution for this problem. Vani Murthy, member of Solid Waste Management Round TableWe need to come up with a model to provide rebate on property tax for those who do home composting and reduce waste at least by 60%. We do not need 24-hour composting machines.BBMP commissionerThere is a proposal to provide 50% rebate and it has to be discussed before the council and approved. Anuradha Govind, Whitefield RisingOur apartment is located in a ward that has large areas and requires numerous health inspectors. Also, what does the BBMP have to say about the area having over 400 PGs and only 26 being on record? BBMP commissionerWe will look into the matter about deputing more health inspectors and verify the number of PGs in the area. More than 50 apartments in a block are considered bulk generators. K Prakash, member of Begur residents’ welfare associationOur areas come under the newly added 110 villages, a semi urban area which is largely neglected by the BBMP. The waste is not collected and roads are not laid. When will you address our issues?BBMP commissionerAfter 2007, 110 villages were added to the BBMP, increasing the area, and at the moment, the BWSSB is laying water and underground drainage pipeline. Once their work is completed, the BBMP will look into the roads and civic issues. Nagendar, resident of Bluejay Sunshine Hills, Karihobana halli, DoddabidirukalluA garbage processing unit is coming up in our locality within 50 meters of our residential layout.

'People in BMWs litter, how can we clean city?'	"Bengaluru's glory unless people take waste management seriously, Deputy Chief Minister Parameshwara said on Saturday. According to him, only a change in people's mindset can lead to visible improvements on the ground. ""Residents of RMV Extension in Sadashivanagar, where I stay, are supposed to be cultured. But very few of them segregate garbage. I have seen many people coming in BMW (cars) and throwing garbage on the roadside,"" he said, adding that such a mindset will defeat all government efforts. Parameshwara, who is also Bengaluru Development Minister, was speaking at 'Cleaning up Bengaluru: Garbage Collection and Disposal', a panel discussion organised by DH. He said the poor with no access to basic amenities cannot be expected to adopt sustainable practices when people having all the facilities do not follow simple rules. ""There are people living in pathetic conditions on the periphery of the city and we are spending crores of rupees to solve issues like garbage in developed areas,"" he said. The deputy chief minister also took questions from citizens and representatives of resident welfare associations.'Raise littering fine'When Ravi G, a resident of Nagarabhavi, sought an amendment in the law to increase the fine for littering, Parameshwara agreed that the step would act as a deterrent but also sounded a note of caution. ""We can't force people to pay a fine of Rs 5,000. First, awareness needs to be created among the public. Punishment can follow later,"" he said."	Parameshwara,Bengaluru,	 Oct 07 2018
CM: Work on ring road, elevated stretch soon	"elevated roads in Bengaluru at the earliest to address the traffic problems and the foundation stone for these two mega projects will be laid next month, Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy said on Saturday.""The government is serious about addressing the traffic problems, vehicular pollution and improving infrastructure in Bengaluru. In the first phase, the government will build ring roads and elevated roads at the earliest,"" the chief minister said while participating in a media event.Though there is opposition from some sections of the society to elevated roads, the government will address their concerns, the chief minister said.He said the first phase of the metro rail is already completed and work on the second phase is in progress and the government will approve the third phase soon.Petrol under GSTThe chief minister also said he was against bringing petroleum products under GST. With the implementation of GST, the states will be left with only three sources of revenue — fuel, excise and stamp duty imposed on land registration.Keeping the state's revenues in mind, bringing fuel prices under GST was not practical, he said.The chief minister also said the coalition government is stable and will complete its full five-year term without any hitch. He said Congress president Rahul Gandhi is fully backing him.“I will run this government. It is stable. I am here for five years. Some sections are predicting that the government will fall. My Congress friends and the high command are totally supporting me. Cabinet expansion is not a big issue for me,” he pointed outThe chief minister also said, ""There is no super CM in the government and people of Karnataka are super CMs.""He also sought the Centre's help to resolve the interstate water dispute."

Metro skips deadline, to reach Anjanapura next year	the work on Mysuru-Road Kengeri is expected to be completed only in 2020, a year later than the deadline set by the previous government.With this, the previous government’s announcement of opening the Yelachenahalli-Anjanapura line (6.29 km) by December 2018 and Mysore Road-Kengeri line (6.46) by mid-2020 has turned out to be a shallow promise.The then Bengaluru Development Minister K J George had announced about this during an inspection of metro work.Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) Managing Director Ajay Seth said civil work on the Anajanapura line would be completed only by April 2019.“We will be able to commission both the lines (Anjanapura and Kengeri) in 2020. I cannot give the precise month (for commissioning) at this juncture,” he said.Financial crisisThe financial crisis of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), the contractor for Mysore Road-Pattangere (3.95 km) stretch has reportedly hit the progress of work on the Kengeri line.“The contractor has finished 75% of the work, and we are looking into the issues. Work is going on, and the line will be commissioned in 2020,” he said.The BMRCL called tender for the Silk Board-KR Puram Metro line on Outer Ring Road (Phase 2A) in February. The deadline for submission of bids ended in May, following an extension of the last date for the bid submission.However, the financial bids are yet to be opened.Sources in BMRCL said IL&FS, a company since in financial crisis, has emerged the lowest bidder.Asked about the BMRCL’s decision on the bidder, the managing director said they were still evaluating the situation.“We have not yet awarded the tender for ORR Metro.

Bicycle sharing system may take off next week	and last mile connectivity? Then get ready to peddle as Namma Metro will soon offer free parking space for bicycles under public bicycle sharing (PBS) system, which is likely to be launched next week.Department of Urban Land Transport (Dult) special officer N Murali Krishna said two companies, Peddl and Yulu, have expressed readiness for a formal launch by October 10.“The government will decide on the launch date. Two players will deploy 1,000 bicycles in two clusters identified for the first phase,” he said.Dult has divided Bengaluru into eight clusters of 10 sq km each, and two clusters have been selected in the first phase. Cluster 1 includes a network of MG Road-Museum Road-Indiranagar-Ulsoor-Old Airport Road area network comes.Most of the HSR Layout-BTM Layout areas come under Cluster 2.Krishna said the department has identified and geo-tagged parking spaces in the two areas and similar work was being taken up in other parts of the city, which will get PBS in the next phases.“Three more companies have expressed interest, and their qualification will be decided in the next two weeks. The PBS can be extended to other areas once they come into play,” he added.Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has demarcated space for bicycles in 40 Metro stations. Those who hire PBS bicycles can park them for free in these spots, which will be suggested on the app of the respective service provider.“The parking space has been identified based on accessibility and convenience of passengers. By becoming part of PBS network, we will address some of the challenges in last-mile connectivity,” BMRCL Managing Director Ajay Seth said.Cycle tracks not readyWhile the PBS is envisioned to play a major role in the coming years by complimenting Metro, suburban rail and bus network, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has not been able to build the 130 km cycle track.According to officials so far, cycle track work has been completed in only small stretches of roads in the central business district and HSR Layout.“The idea of a complete cycle track is possible only if other agencies and private parties do not dig up the road. TenderSure project can deliver such roads,” a senior official said.However, a DULT official said mere cycle track network was not sufficient, but other vehicles on certain roads should also be restricted.“Changes in policy are needed to ban and restrict cars and motorbikes on some roads. Strict enforcement to ensure bikes do not enter cycle tracks is essential,” he said.	Yulu,Bicycle Sharing System,Peddl,	 Oct 04 2018
Cabinet to clear decks for suburban rail SPV	setting up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the implementation of suburban rail project as the Cabinet is expected to approve the restructuring of a company that will represent the state in SPV.The Railway Board had last year agreed to Karnataka’s proposal to constitute an SPV through the Karnataka Railway Infrastructure Development Corporation (K-RIDE), a company in which the government was a minority holder with 49% of shares.Sources in the government said the K-RIDE shares have been restructured and the government has become a major holder whereas private company I-DECK will hold 0.5% of the shares.“The government and the railways will decide whether K-RIDE will be part of SPV. Once the Cabinet approves new form of K-RIDE, a memorandum of understanding will be signed with the railways on the SPV,” the source said.It has also been proposed to increase the equity of K-RIDE from the present Rs 5 lakh to Rs 5 crore.“The higher equity will enable the company to borrow large loans while working on projects like suburban rail,” the source said.‘No need to wait for SPV’A senior official noted that the railways and the state government need not wait for the SPV to take up works.“The SPV will happen by the time the detailed project reports are prepared. K-RIDE can work with the railways on suburban rail-related projects even before,” he said.Since the state government and the railways have agreed for equal sharing of equity and borrowings, there should be no hindrance to take up works. Besides, the SPV will take over the expenditures and borrowings from K-RIDE.Works like doubling and electrification of the Byappanahalli-Hosur line, for which tender has already been called, and quadrupling of the Cantonment-Whitefield line can be expedited once the state government pitches in through K-RIDE, the official said.The Rs 12,000-crore suburban rail project sanctioned by the Union government envisages a 100km rail network, including doubling and quadrupling, for local trains. Announced in the 2017 budget, the project has been stuck due to delay in the formation of SPV.	Suburban railway,SPV,	 Oct 04 2018

Not just for cars, but also for two-wheelers, especially after the rise of renting bikes.Shikha said since there already have been delays, the locations have been chosen in such a way so that work can be completed at the earliest.To set up the stations, the Bescom has chosen the places which are close to 11 KV lines and have sufficient space for two DC and AC charging stations according to the Ministry of Power Guidelines — space for a car and a two-wheeler.In the coming days, the Bescom will look for spaces around BBMP head office, Metro rail parking lots, BMTC depots, bus terminals, BWSSB offices and other government offices.Charging station locations1- N4 Sub-division office, Peenya2- C6 Sub-division office, Mathikere3- C7 Sub-division office, Yelahanka4- E8 Sub-division office, Banaswadi5- Indiranagar division office, HAL 2nd Stage6- Mahadevapura O&M office7- S7 Sub-division office, Murugeshpalya, HAL8- HSR division office, HSR 2nd Sector9- BTM O&M Unit- 2, BTM Layout10- Kathriguppe O&M office11- BICC-2, DAS, near ESI, Rajajinagar"	Charging Stations,BESCOM,Electric Vehicles,	 Oct 03 2018
SC allows owners to contest land acquisition for layout	"the High Court of Karnataka, allowing a group of landowners from southern Bengaluru to oppose the proceedings initiated by Poornaprajna House Building Co-Operative Society Ltd before a trial court for removing them from a portion of 120 acres of land acquired by the state government for creating a residential colony. A bench of Justices R Banumathi and Indira Banerjee issued a notice to C Bhagya and others on a special leave petition filed by the housing co-op challenging the validity of the order passed by the high court on January 11. ""Issue notice. There shall be (a) stay of the proceedings until further orders from this court,"" the bench ordered on the petition argued by advocate Sanjay M Nuli. The housing co-op claimed the high court allowed the landowners to file documents and written statements before the trial court, condoning a delay of three-and-a-half years in contravention of the Civil Procedure Code which prescribed a limit of 120 days for the purpose. It further contended that the landowners had entered an appearance in the trial court in 2012 but chose not to file any written statement. The housing co-op had filed a suit before the trial court for the declaration of the title and demolition of illegal constructions over three acres and 11 guntas of land in Uttarahalli hobli, Bengaluru South taluk. The high court, in its order, however, noted there were 79 landowners and some of them entered into a compromise with the housing co-op. It would be a grave injustice if other landowners were not allowed to contest their case. The high court also noted that the time limit put under the CrPC was not mandatory but only directory and thus it did not put an embargo on the power of the court to extend the time. It imposed Rs 24,000 as a cost on the writ petitioners but directed it to be paid by the Legal Services Authority."	Poornaprajna House Building Co-Operative Society Ltd,	 Oct 02 2018
Doubling of Baiyappanhalli-Hosur line to start soon	"has invited bids for civil work on the doubling of the Baiyappanahalli-Hosur line, months after the Centre approved the Rs 376-crore project. The doubling will help introduce more trains to IT corridor in the southern parts of Bengaluru. The civil work on the 48-km stretch has been divided into five packages, each varying in distances between 7 km and 11 km. The South Western Railway has set an October 23 deadline for submission of the bids. Once the tender is awarded, the contractor will get 18 months to complete the project, which includes earthwork in cutting, embankment and construction of major and minor bridges as well as railway under bridges. With this, work on doubling is likely to begin in the next two months. Once the land is prepared, the railways will call tenders for laying track and electrification works. This should be following by automatic block signalling and intermediate block signalling works, which are an integral part of the suburban rail network.Urban transport activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar said the railways should take up work on additional stations in the same breath. ""Stations should be built every two to three kilometres or even less. The railways should also eliminate all the level crossings near Kaggadasapura, Hellalige and Anekal Road and other places along the route at the same time,"" he said.Previously, activists have submitted a demand for building 10 additional stations along the Yashwantpur-Hosur route. Of them, Doddanekkundi, Munnekolala, Huskur Road, Chandapur and KHB Layout Suryanagar are located between Baiyappanahalli and Hosur.Noting that the state government has agreed to share 50% of the project cost, Dyamannavar said the railways should take up a comprehensive project at once to bring relief to commuters."	suburban rail network,	 Oct 02 2018
Segregating garbage at source turning futile: Residents	was a daily fight with the civic workers as the latter was collecting garbage from all neighbouring houses, except hers.After frequent fights, Apeksha had no choice but to segregate waste at source.“I have now understood how much of effort it requires to segregate the waste. But it pains to know that all the effort goes waste,” said Apeksha.In February 2017, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) made it mandatory to separate the waste at source. By April, there were reports of the city achieving up to 50% of segregation at source. However, due to lack of will in enforcing stricter laws and regulations, the percentage has been steadily declining, said solid waste management experts.“As of now, the city is segregating about 40% of garbage,” said N S Ramakant, a solid waste management expert.While most citizens do not even know that the BBMP has made it mandatory to segregate waste, some claim that there was no use in doing it as everything gets mixed in the end.“I have been segregating waste, but the dry waste collection does not happen here. And finally, the sanitation workers mix both,” said Smruthi Zacharia, a resident of Jayanagar 5th Block.“There is an absolute lack of political will to enforce stringent rules. A couple of other reasons, such as missing auto tippers and compactors, and lack of enforcing micro plan rules also add to the problem,” said Ramakant.“The civic body can learn lessons from Muzzafurpur in Bihar. They introduced segregation at source a year ago. Out of 35 wards, 90% of them have achieved it already,” he said.BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, however, believes that the entire process can be successful only if citizens participate.“In this huge city, where about 4,500 metric tonnes of garbage is generated daily, it is humanly impossible to sort this issue without the help of residents. Most of them do not segregate garbage, and even if some do, it is unfortunate that some sanitation workers mix it or all get mixed up in the end. Creating more awareness and informing about the benefits of the initiative has to be done more,” said Prasad.	waste segregation,Solid Waste Management,	 Oct 02 2018
Designer leaf composters to treat Bengaluru's waste	stop tonnes of leaf waste heading straight to the landfills, and instead use them to produce compost to green Bengaluru. Initiated by the social startup Daily Dump, a collective design intervention is now underway to fabricate a unique leaf composter that is cheap, aesthetic, functional and commercially viable.Showcased at the ongoing Bangalore Design Week, the designs stand out for their visual appeal. But their functionality would be tested once the drawing board designs morph into prototypes. Mass production will then be explored through a tripartite tie-up that includes Daily Dump, the design studio and corporate partners.So, what thinking went into the designs, one of which might just give Bengaluru a green makeover?Chinmay Dholakia from Ether Designs explains: “We have gone into a different scale of manufacturing that saves cost, offers beautiful possibilities of shape and form, keeps cost low, reduces parts and joinery; a single monolithic shape of sorts.”The idea was to stick to a design that scores high on adaptability.“Our approach was oriented for mass production. Look at how the Sintex tank and a particular form of a plastic chair has become hugely popular due to their adaptability. Our concept was to use recycled engineering plastics, roto moulding and make the composter sturdy,” says Dholakia. Simplicity is at the core of the composter’s design.“Sweep the leaves off parks and streets and dump them into the cylindrical composter. Water it regularly for the first month or so, and take out the compost through an outlet at the bottom after four to six months.” The more the leaves are composted, the better the end product. “Compost could be sold for Rs 4 a kg if it is four months old. You can charge Rs 8 a kilo if it is six to seven months old.”An alternative concept, the 'Flexa Compostor' proposes using a simple plastic tarpaulin stitched into a sack. “The material is easily available, can be reused, is weather-proof and rugged. The sack has plastic rivets which creates adequate air movement within. Similar orifices at the container bottom allow water to drain out when needed,” Flexa’s designers explain.

Metro's 2nd six-car train to run from Thursday	"Thursday. A bridge that links the Kempegowda (Majestic) metro station to the BMTC bus station will also be inaugurated that day. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) Managing Director Ajay Seth confirmed to DH that Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy will flag off the second six-car train on Thursday.A source said the bridge in Majestic, which was ready over three months ago, will be inaugurated the same day. ""The chief minister is also expected to ride the metro until Nagasandra from where he is scheduled to take part in an event at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre,"" the source said.The BMRCL received three intermediate cars on September 6. Work on the formation of the six-car train was done at the Peenya depot. The big train would be introduced on the Purple Line (Baiyappanahalli-Mysore Road), which still sees a heavy rush. Metro's daily ridership climbed high after the introduction of the first six-car train with numbers touching 4.3 lakhs on August 20. Officials expect that the addition of two more six-car trains will help reach the target of five lakh riders per day."	Six-coach train,BMRCL,Namma Metro,	 Oct 02 2018
L&T said to win contract to build KIA's 2nd terminal	has reportedly clinched the deal to build the first phase of the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA)'s second terminal. Airport sources confirmed the deal but indicated that the company will be coming out with the details soon. L&T had built the airport's first runway and also bagged the contract to construct the KIA's second runway. The first phase of the airport's second terminal is scheduled to be completed by March 2021. Once this phase is operationalised, the airport's combined capacity is expected to exceed 45 Million Passengers Per Annum (MPPA). The airport had crossed the 25 MPPA mark in 2017. Besides L&T, three Indian companies and a Turkish firm were in competition for the contract. Sources said the total cost of the first phase was pegged at Rs 3,000 crore, although this could not be immediately verified. Since its commercial launch in 2008, the Bengaluru airport has emerged as India's third busiest, after Mumbai and Delhi. In April, the KIA operator, Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), had announced that it served 26.91 MPPA in the financial year 2017-18. A total of 44 airlines link the KIA to 46 domestic and 21 international destinations. The Airports Regulatory Authority of India (AERA) had directed the BIAL to complete the second terminal's first phase by March 2021. It had also warned that a penalty would be levied if the deadline is exceeded. Aviation experts had noted that the deadline could be challenging since the new terminal would have to be seamlessly integrated with the second runway, and all landing/take-off trials should be completed before commissioning T2.

Now, cobblestones to adorn Jayanagar and Hudson Circle	engineers, of late. After laying cobblestones on the Church Street and Anand Rao Circle junction, the BBMP is now using the same at Shivarathreeshwara circle in Jayanagar 7th Block.This five-legged junction is particularly chosen as it involves the movement of a lot of vehicles, and connects some important places such as Kanakapura Road, Banashankari 2nd Stage, Jayanagar 8th Block, Yediyur and Jayanagar 4th Block, said KT Nagaraj, chief engineer, road infrastructure (projects), BBMP.“Laying cobblestones will help in smooth movement of traffic and pedestrians. This project also aims to increase the aesthetics of the junction,” said Praveen Lingaiah, traffic engineering cell, BBMP.Residents apprehensiveOn the other hand, some residents and motorists have expressed their concern over the durability of the work.Akshay Naidu from Jayanagar 5th block said: “We have read reports of how cobblestones are coming out or loosening, just months after they were laid on the Church Street. The vehicle movement here is much higher. With the kind of work that the BBMP undertakes, it is important to know how long will this last.”The work is going on mostly during the night, causing less hindrance to traffic movement during the day, said Lingaiah.Similarly, another resident, Ramya K expressed her concern about waterlogging problems.“We all have heard about how the stagnant water causes problems to the white-topping. The question is whether they will maintain and resolve such issues,” she said.The cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 40 lakh and, the work is expected to be complete in another 15 days, said Lingaiah.The BBMP has taken a similar exercise at the Hudson Circle also.Another official from the civic body said the BBMP was planning to lay cobblestone from Jayanagar 4th Block (Cool Joint signal) to JP Nagar 24th Main for a stretch of 25 kilometres. The cost of the project would be Rs 25 crore.	Cobblestone,Jayanagar,Hudson Circle,	 Oct 01 2018
Rs 100 fine not enough to curb littering: Experts	"city and get away with a fine of just Rs 100, there will be no respite from the garbage menace, experts have said and called for a change in policy to solve the problem. In 2013, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) began levying a penalty in a bid to implement waste segregation and management in the city. As per the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (Amendment) Act, 1976, littering, spitting, urinating, open defecation and other acts of nuisance on the roads, bus stations, railway stations, playgrounds and other premises of public utility attract a fine of Rs 100 for the first time and Rs 200 for subsequent offences. For domestic occupiers, unsegregated waste attracts a penalty of Rs 100 for the first offence and Rs 500 for subsequent offences. Meanwhile, for bulk generators or commercial complexes, it is Rs 500 for the first offence and Rs 1,000 for subsequent offences. Sandhya Narayan, a member of the Solid Waste Management Round Table and SWM Expert Committee, said: ""The fine was fixed six years ago and needs to be increased. Also, not much is known about enforcement or how much fine the BBMP has collected for non-segregation of waste or for other offences related to waste management."" N Manjunath Prasad, Commissioner, BBMP, agreed that the penalty needs to be increased and that the civic body must enforce it rigorously. ""Most are not bothered about the penalty. They are ready to pay the fine and litter."" Construction waste and debris As if things weren't bad, the illegal dumping of construction debris is only adding to the garbage menace. The city generates around 3,600 tonnes of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste per day, making Bengaluru the fourth largest generator of construction debris in the country, as per a report by Vijinapura Eco Civic Team (VECT). Currently, the fine for dumping C&D waste is Rs 5,000. In 2017, the then Mayor R Sampath Raj had proposed to hike the fine to Rs 1 lakh."	Garbage crisis,BBMP,Littering,	 Oct 01 2018
BDA struggling to sell CA sites in Kempegowda Layout	"sites at Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout are getting returned, prompting the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) to renotify them.Though the BDA had notified 18 CA sites in the layout, it had responses for 10 of them. ""We've received applications for schools, hospitals and samudaya bhavans (community halls),"" a BDA official told DH, admitting that the response has been far below their expectations.Those applying for the CA sites had apparently told the BDA that they will develop them in the long run, meaning they will probably violate BDA rules to develop the sites immediately and would rather wait for infrastructure to be ready.In fact, many have withdrawn their applications to buy the sites due to lack of facilities and the considerable distance to the layout from the city. This has left the BDA anxious since this is the first time citizens are rejecting CA sites.Measuring between 0.5 and four acres, the CA sites do not include parks and playgrounds, which the BDA has planned to create on buffer zones basis.The authority’s rules stipulate that 10% of the layout should be reserved for the CA sites. In Kempegowda Layout, the land reserved for the CA site is less.In the first and second phase, the BDA had formed 5,000 sites each. ""The CA sites have been carved out based on the availability of space in the layout with the BDA. The engineering wing had identified 22 CA sites, but only 18 were notified for people and four are reserved for the government agencies,"" the official said.The Kempegowda Layout is sprawled over 4043.27 acres, of which 2383.11 acres is with the BDA and is litigation-free. In this land, the BDA marked out 17,900 sites and 18 CA sites.It held the last meeting on CA sites on September 25, but the final list of allottees was not decided. BDA sources said the final list of CA allottees will be decided by Deputy Chief Minister and Bengaluru Development Minister G Parameshwara instead of the BDA board.""After he finalises the list, a resolution will be passed and signed by the BDA secretary. The list will then be made public,"" a BDA source said."	BDA,Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout,	 Oct 01 2018
BBMP looks to sky to shore up property tax collection	"at the sky, literally, to shore up its flagging property tax collection. Starting next year, the civic body will use satellite imagery to map property data with the help of Bhuvan, the Indian Space Research Organisation's software application that allows users to explore a 2D/3D representation of the surface of the earth. The BBMP had signed up a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with ISRO in 2016 to provide the software application for improving its Geographical Information System (GIS) data. A source in the BBMP said: ""ISRO recently conducted training sessions for us. Satellite imagery will be captured for analysing property tax data."" An official working closely on the project said that the focus right now was on integrating the BBMP's property tax data with Bhuvan. ""The applications of the technology and data into the specific areas will be taken up in due course depending on the functional feasibility of technology with the nature of the data available,"" he added. ""The clear satellite imagery will help the BBMP check violations that property owners have done."" BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, however, dismissed a media report that the satellite imagery would be used to identify potholes and other civic problems. ""We, along with ISRO, are working on the technology to identify properties in the city. There is no way we'll use this technology to identify potholes and other civic issues. That's just a figment of someone's imagination,"" he told DH. Property tax is the BBMP's only major source of revenue but the civic body has been consistently failing in meeting the target. In the last fiscal year, it collected just Rs 1,665 crore, as against the target of Rs 2,600 crore from an estimated 16 lakh properties in the city."

'City to be rid of illegal hoardings in 2 weeks'	campaign to rid the city of illegal hoardings. The civic body has begun dismantling the hoarding structures which do not hold the advertisements or banners any longer. According to the BBMP Commissioner, N Manjunath Prasad, they have removed at least 100 gantries so far and the remaining 500 are expected to be dismantled in the next two weeks in all the eight BBMP zones.On August 14, the BBMP had issued a public notice asking the concerned agencies to bring down the metal structures which hold the hoardings by August 30. Failing which the civic body would dismantle them and recover the cost from the owners and agencies of the hoarding. The civic body then pushed the deadline to September 6 and warned the agencies of legal action. The BBMP had filed 759 FIRs against the hoardings' owners who didn't remove them within the stipulated deadline. The civic body had served 1,848 final notices. However, 271 owners have obtained a stay order from the court against the notice.	BBMP,illegal hoardings,	 Sep 30 2018
Koliwad committee turns a blind eye	H D Kumaraswamy, then an opposition leader, initiated a heated debate in which he took the Congress government to task over the state of waterbodies in Bengaluru. In October that year, the state Assembly formed an 11-member House Committee headed by former Speaker KB Koliwad. The panel was to look into encroachment of lakes in and around Bengaluru. Storm water drain encroachments also came under the committee’s purview.Prior to the formation of the committee, a special drive to remove encroachments of tank beds in Bengaluru was abruptly halted. There was public outrage over demolition of houses near the Puttenahalli lake because it was the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) that had permitted them to be built. The BDA later admitted, shockingly, that it had formed 23 layouts on tank beds.The House committee came as a blessing in disguise for the state government and erring officials. It was decided to halt demolition of encroached properties on BDA layouts until the House committee came out with its report.Thus began the saga of officials and builders taking shelter under the Koliwad committee, which took three full years to come out with its final report that experts say was not only vague but also fraught with contradictions.The committee’s report stated that 501.11 acres of the network had been encroached by 2,083 encroachers. Authorities began passing the buck on clearing encroachments while the committee dragged its feet.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which was dependent on surveyors to identify and mark drain encroachment, pointed fingers at the Revenue Department, which in turn looked towards the House committee for its final report. In November 2017, the committee tabled its final report before the Legislative Assembly. It suggested a way out: diversion of drains wherever possible. “The natural drains that carried rainwater along the slope to join another canal have been altered to benefit urban projects,” the committee noted. “It must be observed here that we must consider existing drains that are carrying out the function of the natural system that once existed. Otherwise, trying to restore the natural system would involve cancellation of projects and destruction of the location, which is not appropriate.”In other words, the committee, while acknowledging that drains had been diverted, legitimised it.In another recommendation, the committee asked the government to restore drains where the alternative canals had failed. “In such cases, the committee recommends indiscriminate removal of encroachments regardless of the person or building involved,” the report stated.“It is deplorable that the committee brought legalities into the illegalities,” said water expert V Ramprasad. “The valley contours of Bengaluru will not support diversion of drains, because water will invariably flow in the natural slope,” he pointed out.Around the same time the Koliwad committee submitted its report, the Environmental Management and Policy Research Institute (EMPRI) also finalised its draft report on Inventorisation of Water Bodies in Bengaluru Metropolitan Area. Contrary to the Koliwad committee, the EMPRI recommended eviction of drain encroachers.“The storm water drains are like veins, which feed water to the waterbodies. The diversion of storm water channel has led to the dry condition of the waterbodies, so the diversion should be prohibited and should not be included in the waterbodies rejuvenation activity,” EMPRI stated.Defending the committee’s report back then, Koliwad had said: “The government can explore the possibility of diverting Rajakaluves, if possible, instead of bringing huge structures down.”This came as a relief to a hospital belonging to senior Congress leader Shamanur Shivashankarappa and the house of Sandalwood actor Darshan, both located in Rajarajeshwari Nagar. The hospital and the actor’s house were issued demolition notices, but alas.In a landmark ruling in May 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had redefined buffer zone as 50m from the edge of primary Rajakaluves, 35m from secondary Rajakaluves and 25m from tertiary Rajakaluves. Construction activity was prohibited in this space. The Koliwad committee stated that since the NGT order was being heard by the Supreme Court, the government was asked to act based on the outcome of the case.The Koliwad committee also refrained from naming erring officials, builders and government bodies that encroached waterbodies and drains. Instead, it recommended setting up of a judicial commission to identify and act against those responsible for encroachments.The committee did suggest a way forward for the Urban Development Department. It asked authorities to ensure, during approval and formation of new layouts, the drainage systems are capable of carrying water in line with the watershed requirements while retaining the direction in which the water naturally flows in that region. The Koliwad committee report is pending before Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, whose pronounced concern for waterbodies led to the House panel’s birth.READ MORENo action on officials, builders for drain encroachment	drain encroachment,	 Sep 30 2018
Restoration of SWDs key to city’s survival	These structures are unique to Bengaluru. Unlike most other cities in the world, Bengaluru has no perennial river.Arakavathi, Suvarnamukhi and Kumudavathi are only seasonal streams. Therefore, since 1537 when Kempegowda established Bengaluru, lakes were constructed. His son, Immadi Kempe Gowda, and grandson established more lakes. This was followed by the Marathas, Wodeyars, Tipu Sultan and the British.With an elevation of 3,000 feet, Bengaluru slopes on all directions. A cascading system of lakes was established with 30-feet-wide Rajakaluves, dug from one lake to the next, taking the excess water till the last level of lakes, thus storing the 800mm normal annual rainfall in nature’s most effective Rainwater Harvesting System. The SWD is, therefore, the crux of the city’s water supply over centuries.However, what has been lovingly built over the past five centuries, Bengaluru has managed to destroy in 50 years. One of the biggest tanks, the Dharmambudhi Kere, expanded by Kempe Gowda, is now the Central Bus Terminus, ironically named after Kempe Gowda, making him turn in his grave. The government itself breached at least 43 tanks and constructed stadiums, colleges, offices and Golf clubs. This encouraged greedy citizens in forming private lake “Layouts”, some of the MLAs affixing the title Layout to their names!The SWDs are the channels which connected the famed ‘thousand lakes’ of Bengaluru, forming an integrated system. Within the BBMP area of 780km² there is a length of 857 km of SWDs. But, these vital SWDs have been totally neglected since the two Municipal Boards of the Bangalore City Municipality and the Cantonment were merged into form the Corporation of the City of Bangalore in 1949 and 70 councilors were elected from 50 wards. The city’s population in 1951 was 7.8 lakh and it is now 112 lakh.The lakes will survive only if the SWDs exist to take the overflow of water from the higher level lakes to the lower lakes. As the SWDs are destroyed, even with two inches of rain, the water flows onto the roads, which become canals. Worse, the SWDs are used even by the BWSSB to let in domestic sewage so that each remaining lake in Bangalore Urban Revenue district (of its original 937 according to Revenue Records of Villages) stores domestic sewage, apart from industrial effluents, and none of the lake water is fit for drinking.In 2010, a Master Plan was prepared for the restoration and remodelling of the damaged SWDs at a cost of Rs 4,158 crore. This was shelved by the Government and two years ago, a paltry Rs 800 crore was sanctioned to take up this work, obviously in politically important wards. But, it is not realised that restoration of SWDs is not just removal of encroachment, which itself is a huge task, but more importantly involve desilting, widening, deepening, constructing masonry walls, box drains, culverts, shifting of sewage from the SWDs, etc. This is a mammoth task and government’s sanctioning of Rs 800 crore or so is like offering popcorn to the hungry elephant. Two years ago, the BBMP with fanfare started removal of encroachments on SWDs under the High Court directions but was stopped in its tracks when properties of political and film personalities were encountered. Recently, the government has initiated prosecution proceeding against 20 senior officers for permitting important persons to encroach upon SWDs.Citizens of Bengaluru do not realise that restoration of SWDs is the key to restoration of lakes which in turn is necessary for the survival of Bengaluru. There are 25 lakh tenements in BBMP’s population of 112 lakh according to Census-2011 of which the BWSSB’s water and drainage connection covers only 40%. The rest depends upon borewells and according to the study of NITI Aayog recently, Bengaluru will run out of groundwater in just two years.Not only that. The 60% population which has no drainage connection, produce 128 grams of night soil per capita daily, which is 800 tonnes per day and 3 lakh tonnes per year. Most of this human excreta finds its way to the lakes which is why the Land of a Thousand Lakes has now become a Land of a Thousand Sewage Tanks. The sewage does not simply sit in the tank beds but percolates into the groundwater and into the borewells.Bellandur and Varthur are burning. Waiting in the queue are Byramangala, Yele Mallappa Chetty, Kaggadaspura, Yemmlur, Iblur and sixty more. Bengalureans have not realised the seriousness of Bellandur burning.In Karnataka, the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the Pollution Control Board came into existence in 1974 and the lakes are burning since 2017.

Underpass work to add to traffic on Varthur bridge	will endure unsustainable levels of traffic as work on an underpass at Kundalahalli junction in Whitefield begins.Kundalahalli junction is a vital link to the areas in IT corridor like ITPL, Hoodi, Marathahalli, Domlur and other surrounding areas.Heavy vehicles roll by this junction in their thousands from places like Hoskote, Kadugodi, Whitefield, Varthur and Sarjapura.When the underpass work at the junction picks up, all the vehicles will be routed through Belagere road, which is also the only alternative for commuters to circumvent the traffic snarl at the junction.“Office-goers choose the shortest and the most convenient route,” said Naveen A, a commuter. “Google Maps suggests Belagere road as the best route to reach IT corridors around Marathahalli and Bellandur.”And here is the catch: vehicles must first pass through the Varthur bridge to reach Belagere road.The heavy traffic will be an added stress on the bridge, which, regular commuters say, has begun to wobble again. “The BBMP has completed the grouting work, but is yet to seal the cracks with the bonding agent,” said Jagadish Reddy, Varthur lake warden.Reddy said residents are alerting the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike on the repeatedly developing cracks and have urged the civic body to take action. “Until the new bridge (adjacent to the old one) comes up, we’ve to commute with fear and anger,” Reddy added.The repair work should have been completed three months ago. Now, BBMP officials say it would go on for two more weeks. “The delay is due to paucity of labour. We’ve the materials ready on site and will finish the work soon,” a BBMP official said.The Palike’s chief engineer KT Nagaraj said work for the underpass has just begun at Kundalahalli junction. “Right now, we’re sorting out water pipes and Bescom utilities,” he said.

BTM Layout residents adopt Kuvempu Park	with the BBMP’s maintenance of the parks in their area, and they were tired of complaining.In the end, they decided to adopt the biggest of the 13 parks in the area — Kuvempu park — and turn it into a model green space.“The Kuvempu park here needs at least Rs 25,000 for its maintenance and a part of it is contributed by residents. We cannot take over all the 13 parks for maintenance as we cannot afford it,” said A Vidyashankar, a senior member of the Madiwala Tank Lake Foundation and president of Joint Action Committee, BTM Layout.Residents said the parks lack facilities like water, lights and security. This despite the fact that the state government releases funds once in two years for park maintenance. “Having security guards is important in a fast-growing area like BTM Layout,” Vidyashankar said.As they take up the maintenance of the Kuvempu park, BTM Layout residents ask citizens in other localities to adopt parks, too.“We have not appointed any full-fledged security guards in the parks, but we will appoint them if there is a need in any of the parks,” said Niranjan, horticulture superintendent (south zone).He said vehicles to pick up garbage from the parks are despatched once in a fortnight. “Not much garbage accumulates in the parks. Most of the solid waste is foliage. We have asked residents not to carry plastic materials into the park,” he said.	BBMP,BTM Layout,park,	 Sep 30 2018

For the residents of Whitefield, it is a shrine of old and delightful books and magazines. Having a membership of around 700 people, the library witnesses an average footfall of about 30 people every day. Yet it is poorly maintained. “The library lacks proper drinking water facilities and lights. Even the books, magazines and papers are not properly arranged,” said a volunteer of the civic initiative Whitefield Rising. It was Whitefield Rising volunteers who brought the poor condition of the library, located in Whitefield Inner Circle Park, to the notice of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). They have helped to arrange some of the bookshelves. “It got a makeover in 2016 thanks to the efforts of bibliophiles and volunteers. Whitefield Rising and the Rotary Bangalore IT Corridor joined hands to give a facelift to the library. They received funds from the State Bank of India. The library could be further improved if the books tied up in gunny bags are arranged properly on the shelves and proper facilities are provided,” said Pravir Bagrodia, another volunteer. The efforts of Whitefield Rising brought about a visit by C Parvathamma, Deputy Director (Libraries), BBMP, on Saturday. She promised that all necessary facilities will be provided. Beginning with fixing the lights, she has promised that an RO water purifier will be provided soon for drinking water. “I will ensure that all genres of books are provided in the library.

Break in Green Line services traps people at KG station	(Yelachenahalli-Nagasandra) led to heavy crowd at the Kempegowda metro station on Thursday morning.A train from Yelachenahalli to Nagasandra halted near the National College metro station around 9.46 am. Train movements on both the lines were disrupted for the next hour till services were restored at 10.57 am, a release from the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) said.“There was a large crowd at the Kempegowda metro station as trains were not moving. Especially on the Green Line platforms, the security guards had a tough time as many passengers lost patience,” a BMRCL official said.BMRCL said the train had to be withdrawn from passenger service and the process delayed the running of the other train. The crowd at Kempegowda was the cumulative effect of the delay, it said.The official said disruption in services on any line will inevitably lead to a crisis-like situation at the Kempegowda station. “As it was the peak hour, there were many people who were getting late to office and that led to angry exchanges,” a commuter said.Additional trainThe BMRCL deployed additional trains from Nagasandra, Rajajinagar and Peenya Industry metro station to ease the situation.“Before normalcy was restored, passengers travelling in the train at National College, Rajajinagar, Peenya Industry and Sampige Road stations had to be detrained and cleared by the following trains,” the release said.

BDA to take up repair of Hebbal Flyover immediately	work on the Hebbal Flyover after a minor crack developed on one of its loop last week. All officials have been asked to take up investigation and maintenance work of the Hebbal Flyover on an immediate basis. Though the crack developed on a section that is being maintained by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), the BDA has now taken it upon itself to repair it.“For people’s safety and to ensure that there is no untoward incident the BDA has decided to take up the maintenance of the flyover. However NHAI will have to cooperate. The work will be taken up immediately after conducting an inspection. The cost has not been decided yet,” the source added.These decisions were taken at a high-level meeting convened on Tuesday to address the issues faced by the arterial link connecting north Bengaluru with the Kempegowda International Airport.During the meeting three key issues were highlighted- lapses on the part of the BDA in maintaining the flyover, water logging in the drains and sewage lines and the need to recheck all the bearings. “All the bearings are submerged in the stagnated water. That needs to be cleared. The commuters are also facing a lot of problem due to that. The officials were questioned about why it was not cleared in the last two days. The bearings will also have to be checked. Another problem we face is that the Hebbal lake is filled to the brim. The BWSSB has been directed to handle the water-logging issue on war-footing,” sources present in the meeting told DH.Officials from BDA, NHAI, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) have been asked to take immediate action.

A division bench of Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari and Justice S G Pandit continued hearing PIL petitions on Monday, which was also the deadline for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to ensure there were no potholes on roads. Advocate V Srinidhi, who represented the BBMP, said the civic body had taken up the repair on a war footing. “Potholes in 90% of the roads have been filled,” he added. He further said newly-discovered potholes were still being filled. The chief justice, however, said it was not enough to fill potholes in a hurry. “The quality of repairs should be good. Give us details of the repair in every ward,” he said. The BBMP counsel said all potholes in the following zones were filled: Malleswaram, west zone: 7 out of 44 wards; Mahalakshmi Layout, west zone; 7 wards; Yelahanka zone: four out of 11 wards. The BBMP has taken the services of G L Sivakumar Babu, Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, IISc, and Rajib B Mallick, Professor, Civil Engineering, IISc. The BBMP counsel also submitted a status report on potholes by revealing the identity of the roads, the name of the contractors, the size of the potholes and the date of attending to the potholes with the images taken before and after execution of the work. The chief justice then ordered that a commission appointed by the court would inspect the work. The court said the commission would consist of Dinesh Agarwal, Superintending Engineer, CWE (Army), and Karnataka State Legal Services Authority member secretary M G Uma. Additional Solicitor General Prabhuling K Navadgi and Additional Advocate General A S Ponnanna would assist the commission. “A team led by the BBMP chief engineer will start the inspection at 3.30 pm,” he said.

Infosys foundation revives Chola-era Kalyani 	(temple tank) on the premises of the Chola-era Vasantha Vallabharaya Temple in South Bengaluru on Monday.The Infosys Foundation restored the tank, which faced the threat of being reduced to half its size by land grabbers, to its original form.Legend has it that Chhatrapati Shivaji’s father Shahaji Raje Bhonsle constructed the Kalyani sometime in the mid 17th century to mark the acquisition of Bengaluru as his jagir. It is said Bhonsle had won this jagir after defeating Kempegowda-III.Over a period of time, the temple tank, which is spread over two acres on paper, was in danger of disappearing due to officials apathy.The foundation has spent Rs 8.5 crore for the restoration work and handed over the tank to the muzrai department in the presence of the chief minister.DH had earlier reported the attempts to grab the temple tank and money meant for the Kalyani development.

4 lakes in city south breach from heavy rain	– Dorekere Lake, Gubbalala Lake, Vasanthapura Lake and Doddakallasandra Lake have all breached due to heavy rain in the wee hours of Monday.Areas around the Kanakapura Road received maximum rainfall recording more than 124 mm rain around Konanakunte, Doddakallasandra, Uttarahalli, and Rajarajeshwarinagar, Kengeri and Hemmigepura.The lakes breached and flooded the stormwater drains and even entered houses in many low-lying areas. Despite the BBMP stating to have taken measures to ensure that the lake water does not flood residential areas, it seems like it was only assurance and no actual work is done.DH based on a BBMP report had on June 30, 2018, reported that the five lakes in Bengaluru South are likely to breach this monsoon.Sunday night rain brought horror to residents of Saptagiri Layout, Lakshmaiah Layout and Lakkanna Layout, with over 200 houses flooded with the rainwater in the wee hours on Monday.These layouts are located behind Subramanyapura police station in Uttarahalli.Shivanagamma, who owns a flour mill in the area, was in a shock to find her mill submerged in the rainwater.“The motors are in a good condition. But if the water gets into the motors, they will stop functioning, and we will lose our livelihood. We drained the water and removed the motors from the machine. But we are not sure if the mill can function now,” she added.Asha Babu, another resident, said there was water up to four feet in the area and, contaminated water entered the sump in her house.“We woke up at around 2 am and have not slept a wink since then as there is a fear of flood. Every year during rains, there was waterlogging on the streets. But this time, the water has entered the houses,” she added. Savitha Jayasimha broke while explaining the difficulty she faced protecting her children who were sleeping when the house was flooded.“For the past three years, it has been continuously flooding, and there is no one to stop this. I had to wake up my children to move them to a safer place when the water entered the houses,” she added.Uttarahalli coporator Hanumanthaiah, who visited the area, said since Dorekere Lake breached due to the heavy rain, the overflowing stormwater drain in the downstream flooded many areas including Saptagiri Layout.A local resident said an apartment was constructed on the stormwater drain and the Bangalore International Public School had also encroached upon the drain. And so there is very less space for the rainwater to flow.Three upstream lakes of Hulimavu — Subrayanapura, Kalena Agrahara and Basavanapura — are also said to have overflown.Doddakallasandra, the erstwhile gram panchayat village located off Kanakapura Road, was turned into a sludge after the rain.The village is now the part of 110 villages. The BBMP had dug up the road on Kumaran School to lay underground drainage pipelines.After the rain, with the sludge filling the entire area, it became difficult for the commuters even to walk on the road and many vehicles got stuck in the sludge.

Banaswadi-Hosur train service to resume in December	the Banaswadi-Hosur train is likely to resume in December once the railway track renewal gets over. The introduction of four services (two from each side) had given hope to people fighting for suburban services. The trains from Banaswadi have an added advantage of being connected to the metro station at Baiyappanahalli, an aspect that urban transport activists have been stressing for years. The railways cancelled the train services between May 26 and October 25 for the renewal and maintenance work. Officials had promised to restart the services once the work is completed in October. But this could happen only in December, South Western Railway Chief Public Relations Officer E Vijaya said. “Track renewal works are expected to continue until November, and the train services will be considered for introduction in December,” she added.‘Make it passenger-friendly’Meanwhile, the SWR has released a data showing poor occupancy of trains, each of which has a seating capacity of 650 people. While the average ridership on the four services was less than 10%, the afternoon train from Banaswadi saw an occupancy of just 4.91%. Suhas Narayanamurthy, a software engineer who travels regularly between Hebbal and Heelalige, said the ridership would go up automatically if the railways aligned its services with passengers’ needs. “Structural changes are needed to make trains on the Hosur line passenger-friendly. But before that, the railways should work on timings. Let them run a train around 10 am from Banaswadi and 4.30 pm from Hosur and check the ridership,” he said.	Suburban railway,	 Sep 24 2018
‘All potholes in Bengaluru will be filled by today’	by Monday. Speaking to DH, M R Venkatesh, engineer-in-chief, BBMP, said, “We are taking up the work the whole night and will finish the repair.”Asked about the shoddy work and city outskirts not being included in the exercise, Venkatesh said those roads were not being repaired as the BWSSB was laying water pipelines in 110 villages.“About 1,800 km of road is dug up and the repair on these stretches can be taken up only after the BWSSB finishes the project.”Venkatesh said 200 km of roads where the BBMP has taken up white-topping, Tendersure and other projects across the city were also not included.“Since we have diverted traffic to small roads to facilitate these projects, they have suffered damages. We will take up repair work on these roads after the major road projects are done,” he said.Rejecting the complaint of shabby work, he said, “We are filling wet mix to potholes with cement, stones and water along with quarry dust. This is a graded material filled to the base course.”	potholes,	 Sep 24 2018

Polluting SWD a major threat to Agara lake’s ecosystem	of waste is threatening to contaminate the Agara Lake, thanks to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) apathy despite complaints by local residents.As the garbage clogs the drain near the bridge closer to the lake, residents fear that the place –already a rich breeding ground for mosquitoes- would transform into a chief source of vector borne diseases. They also give the place close to the drain a wide birth, assailed by the putrefying odour emerging from the drain’s rotten depths.The trouble started when sewage began flowing into the drain from houses in Bommanahalli and Roopena Agrahara months ago, which officials ignored. The recent rains worsened the situation by choking the inlet with garbage, mostly plastic waste. Activists warned that turning a blind eye to the situation would threaten the lake’s ecosystem. “It has been four years since the rajakaluve (SWD) was de-silted,” said Kavitha Reddy, a Lake Activist and KPCC spokesperson.As sewage continues to flow through the drain, Members of Agara Lake Protection and Management Society (ALPMS) urged the BBMP to clean the SWD, but the civic body did not pay heed, Kavitha said. Activists stacked up sandbags to heighten the lake bund where the sewage water is entering the water body.“This’s not going to stop sewage, but this would at the very least prevent garbage from floating around the lake’s water,” Kavitha said.BBMP officials on the other hand rejected claims that water from the drain is polluting the lake, insisting that periodic de-siltings were taking place throughout the ward.Agara residents complain that the lake’s Kalyani has also been polluted after Ganesha immersions. “BBMP has collected the waste from the lake’s banks but they should do something about water in the Kalyani,” said a resident.

'Rlys must work on auto signalling to run more trains'	"for the suburban railways has also hit the installation of automatic signalling, a cost-effective method to increase the capacity of rail lines for local trains without waiting for Rs 12,000 crore to complete the project. Noting that the SPV has been delayed by one-and-a-half years, urban transport activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar said the state government and the railway should implement the work on a cost-sharing basis without the SPV. ""Automatic signalling costs about Rs 1.15 crore per km and takes a fraction of the time required for building new infrastructure like an elevated railway line. Instead of waiting for an SPV, small projects like this should be taken up on priority,"" he said. Known as Automatic Block Signalling (ABS), the mechanism has proved to be safer than manual signalling and helps to run more trains on a stretch of the railway track which is divided into 'blocks'. The South Western Railway has repeatedly said that the track capacity had been saturated and it would not be possible to introduce more trains. However, the railways told the state government last year that the SPV will install the ABS for three key railway lines from KSR Bengaluru station to Mandya, Tumakuru and Yelahanka. As per the official data, most of the railway lines in Bengaluru have 90% occupancy with the only exception being Chikkaballapur and Mandya (Mysuru) lines. Only 63% of the track capacity is used on the KSR Bengaluru-Yeshwantpur stretch and barely 50% for the Yeshwantpur-Yelahanka and 29% for the Yelahanka-Chikkaballapur. On the other hand, occupancy surges beyond its capacity to 101% on the Baiyappanahalli-Whitefield line. A senior railway official said the SPV would be better equipped to ensure that there are no financial delays. ""The state has delayed payments for various projects and the railways has had to wait for budgetary allocations. The SPV has the capacity to settle such issues quickly,"" the official said. Train to airportSpeaking about the possibility of introducing trains to the airport, a railway official said though the line was clear, congestion at Yeshwantpur station makes it difficult to run trains. ""The morning and evening hours, when the suburban trains will be needed, see peak occupancy in stations due to the arrival/departure of long-distance trains,"" he said."

DH dived deep into these areas to understand the commute struggles.In areas such as R T Nagar, Airport Roads both new and old, Sanjaynagar, Koramangala, Silk Board and other localities, peak hour traffic often brings commuters to a virtual halt. The proximity of arterial roads in these areas to industries and corporate offices makes it worse. Besides the narrow and congested roads, there are no alternatives.Lack of proper transport planning has meant the densely populated residential areas and IT hubs of Bengaluru are not connected by multi-modal commute options. The result: Lakhs of commuters are caught on the road with their productivity and health taking a huge toll.Many techies working in Manyata Tech Park, Electronics City and Whitefield are forced to depend on buses or their own private vehicles. Humungous traffic jams at the Silk Board Junction, for instance, tests the patience of road-users. The promise of a Metro line linking this crowded junction to K R Puram and beyond through the Outer Ring Road (ORR) is yet to get to action mode.Mitali Kulkarni, a software professional staying in HSR Layout, narrates her daily experience: “It takes me almost two hours at times to cover an eight-kilometre distance to Embassy Tech Village. The severe traffic congestion on ORR is the main reason.”She is convinced that the number of employees commuting on this stretch will only increase. “Metro trains should have been up and running here three to four years ago. But I don’t see any plan for it even now. So we, commuters as a community are continuing to spend many unproductive hours, helplessly stuck in traffic,” she says.Many find it hard to digest that the government has paid no attention to address their travel woes despite their long years of struggle. Ajay Bharadwaj, a frequent commuter on Varthur Road says, “This area was nearer to my office. But whenever I wanted to commute to Majestic / City Railway station, it was quite an ordeal to make it on time to catch the bus/train.”On many occasions, Bharadwaj just made it to the trains at the last moment. The heavy traffic congestion on Old Airport Road never gave him any respite. He believes in enhancing Metro connectivity at the earliest.But there are also a number of commuters who do not mind travelling 1-2 kilometres to get to a station. It would be far better than getting stuck endlessly in a traffic jam.Yet, there is no such luck for people residing along Bannerghatta Road. The Metro line planned here is expected to take several years to be commisioned. Says a resident, Ramya Nagaraj: “Bannerghatta road is known for its full-blown traffic. Thousands of commuters struggle on this congested road for hours to reach work places and schools.”The same story repeats in Electronics City, Silk Board Junction and Koramangala, where the only way to get from place to place is the road. Neethu Kashetter talks about the need for alternative options, such as suburban rail and the Metro. That, she says, would make life far easier. If the stations are well connected by last-mile commute options, travelling between work places, commercial centres and schools can get better.	commuters,Bengaluru,traffic,Transport,	 Sep 22 2018
Whitefield citizens to protest poor condition of road	Nallurahalli near Whitefield not improving for many years now, the residents of both the areas will be protesting next week.“The entire length of the road is marked by potholes and there have been no attempts to fill them as yet. There are no footpaths for the pedestrians to walk. Also plenty of illegal road-side encroachments by vendors and junkyard establishments,” said a resident of Siddapura.He added, “With the drastic increase in traffic to and from EPIP and ITPL- the IT corridors in Whitefield area, the current road connecting to these points from Siddapura has turned into a nightmare for regular commuters. The existing road is hardly 15 to 18 feet. Yet many people park illegally across the road.” The road widening project was stopped some years back after some land owners refused to give their land. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike (BBMP) claims that some land owners are refusing to accept the TDR (Transferable Development Rights) and it is taking time to convince them.To raise these demands the residents propose to protest on September 29 from 10 am to 12 noon.	potholes,Whitefield ,road,protest,	 Sep 22 2018

Most waste-to-energy plants idle as BBMP drags its feet	"Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to take up the biomining of quarries filled with waste. But out of the 13 biomethanisation plants, only three are operational as the civic body is dragging its feet over issuing a work order. Biomining involves processing waste to produce energy. In 2016, the BBMP had set up 13 biomethanisation plants to reduce the city's garbage problem. The contracts had been awarded to Mailhem Engineers for three plants and to Ashoka Biogreen for 10 plants. The plants were working well for two years, but the BBMP neither renewed the work orders nor retendered 11 plants after the which the contractors stopped operating them. Gautham, Bengaluru-in-charge of Mailhem Engineers Pvt Ltd, which was managing three plants in Mathikere, Kuvempunagar and Gandhinagar wards, told DH: ""As of now, we are only operating the Kuvempunagar plant and for the other two plants, we have been repeatedly approaching the BBMP to issue the work orders that expired in March 2018. But they have not responded so far."" He continued: ""There is also a payment issue from the BBMP. We have written many letters with regard to payments. If the civic body issues the work order and pays the dues, we are ready to operate the plants."" The biomethanisation plants would convert biodegradable waste into energy and can process five tonnes of wet waste a day, according to the contractors. The energy generated by these plants was used to power up street lights in the area. Additional Commissioner (Administration) BBMP, D Randeep, told this newspaper: ""Most of the biomethanisation plants are not functional in the city except the three. Since these plants have only 60-70% capacity, we are doing a stock-taking exercise to enhance the capacity and utilisation of these plants."" ""I will hold a meeting with officials and managers of the plants to tell them that maximum efforts should go towards sending the waste to the compost and biomethanisation plants,"" he added."	biomethanisation,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,National Green Tribunal,	 Sep 22 2018
Now book daily BMTC passes using smartphones	"ticket facility on Vajra airconditioned buses other than Vayu Vajra, the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has gone a step ahead and allowed commuters book daily passes using smartphones and pay using digital wallet apps. The state-run corporation has partnered with IIMB-NSRCEL incubated tech start-up Series-5 Labs to launch the BMTC Namma pass. According to an official release, commuters need not download any mobile app to book daily passes instead visit www.nammapass.series-5.com/and enter personal details and upload a selfie.

Trucks dumping trash in lakes seized; owner booked	against trucks dumping garbage onto the lake bed in Anugondanahalli village at the outskirts of Southeast Bengaluru. Operating for garbage contractors within the city they have been dumping filth into the Medimallasandra lake bed for the past four to five months, the police say.“As residents are not coming forward to lodge complaints fearing the garbage mafia, we have taken suo-motu complaints to curb this menace,” said a senior police officer.The police have registered two cases against the owners of three trucks, who are garbage contractors in the city, and their drivers. Receiving complaints from nearby residents that trucks loaded with garbage moved towards the lake at different times, the police confronted them in the act and seized the vehicles along with the leftover garbage.“We were told the trucks use the Anugondahalli village route and head towards Doddaballapura where there is a dump yard. However to make some quick bucks the drivers cut their journeys short and dump the garbage in such secluded places,” the officer said quoting the truck owners who pleaded ignorance and blamed their drivers.The Anugondanahalli police of the Thirumalashettihalli circle are patrolling intensely around the lake all day round to prevent the trucks from entering the lake premise.“We have also written letters to Panchayat Development Office (PDO) Anugondanahalli about this, but the officials are not addressing the issue. So we have intensified the patrolling and seizing the trucks ourselves,” the senior police officer said.	Garbage,	 Sep 22 2018
OK to dump sewage anywhere: BWSSB staff	over the apathetic approach of civic bodies towards cleaning up lakes in the city. But for sanitary workers of the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), it is “normal practice” to dispose of untreated sewage wherever they please.At least that is what two sanitary workers did near Hosmat hospital on Wednesday. They were caught red-handed by research associate Lakshmikantha of the Namma Bengaluru Foundation.The driver of the jetting machine vehicle and the sanitary worker are seen blatantly saying in the video that “disposing of untreated sewage anywhere is normal practice”. On Lakshmikantha’s Twitter handle, many commented about raw sewage being disposed of in many locations, including the lakes in Bengaluru. Dinakar, in-charge, engineer, BWSSB, said the workers should ideally dispose of sewage in a nearby manhole that is functioning well, and that if only silt is collected, it has to be taken to BWSSB’s designated dump yard near Bommanahalli.The Namma Bengaluru Foundation is most likely to file a complaint with the police and also inform the NGT.The NGT, in its April 2017 order, had clearly stated that “If anybody is found to be dumping waste of any kind either in the lake or in the buffer zone, he shall be liable to pay an environmental compensation of Rs 5 lakh per event.”BWSSB chairperson Tushar Giri Nath squarely blamed the sanitary workers for the “blunder”.“Ideally, they should have disposed of the sanitary waste in a manhole which is working fine or the nearest sewage treatment plant. We are going to educate our sanitary workers on how to dispose of untreated sewage and also brief our engineers to monitor the same,” he said.	BWSSB,	 Sep 22 2018
Church St. cobblestones loosen twice in 6 months	on the renovated Church Street are coming loose. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has identified about five to six ‘bad patches’ along the street where cobblestones have got dislodged, and the civic body has begun repairing them by strengthening the base.A BBMP worker who was repairing cobblestones near Indian Coffee House on Friday afternoon said they were replacing the cobblestone after strengthening them with cement in the same place. He said heavy traffic was one of the reasons why they were coming loose.Lokesh, executive engineer, TenderSURE project, BBMP said officials are closely monitoring the work. “A total of 2.5 lakh cobblestones have been laid on the street. Since this is still in the defect liability period, we are asking the contractors to do the work,” said Lokesh. K T Nagaraj, chief engineer, road infrastructure, (projects), BBMP said pouring water on the street is also another reason for this problem. “A house near the Rest House Road junction is using a hosepipe to pour water on the street. This has become a huge problem,” he said.Nagaraj said they will soon lodge a police complaint against this menace. “We have sent a notice to the resident,” he said. The Church Street remodelling project under TenderSURE has cost the civic body Rs 14 crore and was inaugurated in March this year by former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. The project was earlier scheduled to have been completed by August 2017.	Church Street,	 Sep 21 2018
Dy CM: Most arterial roads to be white-topped	on Friday that all arterial roads in the city will be white-topped in five years.He told reporters that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has taken up the work of filling potholes after directions from the high court. As of now, the civic body is white-topping only a few identified arterial roads.When questioned about BBMP's shoddy job of filling potholes to meet the deadline, Parameshwara said, “I agree that the quality is being compromised. But the BBMP will take up asphalting work once the rains subside,” Parameshwara said.Meanwhile, Mayor R Sampath Raj also inspected the ongoing pothole work on Wood Street in Shantinagar, Lalbagh Road and at HAL 2nd Stage.According to BBMP, 517 potholes have been filled since 7.30 pm on Thursday till 7.30 pm on Friday and there are 1,655 potholes remaining.

Lalbagh lake gets colourful with water lily plants	rejuvenate the lake in Lalbagh and beautify the waterbody with the idea of drawing more visitors. “We have introduced nymphaea plants, instead of lotus. This is the first time we have done it and it is showing results,” said M Jagadeesh, Joint Director, Horticulture Department, Lalbagh. Nymphaeas (water lilies) are preferred over lotus because they are less vigorous and easy to maintain. Over 150 plants of 40 varieties in five different colours will be introduced into the lake. The Department began introducing Nymphaeas two months ago and will continue with the project for another couple of months. Visitors to the garden will find the lake resplendent with the colourful plants, which were grown in the Department’s nurseries. Even as it enhances the lake’s beauty, the Department is also setting up a viewing deck on the lines of Mandya’s Gaganachukki waterfalls. Jagadeesh said the 20 feet tall and 15 feet wide viewing deck is made near the bridge and retention wall of the lakes. Putting up a tall viewing deck is also to allow visitors the glimpse of the area’s biodiversity, especially of the wetlands surrounding the waters. The wetland is home to several bird species that include the migratory variety seen roosting there most times of the year. The department is also planning to install a telescope on the deck for better viewing and is in discussions on where to get one.	Lake,water lilies,Lalbagh,Horticulture Department,	 Sep 21 2018
Commuters battle road rollers amidst peak hour jams	dream. But the dream turned into a nightmare on Friday morning, when road-rollers and contractors were blocking prime intersections in the city in a bid to fill the potholes, adding to the traffic snarls.“I understand that the BBMP is supposed to follow the court orders and repair the roads. But the timing is putting us in trouble. Because they did not do their work in the past in a planned manner, the public has to face the brunt now. Also, how much will this patchwork help in giving us smooth roads?” Nagaraj, a motorist said.The intersection on Hosur Main Road was one of the busy roads that were chosen for repair during the peak hours of Friday morning. However, a road-roller and contractors along with workers running around to fill potholes in the middle of the main road added up to the chaos.“The traffic police have a tough time managing the traffic here even on normal days. The BMTC buses and vehicles are out of control, especially at this time. The BBMP is more than welcome to repair the roads. But they should not add to our peak hour troubles,” Aishwarya Shankar, an artist said.Citizens also felt that the work taken up in a hurry to meet a deadline would not last and would also do more harm than help.“I am sceptical if these patches will withstand even one spell of rain. For the sake of it, the work will be done in a sub-standard manner, and one shower will bring these roads back to square one. It’s like we have to choose between pothole-free road or no extra trouble during the peak hours” Aishwarya added.However, the BBMP requested people to be patient. Venkatesh M R, the Engineer in Chief, BBMP, called for co-operation from the public for better roads.“The BBMP is working in the interest of the public. We are doing our best to provide better roads and request the public to cooperate,” Venkatesh said.He promised that the BBMP would take care of the work during the peak hours accordingly and added that the work done round the clock was to repair the potholes instantly.“Peak hours or no peak hours, the BBMP has to attend to all the potholes instantly. We have to comply with the court as well. We are also taking the help of the contractors to reach the deadline,” he explained.	potholes,Bengaluru,BBMP,	 Sep 21 2018
BBMP yet to set up micro ward SWM	the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for poor Solid Waste Management (SWM) in the city, it is yet to set up the proposed micro plants in the city. The BBMP, along with the existing ward committees, had planned to start one SWM plant in each ward to treat 15 tonnes of garbage each day. “The initiative which was to be implemented by now has not taken any shape yet. The BBMP SWM micro plant was to execute segregation-at-source and composting of waste,” said N S Ramakanth, member, SWM Expert Committee.The decision to set them up in all the 198 wards of the city was taken after the court took it to task while hearing a ward committee petition on SWM. “According to the plan one auto tipper would collect segregated garbage from 750 houses in a ward and send it to the micro plant to process it. But so far the authorities have made no effort to set up these plants. The initiative is still pending in front of the BBMP council,” he added.The action plan prepared by the BBMP mandated that the ward committees will be led by the council member, who is also the chairman of the particular ward committee. Members of the committee will monitor the SWM in that ward.An official from BBMP said, “We are in the process of setting up SWM micro plants in all the wards. The council needs to clear the file.”	Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike,Karnataka High Court,BBMP,Solid Waste Management,	 Sep 21 2018
Projects held up as state, railways fail to coordinate	has delayed several rail works in the state, from big-ticket projects like the Kolar Coach Factory to new railway lines and even road overbridges. The issue came to the fore in the replies given by the railways to MPs from constituencies that fall in the Bengaluru division of the South Western Railway (SWR) on Tuesday. As delays continue to escalate the costs, activists fear that will finally lead to the shelving of the project. For example, the 53-km Whitefield-Kolar line should have been completed by now.Though the railways gave details of the land required for the project, the government hasn’t yet started the acquisition process, officials told MPs. During the meeting, Chikkaballapur MP M Veerappa Moily enquired about the status of the NES underpass near the Yelahanka station. The railways told him that the BBMP had deposited just Rs 12.58 lakh as against the requirement of Rs 8.03 crore. Tumkur MP, S P Muddahanumegowda, demanded the expedition of work on the Tumakuru-Rayadurga new line and other doubling works.He was told that land acquisition was pending in Tumakuru district for the Rayadurga line while the doubling of the Arsikere-Karadi (36 km) line was in the planning stage. The Kolar line, along with the proposed new line between Bangarpet and Mulbagal which has been put on the backburner, is important if the state government wants to realise the dream of decongesting Bengaluru by developing satellite towns. There were, however, some positive takeaways from the meeting as the railways promised to start the first phase of the Baiyappanahalli coaching terminal by March 2019. The railways also responded positively to the proposed construction of a halt station at Doddanekkundi, which will play a major role as part of the suburban rail network. The much-awaited doubling of Baiyappanahalli–Hosur (48 km) and Yeshwantpur-Channasandra (22 km) lines will start shortly as the SWR is set to invite tender by the end of this month. Suburban rail DPR by November The detailed project report on the 161-km suburban railway network for Bengaluru would be completed by November. The railways will get a preliminary report by the end of September, SWR General Manager A K Gupta said. The state government told the railways that the Karnataka Railway Infrastructure Development Corporation (K-RIDE) is being reorganised to make it part of the special purpose vehicle in which the state and Centre will have an equal share. Govt delaying suburban rail: BJP MP The meeting saw Bangalore Central parliamentarian P C Mohan lashing out at the state government for “delaying” the suburban rail project although the railways went the extra mile by agreeing to bear half of the cost. “Urban transport is a state subject and the railways has taken initiatives to introduce 26 local trains and agreed to increase its share in the project from 20% to 50%. But the state government is not showing any interest,” he said. Railway officials said the MPs promised to meet Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy to urge him to form a special purpose vehicle at the earliest. “The railways has already sanctioned the project. The state government is focused more on its survival than taking up works that benefit the people,” Mohan said.	Bengaluru suburban rail,	 Sep 19 2018
MP asks locals to file complaint against Graphite India	nearby Graphite India Limited (GIL) to file criminal complaint against the company they have been fighting for the last 20 years.Local people have been complaining that the excessive soot emanated by the factory affects their health and creates air pollution.As per the air quality data captured by AirCare- a community-developed air quality monitoring network, PM2.5 (fine particles with a size of 2.5 microns and less measured in micrograms in a cubic meter) is more at Graphite junction.Following complaints by local residents, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in 1998 called for a joint meeting with GIL and directed the factory to install pollution control measures as per Central Pollution Control Board guidelines and replace all machinery. As GIL didn’t follow it, the KSPCB issued a notice and closure order in 2012.But GIL obtained a stay order on the closure notice in 2012. The residents intervened and challenged the stay order and requested the Appellate court to uphold the closure. In 2014, after many hearings, the Appellate court upheld the stay order and allowed GIL to continue operations.The residents challenged the order in National Green Tribunal (NGT). As per the case, the KSPCB inspected the GIL premises in 2017 and the report it submitted indicated that the company did not complete orders by the appellate court. The NGT is yet to make a ruling as the judges on the tribunal benches have retired.GIL’s license ended in June 2018 and KSPCB chairman Lakshman, who was part of Tuesday’s hearing, said the Board will not renew it.MP PC Mohan urged the locals to file a criminal complaint since the company is functioning without license. GIL representatives argued that they are following the NGT orders and their company is not responsible for the pollution in Whitefield. Lakshman said he will personally inspect GIL on Wednesday with his Board members. “The KSPCB will ensure continuous air check from hereafter. We’ll go to the court and strength the case with all documents and technical data. We’ll await court order on the factory’s closure,” he added.	Graphite India Ltd,	 Sep 19 2018
Wilson Garden residents oppose white-topping	Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP)'s white topping work on Tuesday stating that it is not suitable for their vehicles and it will also deplete the ground water.“The white topping project is not suitable for the motorists. The tyres of our vehicles are not designed for concrete roads. They want to lay a white topping on this bad road but it will only harm the road further and will also deplete the ground water,” said Arun Prasad, a protestor.About 50 residents had gathered at the 10th cross, near the Rajkumar statue in Wilson Garden to protest. They also complained against the poor condition of roads and incomplete drainage work in the locality.“We have lodged several complaints with the BBMP to repair these pothole-filled roads since February this year but it has all fallen on deaf ears. Ever since the election work began in the city, all the civic works have come to a halt and we residents are bearing the brunt of it. With the metal railing popping out the open drainage near Agadi Hospital is posing a threat to commuters,” he further added.N Muniyappa, a resident of the locality said that the condition of the road on 10th main, 11th cross at Hombegowda Nagar has deteriorated since the last two years.The residents were accompanied by the members of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and also the Republic Party of India (RPI). The residents also propose to submit a letter to the BBMP Commissioner.	Wilson Garden,	 Sep 18 2018
Residents fume over Bellandur skywalk snail's pace work	Outer Ring Road near Belllandur in Bengaluru East is yet to be open for the public.The resident welfare associations (RWAs) have slammed the inordinate delay in executing the project and exerted pressure on the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to expedite work.The skywalk between Akme Harmony Apartments and Cloudnine Hospital is built based on Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) model.Last year in December, the RWAs under the banner of ‘Bellandur Jothege’ conceived and participated in city’s first community-sourced pedestrianisation programme called ‘Bellandur walks’. Developing better footpaths, adding skywalks and pelican signals were some of the goals of this initiative.They staged a massive protest against the BBMP in December demanding this particular skywalk in Bellandur. The RWAs claimed that the presence of flyovers in the locality had bestowed a luxury of rash driving, which was making it impossible for the pedestrians to cross the road.The BBMP called for tenders on January 17 after the mayor sanctioned the project in December, last year. But the construction work kick-started only in March.The residents urged the BBMP to expedite the construction work pointing out the rise in the number of accident cases in the recent days.“Other than the Sanjaygiri skywalk opposite to Akme Harmony apartments, no skywalks have been built in this highly populous suburb which has an average footfall of 45,000 as many corporate offices and factories are situated here,” said Kishori Mudaliar, a spokesperson of Bellandur Jothege and Bellandur Walks.“The pedestrian toll in Bellandur alone is five in eight months. The BBMP should pay a heed at least now,” he added.Asha Suresh, Bellandur corporator told DH: “This year’s Assembly election had put a brake on the work. From the day poll code came into effect, the work was stopped for about 20 days. Hence, the delay.” She also mentioned heavy traffic as another reason for the delay.She said: “As the traffic is heavy during the daytime, most of the work was carried out during the night time.”“The required construction materials are at the site now. We are going to erect the staircase in the next 10 days. We will assure the completion of entire skywalk in 30 days from today.”	Belllandur,skywalk,Outer Ring Road,	 Sep 17 2018
Kengeri Lake still waits for second shot at life	"some more time to get a new lease of life. Several months after the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) picked a contractor to revive the western Bengaluru lake, there is little or no activity on the ground. There is no semblance of a waterbody. All that exists is a vast spread of weeds, shrubs, bushes, garbage and debris. The 32-acre, 16-gunta lake, also known as Doddakere, is located in the Vrishabhavathi river basin opposite the Kengeri Satellite Town bus station on Mysuru Road in Bengaluru South taluk. The lake was last developed by the forest department in 2005. The department developed islands, pathways and fenced the lake. But poor maintenance over the past years pushed the lake back to square one. The fence is now broken. In 2012, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) handed over the lake to the BMRCL, which showed interest in developing the waterbody as part of its corporate social responsibility. The BMRCL is building two metro stations in the vicinity of the lake. The agency is to develop, restore, maintain and beautify the lake. It plans to build walking paths, a children's play area, a recreation zone, an islet, boating and other facilities. The BMRCL called tenders in June 2017 for rejuvenating the lake, but could not go ahead with the project, owing to encroachments and stringent conditions laid down by the now-defunct Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority. It succeeded only after the third tender and awarded the project to MR Protech Pvt Ltd for Rs 7 crore. BMRCL spokesperson U A Vasanth Rao said the work would start by the end of September. But the delay has hit people hard. People waiting for buses have converted the lakebed into an open urinal. Pushpa, a commuter, complained: ""Vendors have put up pushcarts near the lake and throw leftovers and waste into it. It's embarrassing for women to see men urinate without any inhibition near the lake."" Manjunatha K, a local resident, said: ""Once a beautiful lake, it's now full of weeds and water hyacinth. It stinks badly."""	Kengeri Lake,BMRCL,	 Sep 17 2018
BMTC proposal to lease 500 electric buses on backburner	"which it has described as a raw deal, has put the plan to lease 500 more such buses under a state-funded programme in abeyance.In its last budget, the Siddaramaiah government had assured financial aid to the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) for leasing 1,000 buses. Following the ""cut-price"" offer made by a private company for a previous tender to lease 80 electric buses under a Central scheme, the BMTC board had cleared a proposal to lease 500 such buses three months ago.However, transport minister D C Thammanna has described the lease price quoted by the private player (Rs 24 per km for non-AC bus and Rs 37.45 per km for AC bus) as a ""raw deal"" that needs to be renegotiated.With the corporation set to scrap 1,298 buses that have clocked over 8.5 lakh km by the end of 2018, the delay in the addition of new buses is likely to hit its operations.BMTC managing director V Ponnuraj, who had earlier described the deal as a cost-effective method in testing new technology, refused to comment on the delay in leasing the buses.But sources said it is unlikely that the BMTC would get a better offer. ""We have got the best offer (for leasing 80 buses) at a time when Telangana and Maharashtra are ready to pay more. The tender documents for 500 buses were prepared after we realised that leasing buses will save us more than Rs 10 per km, besides reducing pollution. It was cleared by the previous board three months ago and sent to the minister for approval,"" a source told DH.The minister had previously confirmed that he was holding the files in order to ""ensure that BMTC gets the best offer"". To a question on the delay in the introduction of electric buses at a time when soaring fuel prices were causing losses, he said rushing through the deal would set a ""wrong precedent"" and suggested that the corporation can buy buses instead of leasing them.""The electric bus has no manufacturer in India and BMTC doesn't have any experience in handling that technology. The lease model was not only cheap, but also a strategic move considering that the private operator will take all the risks,"" a source in the government said."	BMTC,electric bus,	 Sep 17 2018
Suburban rail works hit; govt fails to give Binny land	"suburban trains have been put on the backburner, as the Karnataka government is sitting on the railways' request for land for creating additional infrastructure. Following the government's demand for local trains, the South Western Railway (SWR) sought 10 acres of the Binny Mills land next to the Krantivira Sangolli Rayanna railway station in 2012. In January 2017, the government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the suburban rail project, which included a facility to maintain MEMU trains at Banaswadi. The railways sought 40 acres belonging to the NGEF for building the maintenance shed. Railway officials say they have not heard from the government on either land. ""We have not received any communication from the government on facilitating the acquisition of land in both the places,"" R S Saxena, Divisional Railway Manager, Bengaluru, told DH. He said the railways had been running around 100 suburban services with the limited infrastructure and that the introduction of any more services would affect long-distance passenger and freight trains. As per the minutes of a meeting held in August 2017, the government told the railways that acquiring the Binny Mills land, estimated to cost more than Rs 60 crore, would not be feasible. ""We were not consulted before its feasibility was decided. Any suburban network will not be complete without decongesting the KSR station,"" a source in the SWR said. To a question on cost-sharing, the source said such discussions would follow only after the government responded positively to the proposal. ""In 2012, it was the government that suggested we acquire the land. Now, it says that's not feasible,"" he said. Urban transport activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar said acquiring the Binny Mills land was crucial for adding platforms and that the matter had been discussed for almost a decade now. ""Any more delay will directly affect the suburban project and limit the introduction of new long-distance trains. It also affects proposed projects like the Chennai-Mysuru high-speed rail,"" he added. Last year, the government told the railways the NGEF land was ""not encumbrance-free"" as a German company has a 10% stake in the factory. ""Even after the Centre sanctioned Rs 29.5 crore for the project, we are yet to get the land. Now, they are telling us to look for alternative land in Whitefield,"" the source in the railways said."	railway projects,Binny Mills land,	 Sep 17 2018
Bhindi seeds can purify water… say these students	"water is as easy as buying a few grams of bhindi or okra. Improbable as it seems, okra seeds can help bring down the turbidity of water and reduce contamination, the students have found.The three students, from the CMRIT College, have shown through experiments that water can be purified at the initial stage.They first mixed water with soil and used it as sample for their experiment. The collection of water samples was used in a two-three week period and stored at temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, using refrigeration.They collected two different samples of about 40 litres and recorded their raw characteristics. After drying the bhindi seeds, they used them in the powder form to purify the water.""We went through various research papers to ascertain that this is possible,"" said Shivi Shandilya, who worked on the experiment with Shreesh and Rohith N. ""Given that water purification is expensive now, this would help eliminate some amount of particulate matter,"" he said.One of the processes of water treatment is coagulation. In water treatment, coagulation occurs when a coagulant is added to water to ""destabilise"" colloidal suspensions.""Coagulation is one of the cheapest processes for treatment of various organic effluents,"" one of the students said.They believe okra (Abelmoschus Esculentus) is a natural coagulant that works as a cost-effective solution."	okra seeds,water purification,	 Sep 17 2018
High-tension wires above Rajajinagar park poses danger	"which attracts the public in large numbers, is posing a grave danger to the users. A high-tension power transmission wire runs right above the BBMP-maintained Dr B R Ambedkar playground in the Dr Rajkumar ward, which could harm nearly a hundred children in the locality in the wake of an accident. ""The playground is well-maintained, but we are scared of the high-tension wires, which is a threat,"" said Prakash Rao, a resident of Basaveshwaranagar. ""We urge the authorities to shift the lines away from the park."" Developed near Rajajinagar 5th Block, the joggers' park is located right under the high-tension transmission towers. This reporter saw no barricades to the towers, and the danger sign to warn the public was also missing. ""The park was developed just three years ago, before which there were only these transmission towers,"" said Miral Jain, who lives nearby. ""Senior citizens visiting the park are avoiding it, especially after the rain."" Roopa R, the corporator of ward number 106 (Dr Rajkumar ward), told DH that a proposal had been mooted to remove the high-tension line in the wake of the threat it poses to the public.Hundreds of children play in the park every day."	power transmission wires,Rajajinagar,high-tension wires,joggers' park,	 Sep 17 2018
KSPCB checking STPs in apts around Hebbal, K&C valleys 	"lakes, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) is now checking ones around Hebbal and Kommaghatta and Challaghatta (K&C) valleys.The board is checking installation and usage of sewage treatment plants (STPs) and has begun slapping notices to apartment complexes. Nearly 50 of them located around the Byaramanagala Lake and Hebbal Valley have received notices.""The apartment dwellers have been asked to attend personally and represent their case. We are checking on those who do not have STPs, those operating without consent and those who didn't renew their STP licences,"" KSPCB chairman Lakshman told DH. The board has given them three to six months' time to comply with the directions. The hearing started a week ago and each apartment complex is being given a time slot to present their case.Reasons for non-compliance include lack of funds, space constraints and fewer occupants.He said that unlike industries or commercial units, closure orders cannot be issued to apartment complexes. But as per the rules, directions can be issued to disconnect their electricity supply and water connection.""We haven't asked Bescom to snap electricity connections so far, but will be forced to do so if the apartments do not comply with the orders and stick to the given time frame,"" Lakshman added.KSPCB is following the National Green Tribunal directions that untreated sewage should not be allowed into the waterbodies. Notices are also served under section 33 (A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.It is also surveying apartments around K&C Valley. The board has also issued instructions to the electroplating and heavy metal industries and other commercial units in the Peenya Industrial Area and around Byramangala Lake to ensure appropriate usage of the STPs.Lakshman said the board is taking into account the use of common effluent treatment plants as several small-scale industries function in the Byramangala Lake and K&C Valley areas.It also regularly monitors the methods adopted to discharge their effluents, while those directly allowing the waste water into the lake will be severely dealt with."

App-based, exclusive office commute cabs enter city	home to office and back, without surge-pricing or the unpredictability of commute time associated with Ola or Uber. Companies in Bengaluru are now switching to this model, offering employees the option as an incentive.Here’s how it works: the app for employees helps him/her book the cab, track it and offer feedback. The driver app gets information on all his trips with a paperless billing process. The billing model differs with companies, although most firms prefer to do it at the end of every month.A key player in this emerging market, Routematic has entered Bengaluru with a three-level internal technology automation solution for a company’s transport team, employees and drivers.“The average commute time from home to office in the city is 55-60 minutes one way. Employers are now offering app-based commute as a perk, something that is available 24/7,” says Routematic co-founder Surajit Das. Ola and Uber might have revolutionised point-to-point commute. Office-goers had switched to this, dumping their personal vehicles. However, surge-pricing, unavailability of these cabs during rains and waiting issues with shared taxis forced employees to look elsewhere.But arranging an office cab meant a complicated process that required documentation, multiple emails and paperwork. “Route automation changed that,” notes Das. “On clicking a button, our app throws up the most optimal routes. Automated tripsheets are delivered to the drivers.”Drivers, just as in the app-based taxi aggregators, own the vehicle. The vast majority, about 70 to 70%, are sedans and hatchbacks. SUVs constitute 13-14%, while 7-8% are made up by 12-17 seaters. “Drivers are guaranteed minimum fares and customers. Suppose an employee is dropped from Electronics City to Hebbal, our network ensures that the return trip is occupied,” Das explains.Presence in Pune Having established itself in Pune, Routematic entered Bengaluru three months ago. With more players emerging in this nascent market, tying up with more companies, the number of private vehicles in the office-home routes could see a dip.Routematic alone has proposed to increase its fleet of vehicles to 2,000 by December 2019.Safety of women passengers has been a big concern. The new platform introduced a set of new features to make it foolproof: women passenger car hot-tracking, safe drop confirmation and a call-masking feature, besides a panic button to trigger emergence response from a company’s transport team.

BBMP stares at revenue deficit plans 	to take off, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike is once again staring at a deficit year.In the 2018-19 fiscal year, the civic body has set a revenue target of Rs 9,322.48 crore accrued through sources like property tax, non-tax revenue, government grants, recovery and refunds.However, a majority of the BBMP’s plans to augment revenue through non-tax measures such as levying entertainment tax, enhancing penalty on authorised optic fiber cable firms, and collecting betterment charges from B-khata properties have not materialised so far.The total station survey by the BBMP’s Standing Committee on Tax and Finance also flopped as the civic body missed out on collecting penalty from those who undervalued their properties. The BBMP was also planning to levy Rs 50,000 for every mobile tower on private land.It recently proposed to levy a ‘Land Transport Cess’ on property owners to boost revenue, but the subject did not even come up for discussion at the BBMP council.“If the state government grants us permission to implement these measures, we will work on improving our revenue collection,” said BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad.However, the BBMP is working hard to achieve its property tax targets since last year. BBMP sources said the shortfall will make it tougher for the civic body to fund the budget projects.This did not deter the Palike from drawing up action plans to implement the budget plans, a move that would result in mounting contractor bills. The civic body currently has outstanding contractor bills up to a whopping Rs 15,462 crore. This is why the BBMP commissioner has asked the state government to bring the civic body under the ambit of the Karnataka Local Fund Authorities and Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2003, and restore financial discipline, sources pointed out.Proposed meaures to boost revenue	revenue deficit,BBMP,	 Sep 15 2018
Lokayukta probes pollution in Yele Mallappa Chetty Lake	"on the alleged encroachment and release of industrial waste into the Yele Mallappa Chetty Lake in Seegehalli and Medahalli villages on Old Madras Road.The lake is spread over 473.22 acres.Based on an anonymous complaint, Lokayukta Justice P Vishwanath Shetty directed the ADGP-Lokayukta to ask the Lokayukta police to investigate the matter. Based on their report, Assistant Registrar (Legal Opinion), Lokayukta, placed a scrutiny note.The Lokayukta has asked the officials to submit a report on whether the lake has been encroached by the public and polluted substance is dumped into the waterbody, leading to its contamination.The notice has been issued to the BBMP commissioner; member secretary, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board; deputy commissioner (Bengaluru Urban); chairman, BWSSB; and chief executive officer of zilla panchayat (Bengaluru Urban).

Work near Doddanekundi flyover delayed	"a flyover at Doddanekundi is getting delayed endlessly. Although the flyover is open for public use, the ongoing work under the structure has turned into a nightmare for commuters.In the aftermath of Friday's rain, the road below the flyover has turned pathetic, leaving vehicles stranded for hours.Bengaluru Development Minister G Parameshwara, who inspected the flyover construction work two months ago, had promised that work at the flyover, including drainage and construction of footpaths on both sides, would be over by September 15. Work on the drains is still dragging on. Residents of Doddanekkundi complained of poor coordination between the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) and the Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA) in carrying out the flyover work. ""The BDA started the work three years ago. And September 15 was the latest commitment given by the BDA commissioner to the citizens, but it is yet to be completed. The ground-level BDA engineers are incompetent and have kept the contractors' payments pending. Residents have lost hope on the BDA and only wish they complete this project at the earliest,"" said Clement Jayakumar, a resident of Doddanekundi.Another resident added: ""Since the road is completely water-logged due to the ongoing drainage and footpath work, we are not able to use it. We are using an alternative road, which is adjacent to the main road for now.""""We cannot start work unless the BWSSB completes its work. The civic body is currently shifting 200-300 mm diameter water and sewerage pipelines there. They might take another five days to complete it. We will kick-start our work soon after that and finish the entire work in a month,"" said Ramesh T H, assistant executive engineer, BDA."	BDA,Doddanekundi flyover,BWSSB,	 Sep 15 2018
Accidents on the rise on pothole-ridden Tumakuru Rd	"of Tumakuru Road, motorists are having a harrowing time driving on it.It has become a nightmare for motorists as they fear accidents owing to these potholes. It is particularly difficult for two-wheeler riders.""I witnessed an accident recently when a biker with a pillion rider fell down to avoid large potholes. Fortunately, they escaped unhurt as there was no vehicle behind them. It is almost two months now, but the authorities concerned are not bothered to repair the road,"" said Praveen Kumar, a commuter.The stretch near Goraguntepalya is, particularly, in bad shape. Another commuter blames private buses and trucks for driving recklessly on the stretch.Shankar Gowda, a commuter from Peenya, said: ""The road has been damaged because of heavy transport vehicles (HTVs) plying on this stretch. During the night, two-wheeler riders cannot ride here as the private buses drive recklessly and it is very dangerous. The rainfall has also damaged the road."" ""The traffic police should make sure that these buses and heavy vehicles drive at a regulated speed along the road. The BBMP also has to fill the potholes and repair the road as soon as it is damaged,"" he added.There have been several accidents, according to the traffic police. ""Last week, there was an accident because of these potholes. On an average, there are five to 10 accidents in a month only due to the poor condition of the road,"" said a traffic police official from the Yeswanthpur station.They also claimed that they have approached the civic authorities, but nothing has come out of it yet. ""We have written three letters so far to repair the road, but the BBMP has not done anything so far,"" he said.The civic body officials, for their part, said they have been doing their bit to repair the roads.

BBMP slow in collecting data for Swachh Survekshan 2019	began on September 1, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is yet to kick-start the process.Much of the delay is due to lack of infrastructure.The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) guidelines mandate every participating city to provide daily updates on its performance across several categories.For instance, local bodies must input information (online) on collection –both primary and secondary-, transport and process of garbage on a daily basis.Nearly a week and a half after the data collection began, the BBMP is only now starting off with the process to create the Programme Management Unit (PMU) to provide the daily update, including a dedicated set-up to document and validate data.“We’ve had initial rounds of meetings,” said Randeep D, BBMP’s special commissioner for Solid Waste Management. “We’ll set-up the PMU and deploy full-time staff to do the data validation.”The unit would have SWM experts, environmentalists and even data entry operators, he added. He said the civic body would build on the data collected by the war room set-up during last year’s Swachh Survekshan survey. But the BBMP must validate much of the primary data gathered back then.“The health department had issued licenses for several commercial establishments to function. But the data on how many of those units are paying commercial tax is yet to be validated,” Randeep pointed out, adding that those discrepancies will be fixed this time for a better rating.Some SWM experts are concerned about the star rating system introduced from this year in the place of rankings, wondering if Bengaluru can manage even a single star. One of them, V Ramprasad, averred: “The city has a monumental task.”“The MoHUA guidelines have laid Segregation at source, cleaning of stormwater drains and scientific waste processing as some of the basic criteria to get the first star. We’re behind in most of them,” he added.	Swachh Survekshan 2019,	 Sep 13 2018
BDA seeks aid from BBMP, says needs Rs 6,000 crore	from Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and other government agencies, saying the fund’s crunch could jeopardise some of its projects.At the last BDA board meeting, chaired by Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara, the financial crisis of BDA was tabled and discussed. The BDA officials proposed to the government and the agencies seeking their help.“We have told the government that we need Rs 6,000 crore to execute all the works. We need Rs 4,500 crore alone to execute new projects. But the question is how to raise the money? While the government has proposed to undertake projects on a partnership basis, the fact is, executing our own ongoing projects is a problem,” sources in the BDA told DH. By selling corner sites in various layouts and available land parcels across the city, the BDA has estimated that it will earn not more than Rs 2,000 crore. But there is a need for Rs 3,200 crore to develop Kempegowda Layout alone and to execute the housing project approved by the BDA Board.There is a need for an additional Rs 2,800 crore to execute infrastructure projects across the city like road widening and flyover works.Thus, the BDA has requested the BBMP to help, the source said.If it fails to get the aid, BDA has planned to put some of its works on the back burner. This list includes re-development of commercial complexes like Jayanagar and Koramangala; and rejuvenation of parks and lakes, as BDA is unable to improve and maintain them. BDA is also contemplating holding back some of its housing projects. The authority has also planned to hold back some infrastructure works like the widening of Hebbal flyover and Hennur flyover.“We have estimated that around Rs 55 crore is needed for the Jayanagar complex alone. We have spent Rs 140 crore on the rejuvenation of lakes but are unable to maintain them. Somebody has to come forward.The BDA pointed out to the government that it should focus on developing layouts and ensuring infrastructure is completed there,” BDA officials told the government representatives.

Scientist gives BBMP quick-fix solution for potholes	"potholes on major stretches could be passe, as a scientist has offered a quick-fix solution.'Kandhal mix' — a ready-to-use cold asphalt mix formulated by Prithvi Singh Kandhal, former professor of the National Centre for Asphalt Technology, Auburn University — comes with the advantage of not having to wait for it to set before being thrown open to vehicles.Top sources in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) confirmed that this would be procured in small quantities and used on a pilot basis.Conducting a demonstration at the Indian Institute of Science following a workshop on pothole solutions, Kandhal said he was willing to offer the formula to the Palike free of cost.Available in 50 kg packs, the concrete mix is poured into potholes and set using a hand-rammer. Put a layer of sand or dry leaves on the mix, and vehicles are ready to go. ""The more the number of vehicles that pass over the mix, the better it sets in,"" said Kandhal.The BBMP is presently using cold mix to asphalt roads in emergency conditions. However, vehicular movement is restricted until the asphalt sets. While the Palike resorts to mixing materials at site, Kandhal mix comes in ready-to-use packets.In the bitumen emulsion and aggregate mix that is currently being used, the setting time may mean several hours depending on weather conditions. ""Once the rain stops, the surface is cleaned and potholes filled. The mix is prepared in situ,"" said S Somashekar, chief engineer, road infrastructure, BBMP.Cost-effectiveWhile the hot mix is manufactured in large quantities to fill potholes, the Kandhal mix could be used in small quantities as it is available in packs. Its production cost is Rs 6 a kilo. Currently, the mix is being used in parts of Jaipur.The professor also said the mixture can be laid on potholes just one hour after the rain. ""One common reason authorities give for not fixing potholes is rain. This is foolproof even that way. Once the rain stops, an hour's gap is all that's needed for work to commence,"" he said."

HC wants details of 1,880 hoardings still left in city	submit details of the 1,880 illegal hoardings and structures that have not been removed by their owners despite being served notices by the civic body. The counsel for the BBMP told the court that 1,987 illegal hoardings still existed in the city and that their owners hadn’t responded to notices so far.But 107 of these hoardings were voluntarily removed by their owners. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari was hearing a PIL petition for removal of illegal flex banners and hoardings. When the court demanded the BBMP what action it would take to remove the 1,880 hoardings, the civic body’s counsel spoke about filing criminal cases. Meanwhile, in an affidavit, the state government submitted that it had examined a letter that sought its approval for the BBMP Outdoor Signage and Public Messaging Policy, 2018, and the BBMP Outdoor Signage and Public Messaging Bylaws, 2018. The government said the policy was essentially a statement of intent and the government has no objections to it. As regards the bylaws, the BBMP has powers under section 425 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, to make them and submit them to the government for sanction. In short, the BBMP should just follow the procedure.The government doesn’t have to take any action as of now, the court was told. The Advocate General stated that he would submit the details of the appeals filed in the sessions court about the offences concerning illegal hoardings. The matter will be heard again on September 17. Govt okays ad bylawsThe Urban Development Department (UDD) on Tuesday approved the BBMP’s proposal on implementing the Outdoor Signage and Public Messaging Policy, 2018. The BBMP council had approved the policy to ban all commercial advertisements in the city following high court orders.

PIL seeks directions to prevent erosion of green cover	submit its response while hearing a public interest litigation challenging the government's failure to implement the provisions of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976.The court was hearing a petition filed by Dattatraya T Devare and the Bangalore Environment Trust, who moved the court against the rampant felling of trees in the city, and have sought directions to the respective authorities to carry out their duties in accordance with the provisions of the Tree Act.The petitioners have contended that the rapid erosion of the tree cover in the city has adversely affected the health of the residents and has led to a severe degradation of the environment. This is a violation of a resident's right to clean air and environment, they said. The petitioners have submitted that the state government, BBMP, forest department and the Bangalore Urban District Tree Authority have acted in complete dereliction of the statutory duties that defeat the very purpose of the Tree act. Their inaction has contributed to the rapid erosion of the tree cover in the city, they said. The case has been adjourned by two weeks.	green cover,Bengaluru,	 Sep 11 2018
White-topping near Kadugodi Rd leaves commuters in fix	"white-topping has left citizens in a quandary as the alternative routes take much longer for them to reach their destinations.For several months now, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has been doing the white-topping between Hope Farm and Belathur via Kadugodi Road. The work has hit regular commuters, especially those headed to the IT corridor of ITPL and Whitefield, who reside in the Kadugodi ward and its vicinity.Commuters could take two alternative roads to get around the traffic jam on Kadugodi Road. One is via Seegehalli in KR Puram and another via the Hoskote highway to reach Hope Farm and other parts of the city.Commuters, however, lament that they do not serve any purpose. The first route is too narrow for cars to navigate, while the second one is very long. ""I take two hours to reach office going by the Seegehalli route,"" said Nivya Swaminathan, who resides in Kadugodi.""Since the road is too narrow — and everyone takes this route to escape the traffic jam on the Kadugodi Road — it's clogged. Without traffic, I should take just 40 minutes to reach office,"" added Nivya. No prior notice Ramya, another commuter along the route, said the white-topping began without any prior intimation. ""The delays are only adding to our misery. The traffic police seem to have no plan on how to manage the traffic here at Kadugodi Road. Commuters themselves figured out the alternative routes,"" she said.The traffic police should at least think of stopping the trucks while the white-topping work is going on as they compound the commuters' misery during the peak hours, Ramya added.A BBMP official revealed that the white-topping project was stalled due to temporary suspension of the work by the civic administration. ""It's not just in Kadugodi, but also in other places where the white-topping work was taken up,"" he added.He said half of the work has been done and the remaining will be completed soon."	traffic congestion,Kadugodi Road,white-topping,	 Sep 09 2018

""It was concerned about the waterbody but did very little. By then, the sewage began streaming in and the lake was getting contaminated. All this was due to the blunders made by the BBMP.""It was then that seven to eight residents formed the Iblur Lake Forum and repeatedly sent petitions to the BDA on the lake's worsening condition.

""Also, people began dumping garbage on the lakebed.""Before the lake changed hands from the BDA to the BBMP in 2015, the former had fenced the lake in 2014 and removed encroachments after repeated petitions by the locals. With further prodding, the BBMP eventually began rejuvenating the lake in 2016.""The civic body first stopped sewage from streaming into the lake by building a diversion channel in 2017. It was de-silted three months ago and now, they are doing the bund formation,"" Sadasivan said.The lake's island is also getting a facelift, where residents are planning to plant trees, shrubs and reeds while the rains are active.""Fig, peepal, neem and Ficus glomerata (a variant of the fig tree) and other trees will be planted to attract birds,"" said another member of the Iblur Lake Forum.Those residing in apartments around the lake are also taking part in the rejuvenation activities during the weekends.

STPs new killing fields for manual scavengers	"toilets built under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan are the new killing fields for manual scavengers, a roundtable discussion at the National Law School of India University proclaimed on Saturday. At the roundtable discussion held by the NLSIU’s Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion, manual scavengers and members of the Karnataka State Safai Karmachari Kavalu Samiti (KSSKKS) narrated how the inhuman practice is taking a toll on their lives. K B Obalesh, state convenor, KSSKKS, said most sewage treatments in Bengaluru were illegal and there were no rules in place about their cleaning and maintenance. “There have been instances of manual scavengers dying due to sheer negligence of STP owners,” he said. “The lakhs of single pit toilets built under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan are no different for manual scavengers who have to clean them with bare hands.” Citing government data, the KSSKKS said there were 202 manual scavengers in Bengaluru Urban alone and all of them had been rehabilitated through various programmes. Representatives of the Tala Samudaya Research Centre stressed the need for carrying out a comprehensive survey with adequate publicity to identify manual scavengers in the state. “We are conducting a survey and have already identified more than 30,000 manual scavengers. We don’t know what was the basis of this government survey,” a member of the research centre told DH. Data provided at the meeting showed there are at least 25,000 sewage plants in Bengaluru alone. At least 78 manual scavengers have died while at work in Karnataka since 2008; six of them died while cleaning STPs. Dr Nataraj, treasurer, KSSKKS, lamented that nobody had ever been punished for causing manual scavenging deaths. “Though 24 cases were registered over manual scavenging, there has not been a single conviction. Police are also negligent as they open a case under IPC Section 304, which refers to deaths caused by negligence.They are not aware of the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act,"" he added.

Kaggadasapura locals on cleanup to counter BBMP dumping	garbage, residents of Kaggadasapura have decided to embark on a cleaning drive.On Saturday, they would remove garbage, and paint and beautify the area.“We want to make it look so good that it should be difficult for the civic body to dump garbage here any more,” said Tamanna Mishra, a local resident. While residents kept complaining about the garbage dumping in the area for many years, officials failed to address the issue.Chandrani Sarangi, who lives nearby, said the apathy by the civic body for many years has prompted them to undertake their own cleaning-up drive.“We’ll welcome it if the BBMP wants to have a dialogue with us. All that we want is to get the place cleaned up as it is in a bad shape for many years,” Chandrani said.Residents are at a loss to understand how the BBMP remains indifferent about the issue despite several high-ranking officials, including Mayor R Sampath Raj, visiting the place in July and directing them to clear the waste pile.

The road that remains elusive	Road, have no approach road after the Air Force closed the stretch last year citing security reasons. Members of the Navy Layout Welfare Association want the civic authorities and the local corporator to provide an alternative road to their locality. They raised the grievance at ‘Janaspandana-Citizens For Change’, a civic interactive platform organised by DH-Prajavani on Saturday. Anand Chaurasia, a resident of Navy Layout, said the locality with 10 homes had been cut off from Hesaraghatta Main Road, their gateway to the outside world. “The BBMP provided a road following several representations, but it is blocked by a BWSSB pipeline. It’s difficult to reach the main road,” he complained. Bagalkunte corporator K Narasimha Nayak conceded that the BBMP had failed to identify civic issues in the locality since it falls in Air Force area. “We failed to take notice of this locality until the last election when we learnt it comes in BBMP limits. We will surely help the residents to get a permanent approach road.” The residents also submitted a letter to Dasarahalli MLA, R Manjunatha, requesting basic facilities like streetlights, borewell and Cauvery water supply.

Students fret as BMTC switches to smart cards	provide smart cards in the place of student bus passes, school and college goers are inconvenienced as they are unable to avail the facility.Arguments between conductors insisting on full tickets and students asserting their right to travel in the concessional passes, and fellow commuters stepping in to pacify them, have become common occurrences in the buses.Schools began their academic year in the last week of May and the first week of June amidst debate over the merit of offering free bus passes.But as the BMTC introduced smart cards in the place of bus passes for the first time this year, nearly half of the eligible students commute paying for the full ticket fare.Amid the raging controversy over concessional passes, students say that getting the smartcards in the place of regular bus passes is an arduous task.“We applied for the bus pass, but are yet to avail the smart card. We’re asked to show our acknowledgement, receipt and ID card as proof,” said Shivani, one of the students.On Saturday, a conductor on board a bus to Mayo hall from Corporation circle was involved in a heated argument with students on the bus pass issue. The conductor said they are not instructed to accept acknowledgement in the place of a bus pass.Top BMTC officials acknowledged the delay in issuing the passes due to the delay in switching to smart cards. “There’s no issue with other transport companies. Even the KSRTC has dispensed with the applications. The delay is only with the BMTC,” said an official.The BMTC received 2.4 lakh applications for bus passes this year, out of which 1.05 lakh passes have been issued.The official concerned said there is no short supply of smart cards. “This is the first time we are giving smart cards. Previously, students had to come to designated centres and submit details and documents. Now it has been made available online,” said the official.He attributed the delay to students and institutions providing incorrect information, due to which forms had to be sent back for correction.

Residents move Lokayukta against BBMP officials	resident welfare associations in Indiranagar, have filed a complaint against Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad and other senior BBMP officials with Lokayukta.The complaint points out that the officials failed to implement zonal regulations in Indiranagar and blatantly allowed commercial establishments to come up in residential areas.Though the Karnataka High Court ordered BBMP to shut down illegal commercial establishments, the civic body is slow in taking action.For instance, Sneha Nandihal, a resident of the locality had filed a petition more than a year and a half ago, but no action has been taken yet.“BBMP accepted that there are violations (of zonal regulations) in the locality and they will take action, but the issue has not been resolved,” she said.Meanwhile, N Manjunath Prasad refused to comment on the issue without seeing the complaint.

E-buses to start plying on Bengaluru roads in October	city’s roads as Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is set to acquire them in about a month’s time.Olectra Greentech Ltd said on Wednesday that it is ready to supply electric buses to BMTC. The company is waiting for BMTC to hand over dedicated space for setting up charging stations at selected depots in the city, a top company official said.“BMTC has placed an order for 80 buses (60 A/C and 20 non-A/C buses) and we are ready to supply them. Once BMTC gives us space, we will set up charging stations, which are essential for commencing operations,” N K Rawal, managing director, Olectra Greentech told DH.He said the company requires about four weeks to complete the work on charging stations before BMTC commences operations of electric buses. The 12-metre-long A/C bus can seat 39, including a wheelchair occupant. It can travel up to 250 km on a single charge of five hours. The operating cost of these buses is around Rs 6-7 per km.Olectra Greetech (formerly Goldstone Infratech Ltd) manufactures electric buses in technical collaboration with Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd. It has set up a plant in Hyderabad to assemble electric buses.BMTC has received incentives from the Union government under Phase-1 of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) scheme. The government of India introduced Phase-1 of FAME in 2015 in a bid to promote eco-friendly mobility and offered incentives to state governments to purchase buses. Under the scheme, BMTC had planned to introduce 150 electric buses.In 2014, BMTC had conducted a trial run of electric buses supplied by BYD-Greentech and had shown interest in commercial operations.Rawal said that in all probability, BMTC could start operating electric buses in Bengaluru in October. The company has also bagged orders from Mumbai and Hyderabad transport undertakings. Mumbai is already running buses in Colaba and Hyderabad is likely to start operations in September.Olectra is also talking to various other state transport undertakings to supply buses under Phase-2 of FAME scheme. The company is also in talks with several private sector tour operators, schools and corporates to supply electric buses. It manufactures electric buses in 7, 9 and 12-metre variants.Olectra plans to set up a new manufacturing facility in Hyderabad spread over 250 acres. It plans to invest Rs 200 crore on the plant, which can make 2,000 buses a year.	Bengaluru,BMTC,e-buses,	 Aug 29 2018
Hackathon aims to crack city's waste water puzzle	to a slew of criticism.At a time when the city is battling a water crisis and witnessing a crying need for wastewater management, a team of experts hopes to brainstorm an idea to address the issues.A four-day hackathon is being organised by the Waste Impact Trust in partnership with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), United Way and others. The event, to be conducted at the IISc between September 1-2 and September 8-9, will identify low-cost, high-impact, inclusive solutions to the problem of water waste in Bengaluru. Fish deaths reported in Sankey, Lalbagh, Jakkur and Munnekolala lakes; frothing of Bellandur, Maragondanahalli, Rampura, Sarakki and Varthur lakes and an incident of fire in the Bellandur Lake have only marred the city’s reputation further, believe experts. People from economically weak and marginalised communities will participate along with the best talents of the country. The best solutions emerging from the hackathon will be incubated, implemented on the ground and scaled.Experts from IISc, entrepreneurs, technologists and waste management experts will sit together and discuss Bengaluru’s challenges of drinking water shortage and sewage. In the first phase of the event, ideas on issues that are to be addressed will be discussed. Following this, sustainable solutions will be designed and projects developed.A prize worth Rs 2 lakh will be given for developing the best idea coming out of the hackathon. A 45-day challenge will be open to all registered participants to showcase progress in their idea for a chance of incubation. The teams will be offered advice and coaching on developing a business canvas, building a business pitch and a business plan.The hackathon looks at creating profitable ventures. Gayitri Handanahal, managing trustee, Waste Impact Trust, said the hackathon starts by looking at the problems. “This includes a focus on lakes, STPs and other issues. This is a livelihood-focused hackathon. For instance, we will look at how people are cleaning lakes, and how it can be done,” she said.	waste management,Bengaluru,	 Aug 29 2018
Network connectivity issues at KIA	"in a twister of network connectivity issues over the past four days, disrupting cargo services and critical communication channels. Flight operations were, however, not affected until late Tuesday evening. Although the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) said passengers were not inconvenienced, the airport website was reportedly down for hours before it was restored. The airport's Twitter account had to tweet a passenger advisory that directed queries and requests for help to its call and WhatsApp numbers (9538882209/8884998888). A BIAL spokesperson attributed the problems to fluctuating connectivity of the airport's internal Wi-fi systems. ""Our IT Department is working to restore the services. Since the network has been fluctuating, we have supplied our partners with internet dongles and SIMs,"" the spokesperson said. The disruption in the airport's phone lines sparked big problems for critical internal communications. Until Tuesday night, it was not immediately known what caused the problems. The spokesperson, however, said issues would be resolved at the earliest. The Wi-fi connectivity problems forced some passengers to approach the airport officials, who could not immediately respond. A traveller, Apoorv Badami, tweeted wondering what the problem was. ""A lot of people are inconvenienced. So what is the workaround? Backup?"" Another passenger had this to tweet: ""Bangalore is world's software capital, yet the airport can't provide decent WiFi. How do foreigners without an Indian phone get a OTP? Change the WiFi access system. Simplify it."" Airport sources indicated that the technical issues were with the internal servers. At one point, even the official emails were not going through. The web check-in facilities were also affected, causing problems for passengers who frequently used them. This system was unavailable for a day, the sources said. The delay in resolving the network issues forced many sections within the airport to switch to manual mode. The sources said the services of at least one flight was partially affected. However, this could not be confirmed. On July 31, a glitch in the computer systems had briefly affected operations at the Mumbai Domestic and International Airport. All operations had been halted at both the T1 and T2 terminals of the airport."	wifi,flights,KIA,network,cargo,	 Aug 28 2018
BWSSB delays work, Dasarahalli roads in mess	"in MHR, MEI, Kirloskar and AGB layouts in Dasarahalli zone find it harder to navigate the roads.The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewage Corporation (BWSSB) dug up these roads to lay Cauvery water connections to the layouts, but it did not restore them. The lose mud has now turned slushy as a result of the rains. “A car can get stuck in the debris, while riding bikes here is a nightmare,” said an indignant Ravindra Nayak, a resident of MHR Layout.Residents also complain that the BWSSB did not bother to finish the pipe-laying in the residential roads.Prakash from AGB Layout said the dust floating around makes walking through the stretches a challenge. “How can one breathe in this condition?” he asked.Umadevi, a senior citizen who lives in the area for more than 15 years, said the mess reveals the lack of coordination between the civic agencies.""There has to be some coordination and accountability on the part of the civic agencies to finish the work soon. Water scarcity is the biggest problem in this area, but digging up and not repairing it or completing the road work has become the biggest problem,” she said, adding that the dust emanating from the debris enters homes and settles on everything.A BBMP official said it would take a few more days for the BWSSB to complete the pipe-laying work. “they’d hand over the roads to the BBMP after the work is over,” he said. “We’ll then restore the roads.”"	Roads,Dasarahalli zone,BWSSB,	 Aug 28 2018
Mahadevapura roads strewn with rubble	storm, but in reality the sand and dust on the roads of Mahadevapura is the result of intense construction activity.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has done very little to deal with the problem here. Residents complain that the BBMP is not cleaning up the arterial roads and streets, resulting in air pollution and flooding during the rains.They are also indignant over the BBMP’s apathy towards unauthorised dumping of C&D debris on the roadside, pavements and medians by various agencies. All it takes, they said, is the mechanised street cleaning.“The BBMP has deployed just one mechanised sweeper for the whole of Mahadevapura and cleans five or six arterial roads just once a month,” said Clement Jayakumar, a resident of Doddanekundi.The mechanised sweeper is unable to cover the stretch of ORR from Lowry Junction till Iblur, a heavy traffic area that has more sand and silt on the roadside, Jayakumar said. “We need at least one sweeper per ward since the construction activities are increasing,” he added.Residents complain that the authorities are only pointing fingers at each other rather than clearing the mess. “BBMP’s solid waste management department says it is the job of the engineering department as this’d be additional garbage, while the local ward engineers say they don’t even have a contract to remove sand on a regular basis,” lamented one Whitefield resident.BBMP Superintendent Engineer Nataraj said they have proposed an additional mechanised sweeper four days ago. “We just had one with which we cleaned dust and silt from the major roads. We’ll have an action plan once the other machine arrives,” he said. “ITPL, Sarjapur and KR Puram.”Nataraj also said the civic body is clearing the dust due to vehicular movement. “We will set up a separate dumping site for construction debris that will effectuate the mechanized cleaning. If two sweepers are not enough, we’ll ask for one more,” he assured.	road repair,Mahadevapura,BBMP,	 Aug 28 2018
Rising intolerance towards wildlife	around Bandipur Tiger Reserve is due to economic issues, revealed a recent study by scientists.According to the report 'The production of human-wildlife conflict: A political geography of encounter', there is little conflict because of tolerance towards wildlife and lifestyle changes.Authors, Jared D Margulies, from University of Sheffield, UK and Krithi K Karanth from Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS), state that local economics like the rise in coffee prices, exclusionary state approach prohibiting grazing in protected areas and shift from the low cost of traditional livestock to expensive hybrid cattle has resulted in the declining tolerance for wildlife.The research was conducted from 2015 to 2016 and relied on interviews with families living around Bandipur, veterinarians, animal husbandry experts and Karnataka forest department staff. Secondary data including livestock and human census data was also accounted.The study found the declining level of tolerance towards carnivores among agricultural communities near Bandipur had little to do with lifestyle or cultural changes in communities as claimed.Foundational changes taking place in rural livestock economy are creating new sites of encounters between humans and carnivores, often very close to human habitation. This, in turn, is reducing the communities’ tolerance towards carnivores.“Our research findings demonstrate the need to go beyond popular and often misleading narratives to identify and understand the various and complex social, political and economic linkages that often underlie human-carnivore interactions,” Krithi said.A more nuanced understanding of sources of human-wildlife conflict — in this case, the economic decision making of rural agrarian families — is indispensable for designing effective solutions that address conflicts between humans and carnivores in co-shared and contested landscapes. The study thus offers a valuable approach to employ the deeper inquiry required and contributes to the growing interdisciplinary field of human-wildlife interactions, she added.

HC seeks BMTC response on Volvo passes 	Corporation (BMTC) to submit its response while hearing a petition challenging a circular issued by the BMTC that states that free passes for Volvo buses will no longer be granted to persons suffering from blindness.A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari was hearing a public interest litigation filed by the National Federation of the Blind that moved the court seeking directions to the authorities to issue a fresh circular granting the facility of free bus passes to persons suffering from complete blindness for all buses in the state including the Vajra ( Volvo) buses.The petitioner contended that the circular is contrary to the policy instituted by the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation wherein several types of free bus passes had been made available for persons suffering from blindness in Karnataka.Furthermore, a corrigendum was issued that stated that people with a locomotor disability having disability concession passes and blind pass holders holding the free blind pass and having total blindness are given the opportunity for travelling in Vajra buses.The petitioner stated that the decision of the BMTC to withdraw the facility of a free bus pass for persons with disabilities without any valid reason is arbitrary in nature.The petitioner further contended that Section 41 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act states that the government shall develop schemes to promote the mobility of persons with disabilities at an affordable cost and should provide incentives and concessions.The concession for issuing free bus passes to persons with total visual impairment was made under the section and thus there is no rationale to withdraw the facility for Volvo buses.The petitioner also sought the facility of free bus passes to be extended to persons suffering from at least 40% blindness and benchmark disabilities.	volvos,visually impaired,HC,BMTC,free passes,	 Aug 28 2018
Single firm in the race to build 8 new skywalks	activists over building skywalks at places where they are not needed, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahangara Palike (BBMP) plans to construct eight new footbridges in various parts of the city. But more than the plan of building new skywalks, what may invite criticism is the fact that a single firm bid for all the projects in public-private partnership, a source in the BBMP told DH. Hyderabad-based Syed Iftequar Mehdi (M/s Ad Age Outdoor Advertising Pvt Ltd) is the only bidder for the project which has been sent to the BBMP council for approval. Padmanabha Reddy, the opposition leader in the BBMP council, said: “Building a skywalk is a sheer waste of money. In reality, no one uses skywalks. We will oppose the projects at the meeting on Tuesday.” When asked how could only one company bid for the project, Reddy said: “This aspect requires attention and we need to look into its details. If the company fulfils all the tender conditions, the BBMP can consider awarding the project to it. We will seek a clarification from the mayor on this.” Mayor R Sampath Raj said the project’s fate would be decided only after a detailed discussion in the council. “We will listen to what corporators have to say, and accordingly, we will take a call on the project,” he said.	skywalks,BBMP,	 Aug 28 2018

JP Park in Mathikere, MN Krishna Rao Park in Basavanagudi and Freedom Park on Seshadri Road incur huge maintenance costs. Freedom Park alone runs up an annual bill of Rs 1 crore. A senior BBMP official had this to say when asked about the need to charge people for visiting public places: ""I don't think it's right to compare a children's park with other parks such as Krishna Rao Park. The requirement and maintenance work are different here (in the Nandanavana Park). The expenditure is more because we have to remove fallen leaves and beautify the place. The Nandanavana park is a high-tech one and the focus is on maintaining the play equipment."" Gangadhar Swamy S, a deputy director in the BBMP's Horticulture Department, said maintenance costs in the Nandanavana Park were high because security guards work three shifts. ""We need round-the-clock security in this huge park,"" he said. Bahubali Raju, of Jayanagar 5th block Resident Welfare Association, said the entry fee was not an issue as it was nominal. ""They need money for maintenance. It's not wrong to charge visitors,"" he said."	BBMP,Jayanagar park,	 Aug 26 2018
BBMP lays Channasandra-Thirumalashettyhalli road	"BBMP has finally restored the Channasandra-Thirumalashettyhalli road in East Bengaluru.The 1.5-kilometre long road was dug up to lay pipes for the KC Valley project, which resulted in crater-size potholes that made commuting on that stretch a nightmare for the citizens.The road straddling Kadugodi ward and Hoskote taluk is a crucial link for 20 to 30 villages in the area to Whitefield, Kadugodi and the rest of the city.Residents, who accused the authorities of taking only temporary measures and not laying the road fully, are breathing easy as the condition of the road has been improving over the past 20 days.""This is an excellent road as it is three to four inches thicker,"" said Kumar K, a resident of Kadugodi. ""A month ago, the BBMP laid the road in just two days and it was damaged in a few days' time. After that, we urged the BBMP to lay a better road and we never expected it to be so good.""Residents are asking the BBMP to lay speed breakers as soon as possible since the heavy vehicles are zooming at a high speed. ""We have also asked the BBMP to install street lights throughout the stretch,"" added another resident.A BBMP official said the civic body is carrying out asphalting and drainage works simultaneously. ""We will finish the entire work by September,"" the official assured.The residents are planning a thanksgiving party for MLA Arvind Limbavali, the corporator and other BBMP officials as soon as the work is completed."

BBMP forms teams to inspect valleys	last year, the BBMP has formed three teams to check the problems around four valleys surrounding the city.Mayor R Sampath Raj held a meeting with the stormwater drains (SWD) engineers on Thursday and suggested to rope in more officers to inspect problems near the valleys so that measures could be taken to prevent waterlogging problems.The teams will look after four valleys — Koramangala, Challaghatta and Vrishabhavathi valley and Hebbal valley — and surrounding three km area from the valley, to find any obstructions, encroachments or problems and resolve them immediately.“A supervisor will head the teams and we will see to it that the rainwater flows through the designated routes without any obstruction and try to avoid the waterlogging situation,” said Bettegowda, chief engineer, stormwater drain, BBMP.Meanwhile, Chief Secretary T M Vijaybhaskar has ordered the BBMP to appoint additional officers across all eight zones to solve civic problems.These officers are entrusted with responsibilities that include, an inspection of the zone once in a month, to identify problems in respective zones and inform the concerned officer, to hold a meeting of all BBMP, BWSSB, BESCOM, PWD, police officers in the zone once a month, and report these issues to the chief secretary.	valleys,BBMP,	 Aug 24 2018
OFCs leave roads in a mess at Whitefield 	of hiccups, but the bane of their lives is optical fibre cable (OFC) service providers digging up roads, despite the BBMP’s blanket ban.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has swung into action against OFC service providers digging up roads without prior permission, but the problem persists in many areas of Mahadevapura, especially in Whitefield in the East Bengaluru region.Here, the residents wake up to dug-up roads that looked normal the previous day. Now, they are clueless about how to chart their future path.The EPIP zone in Whitefield is one such area that has borne the OFC brunt. “Four days ago, when digging began on one of the roads, I reported the matter immediately to the BBMP. After the Palike officials interfered, the OFC contractor cleared the area. But the activity resumed the following day at the same spot. They finished the work and left the damaged road as it is,” said Akshay Kumar, a corporate professional in the area.In a similar incident, the residents of one of the areas in Hagadur ward alerted the BBMP when illegal cable-digging was going on at midnight. The spot was cleared immediately.“The roads that we see one day do not remain the same. The contractors get them dug up during the night. When we demand the permission letter, they don’t produce it. They merely claim they have the required permission,” a resident of Hagadur said.Similar cases were reported from Seegehalli near KR Puram, Dinnur near Hebbal, Kundanahalli road, Marathahalli main road and other parts of Whitefield.BBMP chief engineer G Parameshwariah said: “Heavy penalties will be imposed by the government on those laying cables or digging roads without permission. We are attending to all the cases that are reported to us. It is difficult to fix accountability on unauthorised contractors. The BBMP officials have been asked to verify the authenticity of the contractors.”	OFC,Whitefield,BBMP,	 Aug 24 2018
Rock delays Muthuraj junction underpass 	plight of commuters on the outer ring road, especially near Hosakerehalli junction, as work on the Muthuraj junction underpass is getting delayed.Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is building a signal-free corridor from Mysuru Road junction to Central Silk Board junction crossing five intersections under the Nagarothana project. The Muthuraj junction, which is one such intersection, is a bi-directional underpass, is getting delayed due to the presence of a huge rock.The hard rock is being excavated using the controlled blast method. “This method uses rubber so that when there is an explosion, there is no danger of flying debris from the rock,” said K T Nagaraj, chief engineer, road infrastructure projects, BBMP. This consumes a lot of time, he said.Though the project was conceived in 2015 and was expected to be completed by the end of October this year, it may be ready only by the end of March, 2019.“It was only four months ago that the traffic police have given us traffic clearance, though we sought an approval last June.Now, we have shifted all utilities like power lines and BWSSB pipes. Also, Bescom’s overhead lines have been replaced by underground cables,” Nagaraj explained.Kathriguppe ward corporator M Venkatesh said they don’t want to inconvenience commuters anymore and added that work is now gathering pace. “Besides adopting controlled blasts, we are also using excavators to speed up work,” he said.Mayor R Sampath Raj, who inspected the site with engineers and MLA Ravi Subramanya said that 25% of the work is over and the remaining will be completed soon.

Vizag follows Bengaluru in adopting TenderSURE roads	"to go the Bengaluru way to develop TenderSURE roads.The port city, known famously as the Jewel of East Coast, is taking Bengaluru's TenderSURE model as a case study to solve the pothole menace on the roads.The TenderSURE model provides separate ducts along the streets to lay water, power, sanitary lines and also gas pipelines. This would prevent the road from being dug frequently and improve its durability.The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has implemented the TenderSURE model in St Mark's Road, Residency Road, Church Street and Museum Road.The Greater Visakhapatnam Smart City Corporation Limited (GVSCCL) has done a detailed study on the issues concerning roads and how they can be solved. The problems include lack of space for the physically challenged, unequal lane distribution, priority for speeding vehicles over pedestrian safety and inaccessible footpaths.The proposed model includes reduction of lane widths from 3.5m to 3.2m to provide more space for pedestrians, separate ducts for utilities, and street furniture, among others. Swati Ramanathan, founder of Janaagraha, a non-government organisation that is associated with urban local corporations to develop the TenderSURE model said: ""The Ministry of Urban Development has introduced TenderSURE as the best practice for municipal projects spearheading under 'Smart Roads'."" Cities like Davanagere and Nagpur are also including the model keeping Bengaluru as the case study since the project was first implemented here.Speaking about the project, a senior BBMP official said: ""The condition of the roads were deteriorating earlier as they were dug up multiple times either to lay power lines or cables or to repair water pipes. The TenderSURE model solves these issues.""K T Nagaraj, BBMP chief engineer, road infrastructure projects, said no one came for consultation from Visakhapatnam.Vishal Kundra from GVSCCL told Deccan Herald that Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu initiated the foundation-laying ceremony for the Smart City project on Thursday, and this would be a good start for the improvement of infrastructural facilities in the state."

Harvard Uni to fund projects to tackle city's garbage 	"units and new rules for solid waste management, now, the city has received an offer from the Harvard University to tackle the garbage menace.With efforts from senior IAS officer P Manivannan, through his fellowship at Harvard University, USD 30,000 has been granted for a solid waste management project for the city. A group of 40 active citizens, part of the project, will come up with a pilot project to utilise the funds to curb the mounting garbage problem.Manivannan refused to disclose details about the grant, saying it was too early to speak about it. The senior IAS officer, who is in the US at the moment, said the university has vacations till September 4 and once it reopens, he will be in a better position to talk about it.Sridhar Pabbisetty, an activist, and G R Chandran, e-governance consultant, are part of the citizen group that would come up with a project to ensure that the funds are efficiently used.According to Pabbisetty, Bengaluru has been facing issues with garbage for some time, and despite numerous plans and methods, it has not been implemented. ""Mysuru has successfully installed GPS in all their garbage trucks, but here it has not been effectively implemented. We need to address the whole indiscipline in the system,"" he added.Similarly, Chandran said the project will have to be approved by the university before the grants start rolling out. A sustainable project has to be in place to ensure it is not destabilised once the funds are exhausted.Hope from Harvard"	Harvard University,Bengaluru,	 Aug 23 2018
Lack of shelters bothers citizens along Hesaraghatta Rd	Hesaraghatta Main Road has greatly inconvenienced citizens using public transport.From five kilometres till Chikkabanavara, they have to wait for the bus under the scorching sun and during heavy rain. Bagalagunte, Bone Mill, Sapthagiri College, AGB Layout and Widia School are among the stops without a shelter.“We are at a danger of being mowed down by speeding vehicles,” said Pavan Kumar, a resident of Bagalagunte, noting that the hazard of waiting on the roadside for buses has been continuing for several years now, with no official bothering to put up a shelter.Susheela, a senior citizen residing in AGB Layout, said BMTC buses never stop at the designated spots due to lack of shelters. “Drivers of mofussil buses from Hesaraghatta are very rash,” she noted.Commuters want shelters to be put up at this stretch with seating facilities for the elderly citizens, students and women. Lack of shelters also affects students who have to board and alight the buses at various points.What BBMP says...BBMP chief engineer, Dasarahalli zone, Vijayakumar N said there was a proposal to widen the road, which did not happen.“If the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) comes up with a proposal, we are ready to put up shelters under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode,” he said.

Demand to convert CA sites into playgrounds on the rise	"amenity (CA) sites belonging to the Bangalore Development Authority to fund many schemes, the demand to convert them into playgrounds and parks is on the rise. This comes in the wake of a shortage of open spaces in the city.According to citizens and urban experts, instead of auctioning the CA sites, where the lease has expired, the government should convert them into parks and playgrounds.However, the BDA said citizens should help to maintain the parks and playgrounds.The BDA officials said the auctioning of the CA sites was proposed due to financial crisis. Converting them into open spaces and handing it over to the BBMP would not attract any finances.According to the BBMP records, there are 289 playgrounds and 1,299 parks of varied dimensions in the city. Further, the BDA's Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP)-2031 has earmarked only 4% for open spaces.The demand for playgrounds and parks also gained momentum after residents from Indiranagar and north Bengaluru recently voiced their opinion on the need for open spaces.Children at a loss""There is a shortage of playgrounds in the city. The government should think about the welfare of people, especially children. Since there is a lack of playgrounds, many children are forced to play on the streets,"" said Subhash B, a citizen.The recent report by the Centre for Ecological Sciences, IISc-Trees of Bengaluru, stated that concretisation has increased by 925% in Bengaluru from 1973- 2014. The city has lost 78% of its vegetation and open spaces.Urban planner V Ravichandar said there is a decline in the designated open spaces. The CDP shows that there is a deduction by 25% in the CDP in the past 25 years. The city needs more lung space and what better than parks and playgrounds, which have multiple objectives. The government cannot think of monetary gains always, he said.Noted urban planner Kodandapani, who drafted a few CDPs in the past, said the rules of 1976 of setting aside 15% space for parks and playgrounds and 10% for civic amenity sites have been long forgotten.All open spaces are being encroached and concretised as the value of land is very high. But the city needs more open spaces, especially in private layouts and developing areas, he added.BDA Commissioner Rakesh Singh said they would place the citizens 'suggestions before the government for consideration."

BBMP can't relax till city is free of flexes, says HC	"Justice Dinesh Maheshwari made this oral observation while hearing a petition, seeking directions for the removal of flexes and hoardings across the city.The counsel for the Palike submitted to the high court that it has received 1,192 responses along with documents with regard to the public notice and that the BBMP would examine the claims of having obtained permission for putting up advertisement hoardings.Responding to a question on how many cases pertaining to flexes and hoardings were pending in the courts, the counsel submitted that 112 petitions were pending before the high court, of which an interim order of stay has been granted in 44 cases. The counsel said 90 cases were pending in the civil court and an interim order has been granted in 26.The court was also informed that some hoardings continue to exist in areas beyond the BBMP limits, which come under different gram panchayats. The court said such gram panchayats would also be made a party in the petition.Status of the offendersWhile seeking to know the status of the bail applications and proceedings with regard to offences under the Karnataka Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act, 1981, the advocate general said 47 people have pleaded guilty till date.When the court sought to know the antecedents of those arrested, the advocate general replied that such people were not serial offenders or criminals and hence, no records were maintained. He added that records of antecedents are diligently maintained for criminals and serial offenders.On the court's suggestions, the advocate general promised to take steps to maintain a database of people booked for installation for illegal hoardings.The court also stated that by August-end the matter has to be concluded.It orally observed that at present, the mission of making the city free of flexes and hoardings was being accomplished by and large. ""If things are in control, then this is only the beginning. The ultimate aim is to restore the city back to its original glory,"" the court said.The court stated that the drive for removing flexes and hoardings should be extended to the whole state, and adjourned the case to August 31."

BDA issues notices to 70 civic amenity site holders	of recovering its civic amenity (CA) sites whose lease agreements has lapsed.The first step in this direction has been taken by slapping notices to lease-holders asking them to renew their lease agreements immediately. So far, the BDA has slapped notices to 70 CA site lease-holders (a copy of which is with DH).In the notice, the BDA has asked the lease-holders to pay the amount at the earliest failing which the BDA will initiate the process of recovering the sites in keeping with the BDA rules.The list of lease-holders whose licences have lapsed includes 25 government institutions like eight police stations, three belonging to the Department of Public Libraries, two each with the postal department, telephone exchange and Bengaluru University. The list also includes private institutions like 15 educational institutions, 12 religious establishments, private offices, choultries, nursing homes and hospitals and parks. The list also includes petrol bunks. These lease agreements were issued from 1962 to 1995. The sites of varied dimensions were allotted across the city.“We have been repeatedly serving notices to CA site holders to renew their lease agreement, but the response has been poor. According to BDA rules, if the lease tenure lapses, then the BDA is entitled to recover the sites. So far, we have not recovered any sites, but now we have decided to do so,” a senior BDA official said.Lease format revisedBDA allots sites under the Allotment Rules of CA Sites of 1989, which has a provision to recover sites where the lease agreement has lapsed. To generate earnings, the BDA had revised the lease format from 99 years to 30 years. But now, this has also become a challenge before the BDA and the state government.“Rules state that we can recover the sites after slapping three notices. But under political pressure and as a social obligation, we have been unable to do so. Many lease-holders assert that the renewal cost is too high,” the official said.The BDA, in 2016, had revised the renewal cost from 2011. The renewal rates were hiked by Rs 400-Rs 1,000 for different sectors, along with guidance value ranging from 2%-10% per square metre.12- Religious institutions8- police stations15- Educational institutions3- libraries5- medical institutions15 – Trusts, choultries, associations and committees	BDA,Civic amenity site,	 Aug 21 2018
